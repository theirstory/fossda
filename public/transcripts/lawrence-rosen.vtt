00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.759
<v Karen Herman:>Hello.

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.830
<v Karen Herman:>Today is October 31st in the year

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.850
<v Karen Herman:>2024.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.649
<v Karen Herman:>I'm Karen Herman, and I have the

5
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.750
<v Karen Herman:>pleasure of conducting an interview with Larry

6
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Karen Herman:>Rosen for the Free Stories Digital Archives

7
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Karen Herman:>Foundation.

8
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Karen Herman:>So welcome, Larry.

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Karen Herman:>Thank you so much for joining us

10
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Karen Herman:>today.

11
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Larry Rosen:>Thank you for inviting me.

12
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Larry Rosen:>Okay.

13
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Karen Herman:>So we're going to start right from

14
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Karen Herman:>the beginning.

15
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Karen Herman:>When and where were you born?

16
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Larry Rosen:>Say that again.

17
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.980
<v Karen Herman:>When and where were you born?

18
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.239
<v Larry Rosen:>I didn't hear your question.

19
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm sorry.

20
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, no.

21
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.589
<v Karen Herman:>No.

22
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Karen Herman:>It's okay.

23
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.319
<v Karen Herman:>When and where were you born?

24
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Larry Rosen:>When and where was I born?

25
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Larry Rosen:>Yes, I was born in New York

26
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Larry Rosen:>City.

27
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.920
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, the when was a long time

28
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Larry Rosen:>ago.

29
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Larry Rosen:>June 29th, 1945.

30
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

31
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Karen Herman:>Um.

32
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Karen Herman:>And talk a little bit.

33
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Karen Herman:>What was your childhood like?

34
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of kid were you?

35
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm hard of hearing.

36
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Larry Rosen:>So you're going to have to try

37
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Larry Rosen:>to enunciate your questions a little more

38
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Larry Rosen:>carefully.

39
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Karen Herman:>Understood.

40
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of kid were you growing

41
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Karen Herman:>up?

42
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Larry Rosen:>What kind of kid was I?

43
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, well, it depends on who you

44
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Larry Rosen:>ask, I guess.

45
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, my parents would probably say I

46
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Larry Rosen:>was a little bit of a trouble,

47
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Larry Rosen:>but actually, I was a pretty good

48
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Larry Rosen:>kid.

49
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Larry Rosen:>I went to school, I read, I

50
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Larry Rosen:>learned a lot.

51
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Larry Rosen:>I did well in school.

52
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Larry Rosen:>I did well in my life.

53
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Larry Rosen:>And, uh, I guess I was a

54
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Larry Rosen:>normal, ordinary, well brought up, happy young

55
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Larry Rosen:>boy.

56
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Karen Herman:>And talk about your education.

57
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Karen Herman:>Where did you go to college?

58
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, let me let me backtrack a

59
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.169
<v Larry Rosen:>little bit.

60
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Larry Rosen:>I was born in New York.

61
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Larry Rosen:>I was raised in Colorado.

62
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.929
<v Larry Rosen:>My parents moved to Colorado because my

63
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Larry Rosen:>father had a lung disease and he

64
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Larry Rosen:>needed to treat it.

65
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Larry Rosen:>And so we moved there.

66
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Larry Rosen:>And I grew up in Denver or

67
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Larry Rosen:>the outskirts of Denver, in a city

68
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Larry Rosen:>called Thornton.

69
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Larry Rosen:>I went to, uh, to uh, uh,

70
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Larry Rosen:>uh, preschool and, uh, high school and

71
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Larry Rosen:>so on in, in that area, when

72
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Larry Rosen:>it got time to apply to colleges,

73
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Larry Rosen:>I applied to a variety of them,

74
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Larry Rosen:>and I was admitted to Dartmouth College

75
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Larry Rosen:>in Hanover, New Hampshire, and I went

76
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Larry Rosen:>to college there, which was the best,

77
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Larry Rosen:>the luckiest opportunity I think I ever

78
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Larry Rosen:>had.

79
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Karen Herman:>What did you study.

80
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.459
<v Larry Rosen:>In college, I studied math and English.

81
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Larry Rosen:>I ended up with English mostly.

82
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Larry Rosen:>Turned out math was not exactly my

83
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Larry Rosen:>best forte.

84
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, and mostly because Dartmouth was the

85
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.650
<v Larry Rosen:>kind of college it was.

86
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.010
<v Larry Rosen:>They had just invented timesharing.

87
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Larry Rosen:>I studied computer science before there was

88
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Larry Rosen:>a computer science department.

89
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.220
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, I became a devotee of that.

90
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.400
<v Larry Rosen:>I played with the computers that they

91
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Larry Rosen:>made available to all of us.

92
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.920
<v Larry Rosen:>They had computers in the student rooms.

93
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.850
<v Larry Rosen:>Student.

94
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.790
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, not dormitories, but the the student

95
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Larry Rosen:>buildings.

96
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Larry Rosen:>And I went and I studied and

97
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Larry Rosen:>I learned basic, which was the language

98
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Larry Rosen:>invented at Dartmouth specifically for time sharing.

99
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Larry Rosen:>And I became one of the devotees

100
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Larry Rosen:>of that language.

101
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Larry Rosen:>I wrote programs for it.

102
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Larry Rosen:>I helped to design and implement certain,

103
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Larry Rosen:>uh, training manuals for myself and other

104
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Larry Rosen:>students.

105
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Larry Rosen:>And I became a, uh, an expert

106
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Larry Rosen:>in computer science, such as there were

107
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Larry Rosen:>experts in those days, in addition to,

108
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Larry Rosen:>uh, a normal education in a liberal

109
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Larry Rosen:>arts institution.

110
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Larry Rosen:>And the good combination, liberal arts and

111
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Larry Rosen:>computer science is a combination I would

112
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Larry Rosen:>recommend to people.

113
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Larry Rosen:>They should be able to talk about

114
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Larry Rosen:>something other than how to program, and

115
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.830
<v Larry Rosen:>I learned how to do many other

116
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Larry Rosen:>things besides programming.

117
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.420
<v Karen Herman:>What did you want to do with

118
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Karen Herman:>that when you graduated?

119
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.220
<v Larry Rosen:>I wasn't sure, but I applied to

120
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.230
<v Larry Rosen:>graduate school and was admitted to University

121
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.010
<v Larry Rosen:>of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and

122
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.570
<v Larry Rosen:>studied computer science.

123
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Larry Rosen:>I was in their computer science department.

124
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Larry Rosen:>It was a very interesting, not very

125
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Larry Rosen:>happy part of my life.

126
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Larry Rosen:>I was not happy being isolated in

127
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.700
<v Larry Rosen:>North Carolina.

128
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Larry Rosen:>I found the school and the department

129
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Larry Rosen:>too conservative for my tastes, and so

130
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.180
<v Larry Rosen:>I lasted there a few years and

131
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.070
<v Larry Rosen:>then went off to work in New

132
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Larry Rosen:>York City as a programmer.

133
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of things were you programming?

134
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.970
<v Larry Rosen:>The first program I remember working on

135
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.370
<v Larry Rosen:>was kind of weird.

136
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.920
<v Larry Rosen:>It was, um, it was a program

137
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.620
<v Larry Rosen:>to try to determine what people's sign

138
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.540
<v Larry Rosen:>was in their, uh, when they were

139
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.260
<v Larry Rosen:>born and what kinds of influences the

140
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.419
<v Larry Rosen:>planets were having on them.

141
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.909
<v Larry Rosen:>And I wrote those programs and didn't

142
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.710
<v Larry Rosen:>believe a word of it, but I

143
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.979
<v Larry Rosen:>wrote and they asked me to develop

144
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.980
<v Larry Rosen:>software for that, and I did that

145
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Larry Rosen:>until I got a what I would

146
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Larry Rosen:>call a real job at RCA, then

147
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.919
<v Larry Rosen:>in new Jersey, that had a computer

148
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Larry Rosen:>business that they were running.

149
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Larry Rosen:>They were going to be the IBM

150
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Larry Rosen:>of, I guess, of the future.

151
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.929
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, that lasted for a few years.

152
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Larry Rosen:>I was involved in helping them to

153
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Larry Rosen:>develop the operating system software for their

154
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Larry Rosen:>computers, uh, particularly the database aspects of

155
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.669
<v Larry Rosen:>their software.

156
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Larry Rosen:>And it was quite a learning experience

157
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.239
<v Larry Rosen:>as well as gratifying in terms of

158
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Larry Rosen:>developing stuff that was real software as

159
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Larry Rosen:>opposed to, uh, what's your sign and

160
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Larry Rosen:>what's your what planets you were born

161
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Larry Rosen:>under.

162
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Larry Rosen:>But, um, driving home one day on

163
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.580
<v Larry Rosen:>a weekend, I guess it was on

164
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.599
<v Larry Rosen:>a Friday.

165
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Larry Rosen:>I was listening to NBC news on

166
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Larry Rosen:>the radio, and there was an announcement

167
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Larry Rosen:>that RCA decided to go out of

168
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Larry Rosen:>the computer business, which left me kind

169
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.989
<v Larry Rosen:>of perplexed as to what to do

170
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Larry Rosen:>next.

171
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.320
<v Larry Rosen:>But it turns out that because I

172
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Larry Rosen:>was in their development department and involved

173
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Larry Rosen:>very deeply in the development of their

174
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Larry Rosen:>database and their operating system, I was

175
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Larry Rosen:>part of the departments that were kept

176
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.520
<v Larry Rosen:>on, and we were kept on in

177
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.079
<v Larry Rosen:>order to be sold.

178
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.740
<v Larry Rosen:>And so I proceeded to start to

179
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.880
<v Larry Rosen:>look for jobs, even though I continued

180
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.330
<v Larry Rosen:>to draw salary and work for RCA

181
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Larry Rosen:>Until I ended up with a job

182
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Larry Rosen:>in California, and it was a company

183
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.670
<v Larry Rosen:>called Memorex.

184
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.690
<v Larry Rosen:>They may.

185
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.300
<v Larry Rosen:>For all I know, they're still around.

186
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.010
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't know for sure.

187
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:07.880
<v Larry Rosen:>And they recruited me and put my

188
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.819
<v Larry Rosen:>furniture on a truck and put my

189
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Larry Rosen:>dogs in and their puppies in my

190
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Larry Rosen:>car.

191
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.839
<v Larry Rosen:>And we drove to California and I

192
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.220
<v Larry Rosen:>showed up for work.

193
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.189
<v Larry Rosen:>And the day I showed up, they

194
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Larry Rosen:>said, oh, by the way, we've decided

195
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Larry Rosen:>we're going to cut back.

196
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.900
<v Larry Rosen:>And so your job is no longer.

197
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Larry Rosen:>So there I was, sitting in a

198
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Larry Rosen:>motel room with my dog, my furniture

199
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Larry Rosen:>on a truck, and Wondering what I

200
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Larry Rosen:>was going to do.

201
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Larry Rosen:>It turns out I got another temporary

202
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Larry Rosen:>job, which was gross programming, sitting in

203
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Larry Rosen:>an office with three other programmers, writing

204
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Larry Rosen:>software that I didn't believe in, and

205
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Larry Rosen:>I proceeded to earn a salary and

206
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Larry Rosen:>live in my motel room until I

207
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Larry Rosen:>got settled.

208
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, I ended up finding a

209
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Larry Rosen:>job at a company called Rome r

210
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Larry Rosen:>o m.

211
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Larry Rosen:>You may have heard of them.

212
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Larry Rosen:>They were in the telephone systems business,

213
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Larry Rosen:>and, um, they hired me to help

214
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Larry Rosen:>them develop a program, develop their software,

215
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Larry Rosen:>and develop, um, their applications.

216
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.150
<v Larry Rosen:>that lasted for about nine years.

217
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.260
<v Karen Herman:>When did you start?

218
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.610
<v Karen Herman:>What year did you start?

219
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Larry Rosen:>Oh my goodness.

220
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, I.

221
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.460
<v Larry Rosen:>That's a good question I don't remember.

222
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Larry Rosen:>Okay.

223
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.360
<v Larry Rosen:>It was in the early '80s, I

224
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.930
<v Larry Rosen:>think.

225
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

226
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.609
<v Karen Herman:>It looks it looks like maybe '82.

227
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Larry Rosen:>That sounds like I'm glad you're better

228
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.680
<v Larry Rosen:>at my, uh, resume than I am,

229
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Larry Rosen:>but I ended up working for them.

230
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Larry Rosen:>They were known as, quote, a great

231
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.790
<v Larry Rosen:>place to work in the Bay area.

232
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.040
<v Larry Rosen:>And it was true.

233
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.330
<v Larry Rosen:>They had all sorts of facilities for

234
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:39.370
<v Larry Rosen:>employees to participate to, to do sports,

235
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Larry Rosen:>to do that a swimming pool they

236
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Larry Rosen:>had.

237
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Larry Rosen:>Training opportunities.

238
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Larry Rosen:>I really enjoyed them.

239
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.530
<v Larry Rosen:>They were a good company and I

240
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.430
<v Larry Rosen:>learned a lot.

241
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.750
<v Larry Rosen:>And I became responsible for some of

242
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.900
<v Larry Rosen:>their database software and became experienced in

243
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.370
<v Larry Rosen:>that field.

244
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.770
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, that worked very well until

245
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.050
<v Larry Rosen:>they decided that they were going to

246
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.840
<v Larry Rosen:>sell to IBM, which at the time

247
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.459
<v Larry Rosen:>was the first company.

248
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.250
<v Larry Rosen:>We were the first company that IBM

249
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.449
<v Larry Rosen:>ever bought.

250
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.240
<v Larry Rosen:>So all of a sudden I found

251
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.490
<v Larry Rosen:>myself, uh, a member of a company

252
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.760
<v Larry Rosen:>that had a reputation for being rather

253
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.819
<v Larry Rosen:>big, rather, um, managerial and its style

254
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Larry Rosen:>and somewhat different.

255
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Larry Rosen:>I was able to stay at Rome

256
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Larry Rosen:>slash IBM during a time when they

257
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.829
<v Larry Rosen:>were still giving sabbaticals to their employees.

258
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Larry Rosen:>So if you work for six or

259
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Larry Rosen:>more years, you had an opportunity to

260
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:11.350
<v Larry Rosen:>take a lengthy sabbatical, which I did,

261
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Larry Rosen:>and I went to Europe and I

262
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Larry Rosen:>enjoyed myself, and I learned a bunch

263
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Larry Rosen:>of things and did a bunch of

264
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Larry Rosen:>things to become, I guess, better trained,

265
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Larry Rosen:>better educated.

266
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, IBM was a strange place

267
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Larry Rosen:>to work.

268
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Larry Rosen:>It was a good place in that

269
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640
<v Larry Rosen:>they did.

270
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.040
<v Larry Rosen:>They treated their employees well.

271
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.569
<v Larry Rosen:>They treated us well.

272
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.290
<v Larry Rosen:>They, uh, they wanted to make a

273
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.589
<v Larry Rosen:>success out of the telecommunications business.

274
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.050
<v Larry Rosen:>And it turns out they didn't know

275
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.960
<v Larry Rosen:>squat about telecommunications.

276
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.069
<v Larry Rosen:>And so they ended up selling us

277
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.370
<v Larry Rosen:>as a business to Siemens.

278
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.900
<v Larry Rosen:>And I ended up working at Siemens.

279
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:15.890
<v Larry Rosen:>Same office, same complex, same co-workers, working

280
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.540
<v Larry Rosen:>on similar businesses.

281
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.050
<v Larry Rosen:>But the the company name changed on

282
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Larry Rosen:>the signs outside on the street.

283
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.630
<v Larry Rosen:>It was um, also an interesting experience.

284
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, German industry is different from IBM.

285
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Larry Rosen:>It's quite a bureaucratic in some sense.

286
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Larry Rosen:>They're the head of there who they

287
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Larry Rosen:>assigned to be in charge of us

288
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Larry Rosen:>was one of those, I will tell

289
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.550
<v Larry Rosen:>you what to do kind of people.

290
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.260
<v Larry Rosen:>And we did and we developed database

291
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.270
<v Larry Rosen:>software and so on.

292
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.479
<v Larry Rosen:>But I grew tired of that.

293
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:11.290
<v Larry Rosen:>I just couldn't find a comfortable personal

294
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.640
<v Larry Rosen:>situation working for a German company to

295
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.480
<v Larry Rosen:>develop software that I don't think they

296
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.550
<v Larry Rosen:>knew much about what they were doing.

297
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.550
<v Larry Rosen:>In point of fact, several years after

298
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.990
<v Larry Rosen:>I left there, they ended up doing

299
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Larry Rosen:>other things.

300
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Larry Rosen:>But in any event, I went to

301
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.430
<v Larry Rosen:>Stanford University.

302
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Larry Rosen:>I hope I'm doing this in the

303
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:47.390
<v Larry Rosen:>right sequence and became responsible for a

304
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Larry Rosen:>database package called Spires, which was a

305
00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:01.819
<v Larry Rosen:>really innovative database system in that individual

306
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Larry Rosen:>departments, individuals in the business, in the

307
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Larry Rosen:>Stanford business, would be able to develop

308
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Larry Rosen:>their own database applications.

309
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Larry Rosen:>So I was responsible for training them

310
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Larry Rosen:>for developing their applications, for helping them

311
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:28.400
<v Larry Rosen:>to take advantage of the database software

312
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Larry Rosen:>that was developed there.

313
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.729
<v Larry Rosen:>And it was really quite an opportunity.

314
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.100
<v Larry Rosen:>First of all, to become familiar with

315
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.430
<v Larry Rosen:>many aspects of the university.

316
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.599
<v Larry Rosen:>I remember writing applications of, for one

317
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.939
<v Larry Rosen:>department or another that helped them to

318
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.390
<v Larry Rosen:>do what their function was in the

319
00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:00.449
<v Larry Rosen:>university, and I enjoyed it.

320
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.400
<v Larry Rosen:>I enjoyed meeting them.

321
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.369
<v Larry Rosen:>I enjoyed writing applications.

322
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:09.089
<v Larry Rosen:>I built a small staff of people

323
00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.710
<v Larry Rosen:>who worked on that.

324
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.119
<v Larry Rosen:>Eventually I became head of the, uh,

325
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.550
<v Larry Rosen:>sort of, uh.

326
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.839
<v Larry Rosen:>Development department in the Stanford Computer Center

327
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.600
<v Larry Rosen:>that hired out to other departments to

328
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.439
<v Larry Rosen:>help them to develop applications.

329
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Larry Rosen:>And so as a result, I became

330
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Larry Rosen:>even more familiar with the university, even

331
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Larry Rosen:>more familiar with the applications of helping

332
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Larry Rosen:>students educate themselves.

333
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Larry Rosen:>I did a lot of teaching.

334
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.670
<v Larry Rosen:>I taught a lot of computer programming

335
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.870
<v Larry Rosen:>classes.

336
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.830
<v Larry Rosen:>I developed a software department that that

337
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.389
<v Larry Rosen:>had other people that worked on developing

338
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.830
<v Larry Rosen:>software training for the university, and it

339
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.180
<v Larry Rosen:>was rewarding.

340
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.300
<v Larry Rosen:>I worked there, I think 11 years.

341
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.970
<v Larry Rosen:>It was it was very good.

342
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.120
<v Larry Rosen:>But I became aware of the fact

343
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.450
<v Larry Rosen:>that if you're at a university and

344
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.520
<v Larry Rosen:>you're not on the faculty, you're not

345
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.450
<v Larry Rosen:>anything.

346
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Larry Rosen:>It isn't quite that you're not anything.

347
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Larry Rosen:>It's just that you're you're not going

348
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Larry Rosen:>to go very far.

349
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Larry Rosen:>You're not going to become, uh, whatever,

350
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Larry Rosen:>uh, main faculty member is in the

351
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:42.659
<v Larry Rosen:>university.

352
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Larry Rosen:>So I decided to look around for

353
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Larry Rosen:>other opportunities.

354
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Larry Rosen:>And that was when I decided that

355
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.770
<v Larry Rosen:>it was time to take advantage of

356
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Larry Rosen:>another, uh, goal that I had had

357
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Larry Rosen:>for many years, which was to study

358
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:10.710
<v Larry Rosen:>law to try to become a lawyer.

359
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Larry Rosen:>And they were very supportive.

360
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.629
<v Larry Rosen:>They allowed me to do that.

361
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.500
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, in part, they helped pay for

362
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Larry Rosen:>it.

363
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Larry Rosen:>It was it was a great opportunity.

364
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.210
<v Larry Rosen:>I got admitted to a great law

365
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.870
<v Larry Rosen:>department at Santa Clara University.

366
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.149
<v Larry Rosen:>They had a night program, so I

367
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.310
<v Larry Rosen:>was able to do my work at

368
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.419
<v Larry Rosen:>Stanford during the day and study law

369
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.889
<v Larry Rosen:>at nights and weekends.

370
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.080
<v Larry Rosen:>And whenever I was alone in the

371
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.050
<v Larry Rosen:>car driving off to see my parents

372
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.879
<v Larry Rosen:>or whatever I was doing.

373
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.740
<v Larry Rosen:>So four years later, I graduated from

374
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.760
<v Larry Rosen:>law school with a law degree, and

375
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.469
<v Larry Rosen:>by that time, I was not the

376
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Larry Rosen:>sort of person that would be hired

377
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.860
<v Larry Rosen:>in a big law firm to, you

378
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.320
<v Larry Rosen:>know, work his way up to senior

379
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.889
<v Larry Rosen:>partner.

380
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Larry Rosen:>There were others I went to school

381
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.100
<v Larry Rosen:>with who did, but they were a

382
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.740
<v Larry Rosen:>little younger and a little bit more

383
00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.110
<v Larry Rosen:>adventurous, perhaps, than I was.

384
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Larry Rosen:>And some of them were quite successful.

385
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.780
<v Larry Rosen:>And I passed the bar right away.

386
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.420
<v Larry Rosen:>So I became a lawyer, and I

387
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.130
<v Larry Rosen:>went to work for a law firm

388
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.740
<v Larry Rosen:>that turned out to be not so

389
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.280
<v Larry Rosen:>much fun, and I went off and

390
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Larry Rosen:>decided to be a lawyer on my

391
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:47.690
<v Larry Rosen:>own to to be by myself an

392
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:52.790
<v Larry Rosen:>attorney, helping with computer programming and with

393
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:58.070
<v Larry Rosen:>computer software and to to to continue

394
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.260
<v Larry Rosen:>combining my computer science degrees with my

395
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.580
<v Larry Rosen:>law degree.

396
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.640
<v Larry Rosen:>And I figured I could do that

397
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.639
<v Larry Rosen:>more effectively than working for, um, a

398
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.450
<v Larry Rosen:>law firm that really had no concept

399
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.750
<v Larry Rosen:>of what computer software was about.

400
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.680
<v Larry Rosen:>And.

401
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.280
<v Larry Rosen:>Yeah.

402
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.750
<v Karen Herman:>Was that your intent?

403
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.909
<v Larry Rosen:>It wasn't a rewarding.

404
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Larry Rosen:>Was that your pardon?

405
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Karen Herman:>Was that your intent when you got

406
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Karen Herman:>the law degree to to be able

407
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Karen Herman:>to combine that with the computer technology?

408
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Karen Herman:>Was that.

409
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Larry Rosen:>Absolutely.

410
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Larry Rosen:>Absolutely.

411
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Larry Rosen:>There.

412
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Larry Rosen:>I love computers, I love doing computers.

413
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Larry Rosen:>I love I met many people in

414
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Larry Rosen:>the Bay area who were involved in

415
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Larry Rosen:>computers.

416
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Larry Rosen:>I made many friends, uh, discovered various

417
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Larry Rosen:>things that were going on.

418
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Larry Rosen:>One of the friends that I met

419
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Larry Rosen:>was a software developer who at the

420
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Larry Rosen:>time worked for Xerox and, uh, developed

421
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Larry Rosen:>Small talk, which was a computer programming

422
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Larry Rosen:>language.

423
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.429
<v Larry Rosen:>And he was a good friend of

424
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Larry Rosen:>mine.

425
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Larry Rosen:>And we worked and we talked and

426
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Larry Rosen:>he said, you know, I'm, I'm working

427
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Larry Rosen:>with this organization on the East Coast

428
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Larry Rosen:>called the Open Source Initiative.

429
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.260
<v SPEAKER_S3:>And he says, would.

430
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.790
<v Larry Rosen:>You like to meet them?

431
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:28.970
<v Larry Rosen:>Why not?

432
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.860
<v Larry Rosen:>And I did meet them, and I

433
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.990
<v Larry Rosen:>found them very interesting and very challenging.

434
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.670
<v Larry Rosen:>And I found that their objective of

435
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.149
<v Larry Rosen:>providing free software, I don't want to

436
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Larry Rosen:>use the word free, but let's call

437
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.870
<v Larry Rosen:>it open source software.

438
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.949
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, was a good idea.

439
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.189
<v Larry Rosen:>It sort of tied in many ways

440
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.050
<v Larry Rosen:>to what I was doing at a

441
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.639
<v Larry Rosen:>university, where the objective was not to

442
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Larry Rosen:>make money.

443
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.060
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, the department I was in charge

444
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.940
<v Larry Rosen:>of was not a profit center.

445
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.810
<v Larry Rosen:>It was, um, had to survive, but

446
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.470
<v Larry Rosen:>it would its its objective was to

447
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.980
<v Larry Rosen:>do good things for the university and

448
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.389
<v Larry Rosen:>for the faculty and so on, and

449
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.969
<v Larry Rosen:>ozone seem to have some of the

450
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.489
<v Larry Rosen:>same objectives.

451
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.310
<v Larry Rosen:>And I began to meet with them,

452
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.220
<v Larry Rosen:>and I began to meet their people.

453
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:39.510
<v Larry Rosen:>And I became enamored of their organization.

454
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.659
<v Larry Rosen:>And they said, well, look, you have

455
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:47.790
<v Larry Rosen:>a college background in computers and you

456
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.270
<v Larry Rosen:>have a college background in law, and

457
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.320
<v Larry Rosen:>that's a good combination for doing licensing

458
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.760
<v Larry Rosen:>kinds of things.

459
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.590
<v Larry Rosen:>That open source initiative.

460
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.110
<v Larry Rosen:>Would you like to come and join

461
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.649
<v Larry Rosen:>us?

462
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.659
<v Larry Rosen:>Now, of course, I had a practice.

463
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.990
<v Larry Rosen:>I was working with various companies and

464
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.870
<v Larry Rosen:>doing various legal things.

465
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.179
<v Larry Rosen:>And, you know, whatever walked in the

466
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.460
<v Larry Rosen:>door became a client.

467
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.160
<v Larry Rosen:>But I was also very interested in

468
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.990
<v Larry Rosen:>that combination.

469
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.150
<v Larry Rosen:>I liked writing.

470
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Larry Rosen:>I like teaching.

471
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Larry Rosen:>I like working with software.

472
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.899
<v Larry Rosen:>And this seemed like an interesting combination.

473
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Larry Rosen:>And it was.

474
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Karen Herman:>So this was about 1997.

475
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Karen Herman:>Is that about the year?

476
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

477
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Larry Rosen:>Somewhere around in that time.

478
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Karen Herman:>When was the first time that you

479
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.110
<v Karen Herman:>heard about open source?

480
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Karen Herman:>Was it through OSI or did you

481
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Karen Herman:>know about open source even earlier than

482
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Karen Herman:>that?

483
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, my friend had told me a

484
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Larry Rosen:>bunch about open source and what it

485
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Larry Rosen:>was.

486
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Larry Rosen:>He had formed a company that developed

487
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Larry Rosen:>software that was released under a commercial

488
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.260
<v Larry Rosen:>first, then open source software license, and

489
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Larry Rosen:>he taught me about how he did

490
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Larry Rosen:>that.

491
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.820
<v Larry Rosen:>And I watched all the software that

492
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.710
<v Larry Rosen:>he wrote and the people that he

493
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Larry Rosen:>worked with.

494
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.169
<v Larry Rosen:>And of course, I met many people

495
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.700
<v Larry Rosen:>in the community.

496
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:26.010
<v Larry Rosen:>Silicon Valley was a dynamic, uh, environment

497
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.160
<v Larry Rosen:>at that time, and I met many

498
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.300
<v Larry Rosen:>people who were supportive and who understood

499
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.649
<v Larry Rosen:>open source and, you know, ended up

500
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.320
<v Larry Rosen:>meeting people who were mostly on the

501
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.100
<v Larry Rosen:>East Coast.

502
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.470
<v Larry Rosen:>But, you know, we talked and, um,

503
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:52.740
<v Larry Rosen:>I discovered that they had good objectives.

504
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.910
<v Larry Rosen:>They wanted to develop open source software

505
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.750
<v Larry Rosen:>that people could use that was not

506
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.940
<v Larry Rosen:>designed to make money.

507
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.420
<v Larry Rosen:>That was, um, unusual for me.

508
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.880
<v Larry Rosen:>It was not exactly something I could

509
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.350
<v Larry Rosen:>relate to.

510
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.360
<v Larry Rosen:>Making money is not a foreign thing

511
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.230
<v Larry Rosen:>for me.

512
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.870
<v Larry Rosen:>I had to pay my mortgage and

513
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.889
<v Larry Rosen:>I, you know, I had to live.

514
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:29.560
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, I found that the people

515
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.110
<v Larry Rosen:>that were in the open source community

516
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.660
<v Larry Rosen:>were fascinating.

517
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.770
<v Larry Rosen:>They were all very different.

518
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.700
<v Larry Rosen:>They were all politically astute.

519
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.050
<v Larry Rosen:>Among the things that I found was

520
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Larry Rosen:>that they were, for the most part,

521
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.040
<v Larry Rosen:>gun nuts.

522
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.360
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, Second Amendment was more important than

523
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.030
<v Larry Rosen:>the First Amendment to them, which was

524
00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.890
<v Larry Rosen:>a little bit unusual for me.

525
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.450
<v Larry Rosen:>I've never used a gun in my

526
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.550
<v Larry Rosen:>life and have no intention of it.

527
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.629
<v Larry Rosen:>In fact, one of the people that

528
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:13.300
<v Larry Rosen:>I met through that organization had resigned

529
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Larry Rosen:>from the OSI board because he thought

530
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Larry Rosen:>they were threatening him with guns.

531
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't want to mention names because

532
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Larry Rosen:>it's someone you've already interviewed, but, um,

533
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.290
<v Larry Rosen:>there was a kind of a tension

534
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Larry Rosen:>in the organization, and I tried to

535
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:45.240
<v Larry Rosen:>work to, to resolve the tension, to

536
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Larry Rosen:>get them to work together, to get

537
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Larry Rosen:>them to forgive each other for whatever

538
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Larry Rosen:>slights they had read.

539
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Larry Rosen:>And, uh, I did a certain amount

540
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Larry Rosen:>of that successfully and a certain amount,

541
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Larry Rosen:>not because, you know, working with Richard

542
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Larry Rosen:>Stallman is not the easiest thing in

543
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.930
<v Larry Rosen:>the world.

544
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.590
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, and several others on that board.

545
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:16.780
<v Karen Herman:>Can you talk a little bit about

546
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.419
<v Karen Herman:>Richard Stallman or your relationship with him?

547
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.440
<v Larry Rosen:>I met him through ISI.

548
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.780
<v Larry Rosen:>He was not on the OSI board,

549
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.150
<v Larry Rosen:>but he was, of course, a very

550
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.270
<v Larry Rosen:>powerful figure in the open source community.

551
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.240
<v Larry Rosen:>He had developed the GPL license, which

552
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Larry Rosen:>I read and appreciated.

553
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:42.970
<v Larry Rosen:>And I met his legal advisor, who

554
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:48.940
<v Larry Rosen:>was a professor at Columbia University, and

555
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.110
<v Larry Rosen:>was able to talk to him and

556
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:56.740
<v Larry Rosen:>to share a little bit about what

557
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.490
<v Larry Rosen:>open source and free software was all

558
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.420
<v Larry Rosen:>about.

559
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.490
<v Larry Rosen:>In fact, I remember one time he

560
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.520
<v Larry Rosen:>came to California and we sat in

561
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.889
<v Larry Rosen:>a restaurant, the two of us, and

562
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.290
<v Larry Rosen:>talked about open source and free software.

563
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Larry Rosen:>And I quite frankly, I found him

564
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.710
<v Larry Rosen:>to be a rather strange personality, but.

565
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Larry Rosen:>We're all strange.

566
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.130
<v Larry Rosen:>We all had our quirks and our

567
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.140
<v Larry Rosen:>imbalances.

568
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, I just was able to

569
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:39.979
<v Larry Rosen:>share his desire for free software.

570
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.620
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, but I didn't like his license.

571
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.139
<v Larry Rosen:>I found there were deficiencies in the

572
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.740
<v Larry Rosen:>license.

573
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.520
<v Larry Rosen:>And the law professor from Columbia that

574
00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.780
<v Larry Rosen:>had served as his, as Richard's law

575
00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.879
<v Larry Rosen:>advisor was largely a jerk.

576
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Larry Rosen:>And and he kept insisting on certain

577
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.419
<v Larry Rosen:>aspects of the the legal basis for

578
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Larry Rosen:>law in the open source community that

579
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Larry Rosen:>I found strange and unsupportable.

580
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Larry Rosen:>And he was just sort of like

581
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Larry Rosen:>a mean person.

582
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Larry Rosen:>Anyway, so he and I did not

583
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Larry Rosen:>get along very well, and he used

584
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.229
<v Larry Rosen:>to call me names and I used

585
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Larry Rosen:>to laugh at him.

586
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, but in terms of the of

587
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Larry Rosen:>the general goals and objectives of open

588
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Larry Rosen:>source, even though Richard was definitely not

589
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Larry Rosen:>a part of OSI, refused.

590
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Larry Rosen:>OSI, quite frankly, didn't want to be

591
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Larry Rosen:>a part of OSI, thought that their

592
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:10.220
<v Larry Rosen:>philosophy was too liberal, too open, and

593
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.300
<v Larry Rosen:>that there were certain kinds of interactions

594
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:20.030
<v Larry Rosen:>that Ozai sought out with commercial companies

595
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.510
<v Larry Rosen:>that Richard Stallman and the Free Software

596
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:28.310
<v Larry Rosen:>Foundation didn't like, didn't share.

597
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.280
<v Larry Rosen:>And so even though I was able

598
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.470
<v Larry Rosen:>to talk to them and become friendly

599
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.430
<v Larry Rosen:>with them, it was clear that Ozai

600
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.110
<v Larry Rosen:>was something different.

601
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:48.260
<v Larry Rosen:>Ozai was a commercially friendly, open source

602
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Larry Rosen:>organization, and that they wanted to develop

603
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.810
<v Larry Rosen:>licenses and support structures that would help

604
00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:01.640
<v Larry Rosen:>commercial companies build software that was open

605
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.330
<v Larry Rosen:>source.

606
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:07.050
<v Larry Rosen:>This was something that was foreign to

607
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.160
<v Larry Rosen:>Richard Stallman.

608
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.729
<v Larry Rosen:>He cared not at all about the

609
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.410
<v Larry Rosen:>commercial businesses.

610
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.720
<v Larry Rosen:>He cared not at all about trying

611
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.030
<v Larry Rosen:>to make life easier for them.

612
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Larry Rosen:>And I found that, um.

613
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.230
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't know, because perhaps I'm more

614
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.940
<v Larry Rosen:>liberal than socialist at the time.

615
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Larry Rosen:>I felt that he was going too

616
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.320
<v Larry Rosen:>far.

617
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.110
<v Larry Rosen:>That in particular, his lawyer was going

618
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.399
<v Larry Rosen:>too far and saying things like, open

619
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.850
<v Larry Rosen:>source licenses are not contracts, they're just

620
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.290
<v Larry Rosen:>copyrights.

621
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.130
<v Larry Rosen:>And I said, it's not how I

622
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.120
<v Larry Rosen:>learned it.

623
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.030
<v Larry Rosen:>That's not what I understood.

624
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.740
<v Larry Rosen:>And I began to work with companies

625
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.360
<v Larry Rosen:>through OSI to help them to develop

626
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.260
<v Larry Rosen:>their own licenses.

627
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.459
<v Larry Rosen:>I would have companies that would, and

628
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.040
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm not going to mention specific companies.

629
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.900
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't think that would be appropriate.

630
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.400
<v Larry Rosen:>But companies that said, uh, we want

631
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.409
<v Larry Rosen:>to develop licenses that are different from

632
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.720
<v Larry Rosen:>OCI, uh, different from Free Software Foundation,

633
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.120
<v Larry Rosen:>that that were friendlier to open source

634
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.750
<v Larry Rosen:>without being, um, restrictive in the kinds

635
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:45.040
<v Larry Rosen:>of licensing and development activities that they

636
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.640
<v Larry Rosen:>would support.

637
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.200
<v Larry Rosen:>And so my efforts were on the

638
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.340
<v Larry Rosen:>outside of Free Software Foundation, not the

639
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.590
<v Larry Rosen:>inside of Free Software Foundation.

640
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.649
<v Larry Rosen:>They were on the inside of OSI

641
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Larry Rosen:>trying to Ignore their gun rhetoric and

642
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.550
<v Larry Rosen:>their second amendment bullshit.

643
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:12.509
<v Larry Rosen:>And sorry, a little bit of politics

644
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.290
<v Larry Rosen:>is allowed, I presume on this thing,

645
00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:21.389
<v Larry Rosen:>and to work to have them work

646
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:27.989
<v Larry Rosen:>with developers and with software companies and

647
00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:37.920
<v Larry Rosen:>with, uh, um, application, uh, opportunities that

648
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.900
<v Larry Rosen:>were not quite free.

649
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:46.110
<v Larry Rosen:>Software Foundation GPL activities.

650
00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:50.429
<v Larry Rosen:>And while I was still friendly with

651
00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.359
<v Larry Rosen:>the Free Software Foundation and friendly with

652
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.570
<v Larry Rosen:>the people, I tried not to be

653
00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.839
<v Larry Rosen:>too biased or too bigoted about certain

654
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.780
<v Larry Rosen:>things.

655
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:06.520
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, they they did not support what

656
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.330
<v Larry Rosen:>I did.

657
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.000
<v Larry Rosen:>They did not like the fact that

658
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Larry Rosen:>I was being supportive of what was

659
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.280
<v Larry Rosen:>the open source definition that you're familiar

660
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:24.009
<v Larry Rosen:>with, that they had a different philosophy,

661
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.950
<v Larry Rosen:>and I shared their philosophy more than

662
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.860
<v Larry Rosen:>I shared the Free Software Foundation.

663
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.450
<v Larry Rosen:>So I was kind of in a,

664
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.910
<v Larry Rosen:>in a two worlds situation trying to

665
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.760
<v Larry Rosen:>balance, excuse me, trying to balance my

666
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:53.560
<v Larry Rosen:>social work for software companies while also

667
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.690
<v Larry Rosen:>developing my social work for developers so

668
00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.740
<v Larry Rosen:>that developers could take advantage of the

669
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.170
<v Larry Rosen:>opportunities of free software.

670
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.680
<v Larry Rosen:>Little coffee always helps.

671
00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:20.149
<v Larry Rosen:>So I worked with them for several

672
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:27.650
<v Larry Rosen:>years and developed licenses for the companies

673
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:34.340
<v Larry Rosen:>that supported OSI, and also developed a

674
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.440
<v Larry Rosen:>license for OSI itself that would make

675
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.380
<v Larry Rosen:>the OSI board of directors comfortable with

676
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:52.279
<v Larry Rosen:>a license that that was phrased differently

677
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.930
<v Larry Rosen:>from the GPL.

678
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.010
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

679
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.630
<v Karen Herman:>How is it different?

680
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:06.160
<v Larry Rosen:>The GPL is a strong copyright oriented

681
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Larry Rosen:>license that wanted very much to prevent

682
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:17.110
<v Larry Rosen:>companies from developing software that could compete

683
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.120
<v Larry Rosen:>with GPL software.

684
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:25.570
<v Larry Rosen:>So one of the facets of their

685
00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.990
<v Larry Rosen:>license, which quite frankly, I didn't read

686
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.030
<v Larry Rosen:>the same way, but they had this

687
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Larry Rosen:>Columbia professor who had his own attitude

688
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.980
<v Larry Rosen:>that it was a license that they

689
00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.339
<v Larry Rosen:>felt did not allow commercial.

690
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:57.320
<v Larry Rosen:>Successfully commercial development that companies could not

691
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:03.859
<v Larry Rosen:>develop software that sold, that made money.

692
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.150
<v Larry Rosen:>That competed with GPL software.

693
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.370
<v Larry Rosen:>That absence of competition bothered me.

694
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Larry Rosen:>I didn't understand why they had to

695
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.230
<v Larry Rosen:>restrict companies from developing commercially successful software.

696
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.360
<v Larry Rosen:>That it was not fair to programmers

697
00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.400
<v Larry Rosen:>who needed to make a living.

698
00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.470
<v Larry Rosen:>And so I would develop licenses that

699
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:47.540
<v Larry Rosen:>were supportive in some sense of commercial

700
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.560
<v Larry Rosen:>development.

701
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.750
<v Larry Rosen:>Examples of in today's world are like

702
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.960
<v Larry Rosen:>the Mozilla license and.

703
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:06.900
<v Larry Rosen:>And licenses that authorized the development of

704
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.660
<v Larry Rosen:>derivative works that were competitive with open

705
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.470
<v Larry Rosen:>source.

706
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.120
<v Larry Rosen:>And not everyone agreed with that, but

707
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Larry Rosen:>not everyone disagreed with that.

708
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:26.940
<v Larry Rosen:>So Osai was more supportive of the

709
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.319
<v Larry Rosen:>development of derivative works that were competitive

710
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.160
<v Larry Rosen:>with open source, with Free Software Foundation

711
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.750
<v Larry Rosen:>and Free Software Foundation to this day

712
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:47.279
<v Larry Rosen:>has more of a let's control it.

713
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Larry Rosen:>Let's prevent the development of derivative works

714
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:58.440
<v Larry Rosen:>that can compete with us because they'll

715
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Larry Rosen:>make money and we won't.

716
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.860
<v Larry Rosen:>They'll have successes that we want.

717
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.640
<v Larry Rosen:>And it's just they were different.

718
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.180
<v Larry Rosen:>It wasn't that there was a war

719
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Larry Rosen:>going on.

720
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.290
<v Larry Rosen:>It's just that they had a different

721
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:28.680
<v Larry Rosen:>basis for understanding what what open source

722
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.450
<v Larry Rosen:>software was all about.

723
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.140
<v Larry Rosen:>I thought open source was more for

724
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.640
<v Larry Rosen:>the engineer to develop software, to make

725
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Larry Rosen:>it free, to have it be available,

726
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:47.550
<v Larry Rosen:>and to form companies that would sell

727
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.630
<v Larry Rosen:>and make a profit and fund They're

728
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.069
<v Larry Rosen:>engineers.

729
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:58.529
<v Larry Rosen:>And whereas to this day there are

730
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.890
<v Larry Rosen:>various parts of the Free Software Foundation

731
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:05.009
<v Larry Rosen:>that believe that that's not what it's

732
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:11.220
<v Larry Rosen:>about, that it's about giving software, creating

733
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.410
<v Larry Rosen:>software that is always free, even when

734
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Larry Rosen:>a derivative work is created.

735
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.360
<v Larry Rosen:>And I, I couldn't I couldn't buy

736
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.110
<v Larry Rosen:>that.

737
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.260
<v Larry Rosen:>I just didn't think that it was

738
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.140
<v Larry Rosen:>fair to engineers.

739
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.330
<v Larry Rosen:>You know, I'm one of many and

740
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.340
<v Larry Rosen:>not everyone agreed with me.

741
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Larry Rosen:>And not everyone agrees with me today.

742
00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:50.860
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, there are still difficult The differences.

743
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.950
<v Larry Rosen:>And in fact, one of the reasons

744
00:41:53.950 --> 00:42:00.670
<v Larry Rosen:>I left OSI was because they were

745
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.790
<v Larry Rosen:>too strong in that way.

746
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.490
<v Larry Rosen:>They were.

747
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.720
<v Larry Rosen:>Unwilling to find a compromise to the

748
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.970
<v Larry Rosen:>people that they threatened with their guns,

749
00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:20.049
<v Larry Rosen:>or that they threatened with their software

750
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.250
<v Larry Rosen:>development philosophies, and that there were people

751
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.980
<v Larry Rosen:>in the free software community, that and

752
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.920
<v Larry Rosen:>the open source software community that didn't

753
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.560
<v Larry Rosen:>want to play that restrictive game.

754
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.050
<v Larry Rosen:>And I didn't either.

755
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.100
<v Larry Rosen:>So I ultimately left.

756
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.109
<v Larry Rosen:>And what I did was I wrote

757
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.129
<v Larry Rosen:>a book.

758
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.049
<v Karen Herman:>Talk about that.

759
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.970
<v Karen Herman:>That was a it was a 2020

760
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.680
<v Karen Herman:>and 22,004.

761
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.940
<v Karen Herman:>You wrote this book?

762
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.960
<v Larry Rosen:>Yes.

763
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:04.320
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, I wanted to say what I

764
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:11.550
<v Larry Rosen:>thought were the core issues of copyright

765
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:16.350
<v Larry Rosen:>law and contract law with respect to

766
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.370
<v Larry Rosen:>software and with respect to open source,

767
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:29.460
<v Larry Rosen:>that by describing the differences between the

768
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.750
<v Larry Rosen:>various kinds of licenses, I would be

769
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.710
<v Larry Rosen:>able to explain why someone might choose

770
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.790
<v Larry Rosen:>one license over another, why they might

771
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.180
<v Larry Rosen:>choose my license, for example, which allowed

772
00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:49.299
<v Larry Rosen:>derivative works under certain circumstances, as opposed

773
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.960
<v Larry Rosen:>to the Free Software Foundation GPL, which

774
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.450
<v Larry Rosen:>claimed it wasn't even a contract, that

775
00:43:58.450 --> 00:43:59.710
<v Larry Rosen:>it was just copyright.

776
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.450
<v Larry Rosen:>And we don't want we don't want

777
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.500
<v Larry Rosen:>derivative works.

778
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Larry Rosen:>So I decided to write a book

779
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.870
<v Larry Rosen:>that explained the law.

780
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Larry Rosen:>That was more a function of what

781
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.750
<v Larry Rosen:>the law would say than what these

782
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:27.459
<v Larry Rosen:>politically directed organizations would say.

783
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:33.910
<v Larry Rosen:>And that was not always popular.

784
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.160
<v Larry Rosen:>So there were a couple of people

785
00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.350
<v Larry Rosen:>on the open source board who found

786
00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:49.250
<v Larry Rosen:>that Unattractive and I didn't need them

787
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.860
<v Larry Rosen:>and they didn't need me, so I.

788
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:57.680
<v Larry Rosen:>So I left Ozzie and tried to

789
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Larry Rosen:>figure out how to reintegrate Ozzie into

790
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.050
<v Larry Rosen:>the software community.

791
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.440
<v Larry Rosen:>I worked with various people about, you

792
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.290
<v Larry Rosen:>know, what can we do to reorganize

793
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.580
<v Larry Rosen:>Ozzie, to reorganize Free Software Foundation?

794
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.140
<v Larry Rosen:>What can we do to keep them

795
00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:25.430
<v Larry Rosen:>from being antagonistic to each other?

796
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.180
<v Larry Rosen:>And it turns out that that was

797
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:35.390
<v Larry Rosen:>not a very popular motive, that O.s.i

798
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:41.390
<v Larry Rosen:>was successful and the Free Software Foundation

799
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:46.330
<v Larry Rosen:>was Successful, and there wasn't a great

800
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:50.080
<v Larry Rosen:>deal of interest in trying to merge

801
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.740
<v Larry Rosen:>them or combine them, or try to

802
00:45:54.940 --> 00:46:01.480
<v Larry Rosen:>develop a consistent philosophy that would result

803
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.250
<v Larry Rosen:>in open source software that allowed derivative

804
00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.070
<v Larry Rosen:>works without being too competitive.

805
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.560
<v Larry Rosen:>It just it was not a possibility.

806
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:17.920
<v Larry Rosen:>It just Ozzie was not all in

807
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.940
<v Larry Rosen:>favor of it.

808
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.700
<v Larry Rosen:>And some were free software.

809
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.460
<v Larry Rosen:>People were not all in favor of

810
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.590
<v Larry Rosen:>it, but some were.

811
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.000
<v Larry Rosen:>And I was there in the middle.

812
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.430
<v Larry Rosen:>You know who's Larry Rosen?

813
00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.430
<v Larry Rosen:>What in the world does he have

814
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.020
<v Larry Rosen:>to say with all of this?

815
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.420
<v Larry Rosen:>He's just a he's just a programmer

816
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.980
<v Larry Rosen:>who became a lawyer.

817
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:53.390
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, so I left Ozzie and

818
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:58.819
<v Larry Rosen:>I became a member of Apache.

819
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.910
<v Larry Rosen:>Which had a different philosophy, a very

820
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:09.710
<v Larry Rosen:>open philosophy, a very a philosophy where

821
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.370
<v Larry Rosen:>software could be developed into derivative works.

822
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:17.960
<v Larry Rosen:>And they had companies like IBM and

823
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.270
<v Larry Rosen:>even Google to some degree, supporting them

824
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:28.250
<v Larry Rosen:>in the development of their open source

825
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.600
<v Larry Rosen:>model.

826
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.650
<v Larry Rosen:>And I felt very good about that.

827
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.990
<v Larry Rosen:>And I eventually got elected to the

828
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:41.910
<v Larry Rosen:>board of OSA, of of Apache in

829
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:45.899
<v Larry Rosen:>support of the kinds of things that

830
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.880
<v Larry Rosen:>I described to you a few minutes

831
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.540
<v Larry Rosen:>ago.

832
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Larry Rosen:>And that is, there were certain things,

833
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:01.170
<v Larry Rosen:>certain aspects of OSI, of I'm sorry,

834
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Larry Rosen:>of Apache that really rankled on me.

835
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.710
<v Larry Rosen:>Still do.

836
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.050
<v Larry Rosen:>I think they have a kind of

837
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.710
<v Larry Rosen:>a religious attitude toward software, toward their

838
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.390
<v Larry Rosen:>development model.

839
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.740
<v Larry Rosen:>I think they wake up every morning

840
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.840
<v Larry Rosen:>and say religious prayers to the Apache

841
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Larry Rosen:>model, and I'm not religious, so I

842
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.210
<v Larry Rosen:>found that uncomfortable.

843
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Larry Rosen:>And I said to them, and I

844
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Larry Rosen:>tried from my position on the board

845
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:52.750
<v Larry Rosen:>to influence other members of the board

846
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.359
<v Larry Rosen:>and members of the Apache Foundation.

847
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Larry Rosen:>Can we find some way to combine

848
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.060
<v Larry Rosen:>our forces with the Free Software Foundation?

849
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.990
<v Larry Rosen:>For example, if we're going to develop

850
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:14.440
<v Larry Rosen:>a competitive product to Microsoft Word and

851
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Larry Rosen:>they're developing a competitive product of Microsoft

852
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Larry Rosen:>Word.

853
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.940
<v Larry Rosen:>Two competitors to Microsoft Word doesn't make

854
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Larry Rosen:>sense.

855
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.760
<v Larry Rosen:>It just you're wasting software effort.

856
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Larry Rosen:>You're developing software that you can't use

857
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Larry Rosen:>their software and they won't use your

858
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.220
<v Larry Rosen:>software.

859
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.120
<v Larry Rosen:>So we got two teams, each of

860
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.850
<v Larry Rosen:>whom wakes up in the morning and

861
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.660
<v Larry Rosen:>makes their prayers to whatever God of

862
00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.940
<v Larry Rosen:>open source they have and and won't

863
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.140
<v Larry Rosen:>work together.

864
00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:55.650
<v Larry Rosen:>Won't.

865
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.450
<v Larry Rosen:>Won't help.

866
00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Larry Rosen:>Open source.

867
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.500
<v Larry Rosen:>So I ended up leaving the Apache

868
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.040
<v Larry Rosen:>board.

869
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.580
<v Larry Rosen:>I just I couldn't I couldn't support

870
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Larry Rosen:>the separateness of these two organizations where

871
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.440
<v Larry Rosen:>the people in the Apache Foundation would

872
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.790
<v Larry Rosen:>not accept any software licensed under the

873
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:30.000
<v Larry Rosen:>GPL, and the Free Software Foundation would

874
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.170
<v Larry Rosen:>not accept software developed under the Apache

875
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.990
<v Larry Rosen:>license.

876
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:43.900
<v Larry Rosen:>So Y2Y.

877
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:46.840
<v Larry Rosen:>What is it that we can't find?

878
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.850
<v Larry Rosen:>Some sort of a basis for cooperation.

879
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Larry Rosen:>I couldn't do it.

880
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.790
<v Larry Rosen:>They never did.

881
00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.700
<v Larry Rosen:>They still wake every morning with their

882
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:06.129
<v Larry Rosen:>prayers and still develop software in their

883
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.300
<v Larry Rosen:>own way.

884
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.880
<v Larry Rosen:>And I just.

885
00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.600
<v Larry Rosen:>It just didn't make sense to me.

886
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.280
<v Larry Rosen:>I continued, obviously, to work with companies.

887
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Larry Rosen:>I had clients that wanted one license

888
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.149
<v Larry Rosen:>or another, and I found that OSI,

889
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.020
<v Larry Rosen:>the Free Software Foundation, worked very hard

890
00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Larry Rosen:>to develop GPL.

891
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Larry Rosen:>Number two, the successor license to the

892
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.279
<v Larry Rosen:>GPL.

893
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Larry Rosen:>And I worked on their committee and

894
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Larry Rosen:>I helped as much as I could

895
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.160
<v Larry Rosen:>there.

896
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Larry Rosen:>And meanwhile, OSI started accepting licenses from

897
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.910
<v Larry Rosen:>everyone who wanted to write a license.

898
00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Larry Rosen:>People who weren't lawyers.

899
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Larry Rosen:>People who were lawyers.

900
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Larry Rosen:>People who were lawyers and didn't know

901
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Larry Rosen:>the law.

902
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, and I just they kept saying,

903
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Larry Rosen:>well, we don't want your license, so

904
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.029
<v Larry Rosen:>we'll go with others.

905
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Larry Rosen:>And some are better than others.

906
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.600
<v Larry Rosen:>And it's true, every every lawyer is

907
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Larry Rosen:>like me and has an ego and

908
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.839
<v Larry Rosen:>loves the words that we develop in

909
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.100
<v Larry Rosen:>our licenses.

910
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:36.310
<v Larry Rosen:>And once our license to be the,

911
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.009
<v Larry Rosen:>you know, the one that God speaks.

912
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.020
<v Larry Rosen:>But after a while, Ozzy had too

913
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.640
<v Larry Rosen:>many licenses.

914
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.250
<v Larry Rosen:>They still have too many licenses.

915
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.380
<v Larry Rosen:>They've become a little bit better at

916
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:50.560
<v Larry Rosen:>it.

917
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.710
<v Larry Rosen:>They now say you have to get

918
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.890
<v Larry Rosen:>an approval by a lawyer before you

919
00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.190
<v Larry Rosen:>can submit a license for Ozzy approval,

920
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.500
<v Larry Rosen:>but there's still 100 licenses.

921
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.129
<v Larry Rosen:>And, you know, a software company wants

922
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.300
<v Larry Rosen:>to develop software.

923
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:11.109
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, what license do they use?

924
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.390
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, you know, from my perspective, they

925
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.040
<v Larry Rosen:>should use my license.

926
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.799
<v Larry Rosen:>It's the best one ever written.

927
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.900
<v Larry Rosen:>It's law.

928
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Larry Rosen:>It's language is perfectly clear.

929
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.560
<v Larry Rosen:>That isn't that isn't their attitude, that

930
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.660
<v Larry Rosen:>isn't the way they deal with it.

931
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:34.520
<v Larry Rosen:>And they're free.

932
00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:38.569
<v Larry Rosen:>I mean, I like my licenses.

933
00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.310
<v Larry Rosen:>They like their licenses.

934
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.630
<v Larry Rosen:>They're allowed.

935
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.720
<v Larry Rosen:>Lawyers have different opinions.

936
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.390
<v Larry Rosen:>We even have lawyers on the Supreme

937
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.340
<v Larry Rosen:>Court that have opinions.

938
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.410
<v Larry Rosen:>Um.

939
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.339
<v Larry Rosen:>But but I found it.

940
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.420
<v Larry Rosen:>I just I couldn't keep doing it.

941
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:12.830
<v Larry Rosen:>I just couldn't help one versus the

942
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:13.819
<v Larry Rosen:>other.

943
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:19.370
<v Larry Rosen:>When they refuse to work together, when

944
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:23.840
<v Larry Rosen:>when the objectives of these two organizations

945
00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Larry Rosen:>became something other than great software.

946
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Larry Rosen:>That's what the objective is here.

947
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Larry Rosen:>Software that maybe everyone can use, maybe

948
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Larry Rosen:>more people can use.

949
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Larry Rosen:>Maybe there are different versions of software

950
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Larry Rosen:>that have features or functions that are

951
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Larry Rosen:>better than others.

952
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Larry Rosen:>And if it's the issue of cooperation

953
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:03.000
<v Larry Rosen:>that I just couldn't I couldn't deal

954
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.419
<v Larry Rosen:>with it.

955
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.149
<v Larry Rosen:>I just I said, I'm too old.

956
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm too tired of doing this kind

957
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:16.170
<v Larry Rosen:>of getting people to be friendly to

958
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.080
<v Larry Rosen:>each other, getting people to be not

959
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Larry Rosen:>afraid that they're going to be shot

960
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Larry Rosen:>by gun nuts.

961
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:29.209
<v Larry Rosen:>I just, Uh, it it didn't make

962
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.870
<v Larry Rosen:>me happy anymore, and I didn't need

963
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.040
<v Larry Rosen:>to do it.

964
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:41.240
<v Larry Rosen:>I think that open source software is

965
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.229
<v Larry Rosen:>still.

966
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:50.450
<v Larry Rosen:>A great idea, a great solution to

967
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.130
<v Larry Rosen:>the problem of a commercial lock away

968
00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:00.680
<v Larry Rosen:>to the problem of private.

969
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:09.950
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, advantage for commercial companies over the

970
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.130
<v Larry Rosen:>software engineers who are trying to do

971
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.330
<v Larry Rosen:>good stuff.

972
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.660
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm all in favor of that.

973
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.650
<v Larry Rosen:>I like GPL people.

974
00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.600
<v Larry Rosen:>I like Apache People.

975
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:31.350
<v Larry Rosen:>I like both organizations, not just those

976
00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.230
<v Larry Rosen:>organizations, but there are others, you know,

977
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:38.430
<v Larry Rosen:>Mozilla and others that are have their

978
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.720
<v Larry Rosen:>own philosophies.

979
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.390
<v Larry Rosen:>I like them all because the fundamental

980
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.470
<v Larry Rosen:>objective that they have is good software

981
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:53.220
<v Larry Rosen:>that's open and free.

982
00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.640
<v Larry Rosen:>But not entirely.

983
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.850
<v Larry Rosen:>And and as such, it just it

984
00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:07.200
<v Larry Rosen:>rankled me.

985
00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:13.500
<v Larry Rosen:>It got me feeling like I was.

986
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.880
<v Larry Rosen:>Hurting the software community.

987
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Larry Rosen:>I was not helping people anymore.

988
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Larry Rosen:>It's okay.

989
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't have to.

990
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Larry Rosen:>They don't need me.

991
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:35.710
<v Larry Rosen:>Um.

992
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Larry Rosen:>You know, I even had some differences

993
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.620
<v Larry Rosen:>over the open source definition.

994
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Karen Herman:>Which was what?

995
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Larry Rosen:>Too long?

996
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.550
<v Larry Rosen:>Too many clauses.

997
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Larry Rosen:>What I ended up doing is writing

998
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:03.640
<v Larry Rosen:>my book, in which I summarize the

999
00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Larry Rosen:>open source definition in five clauses, rather

1000
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Larry Rosen:>than ten clauses.

1001
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Larry Rosen:>But, you know, I'm not going to

1002
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.400
<v Larry Rosen:>change their ways.

1003
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.420
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm not going to cause them to

1004
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:24.360
<v Larry Rosen:>erase five of their clauses or combine

1005
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Larry Rosen:>them in some way.

1006
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:29.069
<v Larry Rosen:>Those people are friends of mine, I

1007
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.799
<v Larry Rosen:>like them, I know their hearts are

1008
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.370
<v Larry Rosen:>in the right place, and I'm not

1009
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Larry Rosen:>the only writer in the world.

1010
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.010
<v Larry Rosen:>So yes.

1011
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.259
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, so did the book when when

1012
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.210
<v Karen Herman:>the book came out, did people, you

1013
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Karen Herman:>know, have very, um, opinion, opinions of

1014
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.400
<v Karen Herman:>it strongly?

1015
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.750
<v Larry Rosen:>Actually, yes.

1016
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:53.490
<v Larry Rosen:>I was quite surprised.

1017
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Larry Rosen:>I was very pleased that Larry Lessig,

1018
00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:02.430
<v Larry Rosen:>professor of law now at Harvard, was

1019
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:06.240
<v Larry Rosen:>quite generous in his comments about it,

1020
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.810
<v Larry Rosen:>about what I said and how I

1021
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:10.740
<v Larry Rosen:>said it.

1022
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.580
<v Larry Rosen:>There are still people who use it,

1023
00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:18.420
<v Larry Rosen:>although it's no longer in print, and

1024
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Larry Rosen:>it talks about licenses that have been

1025
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.660
<v Larry Rosen:>surpassed and replaced.

1026
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.110
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, I've been asked to come up

1027
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.790
<v Larry Rosen:>with a new version of the book

1028
00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:34.210
<v Larry Rosen:>and no, not needed.

1029
00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:38.589
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, but yes, it was successful.

1030
00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:42.940
<v Larry Rosen:>I think it did stimulate people to

1031
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:48.220
<v Larry Rosen:>think about what open source licenses are.

1032
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.710
<v Larry Rosen:>It did stimulate people to write their

1033
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:54.550
<v Larry Rosen:>own licenses for whatever their reasons would

1034
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:55.300
<v Larry Rosen:>be.

1035
00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Larry Rosen:>But, um, so I think it was

1036
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.940
<v Larry Rosen:>a success.

1037
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.110
<v Larry Rosen:>You know, that's life.

1038
01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.720
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1039
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:14.350
<v Karen Herman:>Um, how are you doing?

1040
01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.070
<v Karen Herman:>Do you need to take a break

1041
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.030
<v Karen Herman:>or anything or.

1042
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Larry Rosen:>Ask your question again.

1043
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, I just asked you if you

1044
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.390
<v Karen Herman:>needed to take a break.

1045
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.320
<v Karen Herman:>Or are you?

1046
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.259
<v Larry Rosen:>I have nothing more to add.

1047
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:34.430
<v Karen Herman:>All right.

1048
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Karen Herman:>All right.

1049
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:40.310
<v Larry Rosen:>So I think I've expressed myself in

1050
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Larry Rosen:>ways that are.

1051
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Larry Rosen:>Perhaps too candid.

1052
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.310
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, I've not been a shy person

1053
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.720
<v Larry Rosen:>most of my life.

1054
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Larry Rosen:>I do have opinions about things.

1055
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.859
<v Larry Rosen:>Yeah, so does everyone.

1056
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:06.290
<v Larry Rosen:>And, um, I'm willing to stand by

1057
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.250
<v Larry Rosen:>them until someone proves to me that,

1058
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.930
<v Larry Rosen:>uh, they're the wrong opinions.

1059
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.140
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1060
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.650
<v Karen Herman:>So?

1061
01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.230
<v Karen Herman:>So were you involved in any litigation

1062
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.520
<v Karen Herman:>on these?

1063
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:21.510
<v Larry Rosen:>Oh, yeah.

1064
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.440
<v Larry Rosen:>Over the years.

1065
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.879
<v Larry Rosen:>I mean, I've been an attorney for

1066
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.050
<v Larry Rosen:>30 years now, and I've represented many

1067
01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:31.379
<v Larry Rosen:>companies, including some of the larger ones,

1068
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.540
<v Larry Rosen:>some of the smaller ones, some of

1069
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.450
<v Larry Rosen:>the successful ones, some of the failures.

1070
01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:39.810
<v Larry Rosen:>I've represented individual programmers.

1071
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:44.040
<v Larry Rosen:>I've represented companies that have done shit

1072
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:47.520
<v Larry Rosen:>things to their programmers, and companies that

1073
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.129
<v Larry Rosen:>have done good things to their programmers.

1074
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.980
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, yeah, I've had a success, what

1075
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:58.560
<v Larry Rosen:>I consider to be a successful legal

1076
01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.549
<v Larry Rosen:>career.

1077
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:07.950
<v Larry Rosen:>I, uh, there were many opportunities during

1078
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:12.180
<v Larry Rosen:>that career for me to sign on

1079
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Larry Rosen:>to other Law firms or other companies,

1080
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.640
<v Larry Rosen:>and it just never worked out.

1081
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.839
<v Larry Rosen:>It never felt right.

1082
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.540
<v Larry Rosen:>And so I've not become rich and

1083
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.610
<v Larry Rosen:>I struggle to pay my mortgage every

1084
01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:26.180
<v Larry Rosen:>month.

1085
01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:31.160
<v Larry Rosen:>And, you know, the but I have

1086
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.049
<v Larry Rosen:>a nice place to live.

1087
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:37.279
<v Larry Rosen:>I live on 158 acre ranch.

1088
01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.800
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, I'm now involved.

1089
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.779
<v Larry Rosen:>Although I don't do anything with it,

1090
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.779
<v Larry Rosen:>I let it do its thing in

1091
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.230
<v Larry Rosen:>the cannabis industry in Mendocino County.

1092
01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:54.890
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't use it, but, you know,

1093
01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:56.240
<v Larry Rosen:>it's good stuff.

1094
01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:01.490
<v Larry Rosen:>So yes, I'm satisfied with my life,

1095
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:04.819
<v Larry Rosen:>with what I've done with the companies

1096
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.770
<v Larry Rosen:>I've helped and the company and the

1097
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:10.700
<v Larry Rosen:>individuals and programmers I've helped.

1098
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.839
<v Larry Rosen:>I have no regrets.

1099
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Larry Rosen:>Going to law school was a good

1100
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Larry Rosen:>decision.

1101
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:27.180
<v Larry Rosen:>I could probably have made more money

1102
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Larry Rosen:>doing software.

1103
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.820
<v Larry Rosen:>Writing software, managing software companies and so

1104
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.090
<v Larry Rosen:>on.

1105
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Larry Rosen:>But money isn't everything.

1106
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1107
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Karen Herman:>How do you how do you think

1108
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.339
<v Karen Herman:>the open source has changed since you

1109
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Karen Herman:>got into it?

1110
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.859
<v Larry Rosen:>I think it's been a success.

1111
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Larry Rosen:>An enormous.

1112
01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Larry Rosen:>Excuse me?

1113
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Larry Rosen:>An enormous success.

1114
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Larry Rosen:>That's something on which I take great

1115
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:08.279
<v Larry Rosen:>pride, because I think that I have

1116
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.120
<v Larry Rosen:>contributed in many ways to the success

1117
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.410
<v Larry Rosen:>of open source.

1118
01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.550
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm watching now as people are arguing

1119
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:22.779
<v Larry Rosen:>about artificial intelligence, and somehow or another

1120
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.529
<v Larry Rosen:>it's going to be the the replacement

1121
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.720
<v Larry Rosen:>for open source in some way.

1122
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.880
<v Larry Rosen:>And maybe it will, I don't know,

1123
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Larry Rosen:>I it's beyond me.

1124
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.070
<v Larry Rosen:>It's not my field.

1125
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.690
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, but I think open source has

1126
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:46.299
<v Larry Rosen:>been an enormous, enormous success.

1127
01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.790
<v Larry Rosen:>It's as successful in Europe.

1128
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:53.020
<v Larry Rosen:>It's successful in Asia, in Africa, in

1129
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.970
<v Larry Rosen:>the United States.

1130
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.710
<v Larry Rosen:>It's had this flurry of licenses that

1131
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:05.229
<v Larry Rosen:>have been developed by people who have

1132
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Larry Rosen:>tried to improve it over the years

1133
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Larry Rosen:>and add features and add opportunities and

1134
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.890
<v Larry Rosen:>make life better for engineers.

1135
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.529
<v Larry Rosen:>I think that's a great success and

1136
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.760
<v Larry Rosen:>I suppose.

1137
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:34.170
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, I want to accept a some

1138
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.910
<v Larry Rosen:>credit for that.

1139
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.840
<v Larry Rosen:>I want to accept some credit for

1140
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.509
<v Larry Rosen:>having made good friends, for having not

1141
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:48.780
<v Larry Rosen:>made as many enemies as I've made

1142
01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.830
<v Larry Rosen:>friends.

1143
01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:54.959
<v Larry Rosen:>I think open source is here for

1144
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.190
<v Larry Rosen:>good for forever.

1145
01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:04.560
<v Larry Rosen:>It's there's no way of undoing it.

1146
01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Larry Rosen:>There's no reason to undo it.

1147
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.330
<v Larry Rosen:>There are enough people who are in

1148
01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Larry Rosen:>favor of it who like it to

1149
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Larry Rosen:>benefit from it, that I'm proud.

1150
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Larry Rosen:>I sit back in my chair with

1151
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Larry Rosen:>pride at having helped to convert to

1152
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Larry Rosen:>something that is new and good and

1153
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.910
<v Larry Rosen:>beneficial.

1154
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:42.129
<v Larry Rosen:>It's got it's, you know, the people

1155
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Larry Rosen:>who make their prayers every morning.

1156
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, it's it's like any human activity.

1157
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.870
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm pleased with the way it's

1158
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:00.069
<v Larry Rosen:>developed.

1159
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:07.820
<v Larry Rosen:>I was reading some blurb in Google

1160
01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:13.670
<v Larry Rosen:>News about how the former president of

1161
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.839
<v Larry Rosen:>Microsoft used to say that open source

1162
01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:23.660
<v Larry Rosen:>was communistic and was going to destroy

1163
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.370
<v Larry Rosen:>the software industry.

1164
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.940
<v Larry Rosen:>And so he was wrong.

1165
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.060
<v Larry Rosen:>He was wrong.

1166
01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.060
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm proud of that.

1167
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.940
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm proud that I was able to

1168
01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.850
<v Larry Rosen:>to have some influence over that.

1169
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.440
<v Larry Rosen:>Not total.

1170
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:53.299
<v Larry Rosen:>Maybe not even permanent, but open source

1171
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:54.740
<v Larry Rosen:>is here for good.

1172
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:57.740
<v Larry Rosen:>It's here.

1173
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.230
<v Karen Herman:>What about in other fields?

1174
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:02.120
<v Karen Herman:>Have you seen it being adopted in

1175
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Karen Herman:>other fields and other technologies.

1176
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, the one that I have seen

1177
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:14.530
<v Larry Rosen:>that I really appreciate is the scientific

1178
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.580
<v Larry Rosen:>community.

1179
01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.729
<v Larry Rosen:>I in my spare time, when I'm

1180
01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:25.540
<v Larry Rosen:>not thinking about open source law, I'm

1181
01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.340
<v Larry Rosen:>thinking about physics.

1182
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.100
<v Larry Rosen:>And I read a lot of things

1183
01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.910
<v Larry Rosen:>in the physics journals and and so

1184
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:34.300
<v Larry Rosen:>on.

1185
01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.600
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm noticing that more and more

1186
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:47.410
<v Larry Rosen:>of them are adopting open source principles

1187
01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Larry Rosen:>that when a scientist publishes his publication,

1188
01:08:55.870 --> 01:09:01.420
<v Larry Rosen:>ought not to be, uh, secret, ought

1189
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Larry Rosen:>not to be under a license that

1190
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Larry Rosen:>prevents the sharing of that information.

1191
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm most pleased that the scientific

1192
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Larry Rosen:>community has accepted open source philosophy with

1193
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Larry Rosen:>respect to their own studies, their own

1194
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Larry Rosen:>writings, their own developments.

1195
01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:35.240
<v Larry Rosen:>That it's not a question of keeping

1196
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Larry Rosen:>it secret so that they can make

1197
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Larry Rosen:>a profit.

1198
01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.790
<v Larry Rosen:>I don't care if they earn their

1199
01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:44.689
<v Larry Rosen:>Nobel Prizes and get their private benefits

1200
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Larry Rosen:>from, you know, awards and so on.

1201
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Larry Rosen:>So long as the, the, the, the

1202
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Larry Rosen:>thought processes that go into the creation

1203
01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.650
<v Larry Rosen:>of works that humans can use.

1204
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Larry Rosen:>Is free is available.

1205
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.570
<v Larry Rosen:>So in terms of to answer your

1206
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:14.460
<v Larry Rosen:>question, I, I think that's the greatest

1207
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.559
<v Larry Rosen:>opportunity that's happened.

1208
01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:21.240
<v Larry Rosen:>Science has become freer.

1209
01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:24.690
<v Larry Rosen:>Um.

1210
01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:29.310
<v Larry Rosen:>I think that's a benefit.

1211
01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.260
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah, that's a great insight too.

1212
01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:32.400
<v Karen Herman:>It really is.

1213
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.500
<v Karen Herman:>Anything else before we before we conclude,

1214
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.910
<v Karen Herman:>is there anything else you'd like to

1215
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.960
<v Karen Herman:>to talk about a little bit about

1216
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.590
<v Karen Herman:>your personal life and or, you know,

1217
01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.940
<v Karen Herman:>what's you're up to now?

1218
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.330
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, like I said, what I'm up

1219
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.059
<v Larry Rosen:>to now is, um, I do a

1220
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:49.290
<v Larry Rosen:>lot of reading.

1221
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.480
<v Larry Rosen:>I follow what's going on in the

1222
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.980
<v Larry Rosen:>open source community.

1223
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:54.389
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm fascinated.

1224
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:58.679
<v Larry Rosen:>I occasionally respond, but mostly I'm interested

1225
01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.900
<v Larry Rosen:>in science.

1226
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.470
<v Larry Rosen:>Mostly I'm interested in physics, and I

1227
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Larry Rosen:>think if I had a life to

1228
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Larry Rosen:>live over again, I'd be an astronomer

1229
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:16.760
<v Larry Rosen:>or a cosmologist because.

1230
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:21.560
<v Larry Rosen:>There's bigger things in software.

1231
01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:34.340
<v Larry Rosen:>And because it's it's enlightening and challenging.

1232
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:38.570
<v Larry Rosen:>I watch these programs on Nova and

1233
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:44.600
<v Larry Rosen:>other television programs about astronomy and science,

1234
01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.309
<v Larry Rosen:>and I say, so now I understand

1235
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:52.910
<v Larry Rosen:>that a billion years from now, we

1236
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:54.080
<v Larry Rosen:>won't be here.

1237
01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:58.559
<v Larry Rosen:>A billion years from now, there'll be

1238
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Larry Rosen:>something else.

1239
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Larry Rosen:>God knows what.

1240
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.180
<v Larry Rosen:>But that's part of the universe.

1241
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.830
<v Larry Rosen:>That's the way the universe works.

1242
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.530
<v Larry Rosen:>That my.

1243
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.240
<v Larry Rosen:>I think about the fact that when

1244
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:20.309
<v Larry Rosen:>Albert Einstein reached the end of his

1245
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Larry Rosen:>life, he said, don't try to save

1246
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Larry Rosen:>me.

1247
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:35.310
<v Larry Rosen:>Don't try to put, you know, medicines

1248
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Larry Rosen:>in me that are going to cure

1249
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.370
<v Larry Rosen:>me of whatever in the world he

1250
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:39.059
<v Larry Rosen:>had.

1251
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:41.849
<v Larry Rosen:>He said, it's time.

1252
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Larry Rosen:>And so when I study science and

1253
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Larry Rosen:>when I studied physics and when I

1254
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Larry Rosen:>study cosmology, and I see.

1255
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.340
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, the future.

1256
01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm just thrilled.

1257
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.210
<v Larry Rosen:>I'm just delighted that I'm able to

1258
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.030
<v Larry Rosen:>last long enough to see.

1259
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.030
<v Larry Rosen:>To see the planets.

1260
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.950
<v Larry Rosen:>To see the comets.

1261
01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.950
<v Larry Rosen:>To see the stars explode and the

1262
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:27.940
<v Larry Rosen:>galaxies move about.

1263
01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.900
<v Larry Rosen:>What an opportunity.

1264
01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:35.559
<v Larry Rosen:>And and it's part of, you know,

1265
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:39.370
<v Larry Rosen:>it's just a growth for me of

1266
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.380
<v Larry Rosen:>the opportunity with open source.

1267
01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Larry Rosen:>Because I didn't create open source.

1268
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.840
<v Larry Rosen:>I didn't I didn't make it happen.

1269
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.040
<v Larry Rosen:>It happened.

1270
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.500
<v Larry Rosen:>But I was there.

1271
01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.170
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm here now.

1272
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:05.690
<v Larry Rosen:>And somehow or another life in the

1273
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:08.960
<v Larry Rosen:>universe are going to go on.

1274
01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:14.030
<v Larry Rosen:>And I'm just thrilled with that.

1275
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:20.120
<v Larry Rosen:>That's just just living long enough to

1276
01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:20.509
<v Larry Rosen:>see.

1277
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:23.540
<v Larry Rosen:>That has been marvelous.

1278
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.849
<v Karen Herman:>That's beautiful.

1279
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.040
<v Karen Herman:>The last question we ask our interviewees

1280
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:29.660
<v Karen Herman:>is, what would you want to say

1281
01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.370
<v Karen Herman:>to future generations if someone were to

1282
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.140
<v Karen Herman:>look at this interview 100 years from

1283
01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.580
<v Karen Herman:>now, what would you want to tell

1284
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:36.410
<v Karen Herman:>somebody who's different?

1285
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.540
<v Larry Rosen:>I thought about that when you first

1286
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:43.280
<v Larry Rosen:>asked me to do an interview, and

1287
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.310
<v Larry Rosen:>I thought back about the various people

1288
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:48.440
<v Larry Rosen:>I've met and the things I've done.

1289
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:51.890
<v Larry Rosen:>And I remember I once went to

1290
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Larry Rosen:>a conference, I think, in San Francisco.

1291
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.100
<v Larry Rosen:>And it was in one of the

1292
01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Larry Rosen:>big conference halls, and I was late,

1293
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Larry Rosen:>and I wandered in late, and there

1294
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:05.440
<v Larry Rosen:>was a guy sitting by the door,

1295
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:08.830
<v Larry Rosen:>a young man, I don't know, maybe

1296
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Larry Rosen:>20 years old.

1297
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:19.450
<v Larry Rosen:>And he was taking the tickets and

1298
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Larry Rosen:>he was serving as the doorman for

1299
01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.890
<v Larry Rosen:>the conference.

1300
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:29.890
<v Larry Rosen:>And when I gave him my identification

1301
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Larry Rosen:>and told him what I was, who

1302
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Larry Rosen:>I was, he says, oh, you're Larry

1303
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Larry Rosen:>Rosen.

1304
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Larry Rosen:>And I just felt warm.

1305
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:42.849
<v Larry Rosen:>So.

1306
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:46.299
<v Larry Rosen:>So the thing would be that he.

1307
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.470
<v Larry Rosen:>Has.

1308
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:59.000
<v Larry Rosen:>Develop that kind of service attitude.

1309
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Larry Rosen:>Um, awareness of the future.

1310
01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:12.740
<v Larry Rosen:>Awareness of opportunities, whether it be open

1311
01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.330
<v Larry Rosen:>source or AI or God knows what.

1312
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:22.490
<v Larry Rosen:>That I think about that 20 year

1313
01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.269
<v Larry Rosen:>old kid sitting at the door taking

1314
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.380
<v Larry Rosen:>tickets.

1315
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.460
<v Larry Rosen:>Uh, saying things about me or thinking

1316
01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.840
<v Larry Rosen:>things about me.

1317
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:38.510
<v Larry Rosen:>I remember when I was at Stanford

1318
01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:43.820
<v Larry Rosen:>doing my teaching, and one of the

1319
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:48.680
<v Larry Rosen:>people I ended up teaching was a

1320
01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.160
<v Larry Rosen:>Nobel laureate.

1321
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.630
<v Larry Rosen:>And I said, oh, you know, look

1322
01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.889
<v Larry Rosen:>at me.

1323
01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.660
<v Larry Rosen:>I was not quite 18 then, but

1324
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:06.810
<v Larry Rosen:>still working with a Nobel laureate.

1325
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.790
<v Larry Rosen:>Turns out I asked him a question

1326
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.940
<v Larry Rosen:>about electronics and he couldn't answer it.

1327
01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.140
<v Larry Rosen:>So, you know, I realized that it's.

1328
01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:21.809
<v Larry Rosen:>We look at our betters, we look

1329
01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:28.830
<v Larry Rosen:>at our our predecessors, and we stand

1330
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:33.750
<v Larry Rosen:>on their shoulders, and others stand on

1331
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:40.290
<v Larry Rosen:>our shoulders, and we do good things

1332
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.299
<v Larry Rosen:>and sometimes we don't.

1333
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Larry Rosen:>But my Wish is that that 18

1334
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.970
<v Larry Rosen:>or 20 year old guy that was

1335
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Larry Rosen:>taking tickets at the conference.

1336
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Larry Rosen:>Well, I said, oh, I met that

1337
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Larry Rosen:>guy and he charged me up a

1338
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:09.830
<v Larry Rosen:>little bit, gave me a ooh, look

1339
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Larry Rosen:>who I met kind of thing.

1340
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Larry Rosen:>And that he will become the next

1341
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.030

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:24.440
