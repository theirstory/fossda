1
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.800
<v Heather Meeker:>All right.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, today, I am talking to Roger

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Heather Meeker:>Dannenberg, who is a professor of community

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.207
<v Heather Meeker:>of Computer Science, Art and Music.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.587
<v Heather Meeker:>What a wonderful group of things to

6
00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Heather Meeker:>be a professor of, by the way

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Heather Meeker:>at Carnegie Mellon University and he is

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Heather Meeker:>also a Trumpeter, a Composer and a

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Computer Scientist, of course, and he's the

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Heather Meeker:>co-creator of Audacity, which is an extremely

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.699
<v Heather Meeker:>popular open source digital audio editor and

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Heather Meeker:>recording application.

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.561
<v Heather Meeker:>Roger, welcome to FOSSDA.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Heather Meeker:>I'm so happy that you're willing to

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Heather Meeker:>chat with us for a while today.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Heather Meeker:>So I'm going to just dive in

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Heather Meeker:>and say what was it that brought

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Heather Meeker:>you to working with an open to

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.600
<v Heather Meeker:>creating an open source project?

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Heather Meeker:>How did you make the decision to

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Heather Meeker:>do that?

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Well, the project started basically from research

23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>needs that that we have that we

24
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>were working on actually on query by

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>humming, which was getting computers to recognize

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>tunes that people might sing or hum

27
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.146
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and search a database for them and

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>part of that is just recognizing pitch

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and tunes and we were working on

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>some algorithms to improve that.

31
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And of course algorithms fail and then

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>when they fail, you want to see

33
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>what happened and we were trying to

34
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>visualize audio and the analyses that we

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>did and figure out what was going

36
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>wrong and we just felt like it

37
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>would be really great to have a

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>tool that could help us display audio

39
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>data in different formats and deal with

40
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>different audio files.

41
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>This comes up over and over again

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.787
<v Roger Dannenberg:>in audio and music research and at

43
00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the time there, the tools that were

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>there, just, you know, didn't seem very

45
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>good.

46
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>They were either very proprietary and we

47
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>had problems, you know, moving from one

48
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>computer to another or they were designed

49
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>for a special purpose and we were

50
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>doing research and wanted something more general

51
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>purpose.

52
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And so, you know, maybe it was

53
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>foolish to think that well, we could

54
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>just start from scratch and build our

55
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>own but that's what we did.

56
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And yeah, and so the actually, you

57
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, I'm not sure that we ever

58
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>certainly I never made an initial decision

59
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that "Oh, I want to build an

60
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>open source audio editor distributed in the

61
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.168
<v Roger Dannenberg:>world and it'll become the most popular."

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah.

63
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that It'll be the primary editor of

64
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>its kind in the world that just

65
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>never crossed our minds.

66
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>In fact, even, you know, at that

67
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>time which was around 2000, you know,

68
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>most people in the world didn't have

69
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the kinds of computers or the kinds

70
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.410
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of network connections and everything else that

71
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you would need to even distribute something

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>like this.

73
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, you know, it grew out of

74
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>some, some very personal goals and needs

75
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>in a lab.

76
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And it just it kind of happened

77
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>to be useful for some other things

78
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and make its way gradually out into

79
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the world and develop into what it

80
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>is now.

81
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Heather Meeker:>Is there a decision point that you

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.500
<v Heather Meeker:>recall where you decided?

83
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Heather Meeker:>This is going to be open source,

84
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Heather Meeker:>and we're going to collect, you know

85
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500
<v Heather Meeker:>input from a lot of people.

86
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.600
<v Heather Meeker:>How did that decision come about?

87
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.461
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah, a lot of from Dominic Mazzoni

88
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>who was a grad student at the

89
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>time and Dominic did did more of

90
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the work than anyone else.

91
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>It was mainly the two of us

92
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and I was contributing some kind of

93
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>low-level audio drivers that I had built

94
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and and worked on some symbolic display

95
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>as opposed to audio waveform display, but

96
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.068
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Dominic really put together the basic waveform

97
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>display and interaction.

98
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And it was it was Dominic that

99
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>suggested in the very beginning that if

100
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>if we are going to build something

101
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>to display data , it really wouldn't

102
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>be much additional work to cut copy

103
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>paste and right, you know, and write

104
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it back out to disk.

105
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So you could, we could integrate some

106
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>basic editing functions and I thought, well,

107
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>yeah, it makes sense.

108
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.099
<v Roger Dannenberg:>That's a great idea, but don't spend

109
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>too much time on it.

110
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So that worked out and and then

111
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it was really Dominic that that had

112
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>some particular ideas about, for example, using

113
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.599
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the canoe license.

114
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And, you know, sort of how things

115
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>would be organized and made into a

116
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.991
<v Roger Dannenberg:>open source distribution.

117
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I had previously done a lot of

118
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>software and made it available and not

119
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.099
<v Roger Dannenberg:>never really worried much about licensing or

120
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>any of these details.

121
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So I was happy also to get

122
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the software out there, especially since we

123
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>incorporated these editing functions and we thought

124
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.299
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it would be helpful at least other

125
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>researchers.

126
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And so, you know that and then

127
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the idea of a community and bringing

128
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>people in really came about after the

129
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>initial work.

130
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>We, you know, it was just us

131
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and we were using the software and

132
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>released it the software.

133
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.099
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And, but then later other people sort

134
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of started using it and wanted to

135
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>make improvements and most of that actually

136
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>happened interacting with he was he was

137
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.599
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the one that sort of pushed it

138
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>out there and he was the one

139
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that people got in contact with and

140
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and I had a lot of other

141
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>other duties teaching and researching and doing

142
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>doing my stuff back at Carnegie Mellon.

143
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So I was, you know, it kind

144
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of just evolved that way and then

145
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>because I was still a user and

146
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I have written some of the software

147
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and I was helping to do some

148
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>maintenance at at some point, you know,

149
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>much later in the game.

150
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I kind of came back into the

151
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>group and started working much more with

152
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.599
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the group and, with audacity.

153
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Heather Meeker:>So you said you'd developed other software

154
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.761
<v Heather Meeker:>before.

155
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Heather Meeker:>Do you perceive a difference?

156
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Heather Meeker:>Given this was an open source project

157
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Heather Meeker:>from sort of other projects you had

158
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Heather Meeker:>done.

159
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Like, did that change the character of

160
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.200
<v Heather Meeker:>the experience for you?

161
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Heather Meeker:>Or what?

162
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.599
<v Heather Meeker:>What was it about?

163
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.900
<v Heather Meeker:>It being open source that that made

164
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.800
<v Heather Meeker:>any difference.

165
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Well, I think maybe open sources is

166
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>really an outgrowth and maybe I just

167
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.099
<v Roger Dannenberg:>see it this way, but maybe it

168
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>really is an outgrowth of the academic

169
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>world.

170
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Where in academia we do research and

171
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you know, we get the rewards are

172
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.284
<v Roger Dannenberg:>not so much money, but recognition.

173
00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:37.799
<v Roger Dannenberg:>That people want to want to be

174
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>recognized for being, for making contributions to

175
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>whatever field, they do research or public

176
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>or writing in.

177
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And so, we publish, but we don't,

178
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>we don't publish, you know, and signed

179
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>book deals.

180
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Well, actually, we do sign book deals,

181
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>but terrible deals, right?

182
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>We're lucky.

183
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>We're lucky to get anyone to publish

184
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:09.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>anything because dry academic stuff and, similarly

185
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>with journal articles, like, you know, in

186
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>some sense, we're professional writers, but we

187
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.376
<v Roger Dannenberg:>don't get paid by the publishers.

188
00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Well, I don't know, if everybody knows

189
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.099
<v Roger Dannenberg:>this or not, but if you didn't

190
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, it might be interesting that, you

191
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, these thousands and thousands of scientific

192
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>papers that get, published the author's, typically

193
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>get zero and, and, the publishers.

194
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Many of the publishers are nonprofit organizations,

195
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>like communications for the associate.

196
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I mean, the association for computing machinery,

197
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>the ACM, or IEEE.

198
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>These are nonprofit organizations.

199
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.521
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, you know, the point is just

200
00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:02.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>to get the literature out there and

201
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and share it and and then our,

202
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you know, hiring and promotion is kind

203
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of based on peer review and our

204
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>recognition in the world.

205
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, we don't get anything directly from

206
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>publishing and and I think software is

207
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>at least when I was going through

208
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>school and, you know, decades ago software

209
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>was kind of in the same category

210
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.176
<v Roger Dannenberg:>as publishing.

211
00:10:33.176 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>People would write software, but academic publishing

212
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>people would write software and systems and

213
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and they put it out there and

214
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.992
<v Roger Dannenberg:>see if other people will use it

215
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and that was just kind of like

216
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>a form of experimental science to see

217
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>what works and what doesn't and so

218
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it seems it was almost unnatural to

219
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>me, to think about selling software and,

220
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I do actually have a few patents.

221
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>The first patent that I got was,

222
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>essentially a software patent, which a lot

223
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of people said "oh, you can't do

224
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that" and some people said it was

225
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>wrong.

226
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I felt like it was, I mean,

227
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>this particular patent, we won't go into

228
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.154
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it, but it was unless you want,

229
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it was you know for a very

230
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>specific invention and a very specific application,

231
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that seemed to have some real commercial

232
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>use and the patent was actually key

233
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>in enabling it to be commercialized.

234
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, but other than that, you know,

235
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>most of the stuff we do, we

236
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>don't like, we never expected anyone to

237
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>pay for this audio editor.

238
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>There were plenty of audio editor products

239
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>out there that were available, but we

240
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>wanted to make something free that would

241
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>help people do the kind of work

242
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that we were doing and we were

243
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>very fortunate to have some support through

244
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>other means, so we could afford to

245
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>do it and make it free.

246
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Yeah.

247
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.300
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, so for anyone who's watching and

248
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.215
<v Heather Meeker:>isn't aware of it, I mean, Audacity

249
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.100
<v Heather Meeker:>is basically on, I mean, I would

250
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.300
<v Heather Meeker:>think on the top of every musician

251
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.900
<v Heather Meeker:>and you know, audio editor and everybody

252
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.100
<v Heather Meeker:>uses this tool.

253
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Heather Meeker:>So clearly it evolved from something that

254
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Heather Meeker:>was basically a research project to something

255
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.400
<v Heather Meeker:>that had, you know, an incredible like

256
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.199
<v Heather Meeker:>mass audience and users everywhere.

257
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.900
<v Heather Meeker:>So as the project changed from what

258
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.699
<v Heather Meeker:>it was originally to what it was

259
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.376
<v Heather Meeker:>eventually.

260
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Heather Meeker:>Like how did how did the experience

261
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.900
<v Heather Meeker:>of participating in the project?

262
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.699
<v Heather Meeker:>Did it change for you at all?

263
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Heather Meeker:>When it like took a step up

264
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.515
<v Heather Meeker:>and got so popular?

265
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah, I think I mean I learned,

266
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I certainly learned some things from this.

267
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And one thing, one thing I learned

268
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.115
<v Roger Dannenberg:>just from observation was, is that Audacity

269
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>is very simple to use.

270
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And I mean, some people would say

271
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>no, it's not really that simple but

272
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>compared to the kind of software that

273
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>people are using in studios that, you

274
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, really take some work to get

275
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>into and to get things done.

276
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Audacity was deliberately made to be a

277
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>kind of what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor with direct manipulation

278
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and very simple menu commands and all

279
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of that stuff was there and on

280
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>purpose, you know, we talked about it.

281
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And again, I have to give Dominic

282
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>credit for wanting it to be that

283
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.599
<v Roger Dannenberg:>way because I think other developers including

284
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>me just trying to you know add

285
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>features I needed to do this.

286
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Let's do it like this and then

287
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you know, if you do that too

288
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>many times you end up with this

289
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>monster that nobody understands.

290
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah, and so Dominic was always kind

291
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of the back pressure saying yeah, we

292
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>could do that.

293
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>But you know that's going to be

294
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>confusing.

295
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>What if we did it like this?

296
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Or what if you know, or maybe

297
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>maybe we just shouldn't do that at

298
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>all.

299
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>You can do that, you know with

300
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>your own private extension or do it

301
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>with another piece of software or something

302
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and kind of that attitude of, this

303
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>has to be really simple, so that

304
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>anybody can just download it and start

305
00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>using it right away.

306
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Really, it was a huge contribution.

307
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And I think that's also something, you

308
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, maybe that open-source can do much

309
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>better than commercial ventures, which is that

310
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and I've learned this from the commercial

311
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.314
<v Roger Dannenberg:>side that products have to have features

312
00:15:22.315 --> 00:15:27.448
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and products in order to market products,

313
00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:30.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>at least the belief is that you

314
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>have to have a long feature list

315
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and you have to in order to

316
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>keep generating revenues you have to add

317
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>new features and the list, get longer

318
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and longer and longer and the interface

319
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>is get more and more complicated.

320
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And what we can do with open

321
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>source is safe, like we just don't

322
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.738
<v Roger Dannenberg:>care about selling, you know a new,

323
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>improved version with more features to people.

324
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>We just want to make the most

325
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>useful thing for people to use right

326
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>now and if they like it, maybe

327
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>they'll upgrade in a few years.

328
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And when they upgrade, you know, we'll

329
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>get a penny from advertising or something

330
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>but it just doesn't matter.

331
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And so we can really focus on

332
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>what's important for users.

333
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Heather Meeker:>Yeah, that's that's great.

334
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Heather Meeker:>So was there anything about the Open

335
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.200
<v Heather Meeker:>Source process?

336
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.400
<v Heather Meeker:>Participation, you know participated in running a

337
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Heather Meeker:>project and so forth, anything that you

338
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Heather Meeker:>wish you'd done differently, or that was

339
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.000
<v Heather Meeker:>a problem or a challenge and that

340
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.199
<v Heather Meeker:>you figured out how to solve or

341
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.500
<v Heather Meeker:>what were the downsides and how did

342
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.400
<v Heather Meeker:>you and the team react to those?

343
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Well, I think Audacity, you know, as

344
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you said it was incredibly successful and

345
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I don't think anyone could hope to

346
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>do something so successful, you know, by

347
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>design it just right.

348
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I've, in fact, I've tried to do

349
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>multiple other things by design, if they

350
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.854
<v Roger Dannenberg:>haven't worked out nearly as well, so..

351
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.500
<v Heather Meeker:>And if someone came to you and

352
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.000
<v Heather Meeker:>said, we're going to make this program

353
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Heather Meeker:>that's going to be wildly successful.

354
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.900
<v Heather Meeker:>How do we do that in?

355
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.400
<v Heather Meeker:>People would have just said?

356
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.618
<v Heather Meeker:>No, that's not possible.

357
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah, so but some issues that have

358
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>come up.

359
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I would say that the main issues

360
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>are getting people to work together.

361
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:52.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I'm working and I haven't really touched

362
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it in a long time.

363
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And I went back to sort of

364
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>see look for other versions and see

365
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>if there are any bug fixes or

366
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>things that uou know, may have happened

367
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.399
<v Roger Dannenberg:>on the side without me knowing about

368
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it and sure enough I found like

369
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>a hundred different repos on GitHub that

370
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>had clones of my software and various

371
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>things.

372
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:25.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, one thing that's, you know, that

373
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I've learned that's difficult, is to really

374
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>build a community of people that are

375
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.154
<v Roger Dannenberg:>working together to support the some thing

376
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and I'm not really sure how that

377
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>worked on Audacity.

378
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.399
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Maybe it was just you know, the

379
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>luck of having having the right people

380
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>kind of sign up and also just

381
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>having some very generous people that wanted

382
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>to say "well I'm you know, I'm

383
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.699
<v Roger Dannenberg:>not just going to take Audacity and

384
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>add some features and rebranded or something.

385
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I'm going to I'm going to work

386
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>on.

387
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I'm going to join the Audacity project.

388
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I'm going to contribute to this one

389
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>project and make it good." And, having

390
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>so getting people to actually contribute instead

391
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of just, you know, maybe take the

392
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>software and send you email saying you

393
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>should fix this.

394
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>You should fix that not putting any

395
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>time into it.

396
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>That's, I think that's a real problem.

397
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So another problem is when you do

398
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>have people that are contributing and very

399
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.569
<v Roger Dannenberg:>generous, you, well, at least with Audacity,

400
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>there was a team of people that

401
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.523
<v Roger Dannenberg:>developed.

402
00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So it was kind of like an

403
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>inside, you know, it's as if you've

404
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>got the inside group that has kind

405
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of all the power and all, you

406
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, carries all the all the decisions

407
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and you have the outside group, which

408
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you also hope is there, you know,

409
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>making contributions, but you know, the governance

410
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of very loose volunteer organization is really

411
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>difficult because I think if it is

412
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>completely open and everybody has an equal

413
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>vote, then it's very easy to get

414
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>distracted.

415
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>You know, someone will come in and

416
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>just make a lot of noise and

417
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>maybe not have much to contribute but

418
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.648
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it can be a real distraction.

419
00:20:36.648 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>On the other hand, if you have

420
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>sort of a core team that, that

421
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>team can you know, it runs the

422
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>risks of alienating other people or being

423
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>disconnected from other people.

424
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And, you know, I think Audacity's had

425
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>some very generous people, you know, we've

426
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>often referred to Dominic as the benevolent

427
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>dictator, which is a good description.

428
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>You know, he really put his heart

429
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>into it and did a lot to

430
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>keep things going and made really good

431
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>decisions all along.

432
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, but how do you how do

433
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you do that?

434
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Or how would you repeat that?

435
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>It's I think those are some really

436
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>difficult problems.

437
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Heather Meeker:>Yeah, I think leadership matters, no matter

438
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.900
<v Heather Meeker:>what you're doing, right?

439
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.399
<v Heather Meeker:>And a big project, a lot of

440
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.100
<v Heather Meeker:>what lots of volunteers can be very

441
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Heather Meeker:>challenging right?

442
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Heather Meeker:>Definitely.

443
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.600
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, so anything else you want to

444
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.200
<v Heather Meeker:>add?

445
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.300
<v Heather Meeker:>Before we wrap it up a, anything

446
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Heather Meeker:>you want to that you're looking at

447
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Heather Meeker:>in the future or anything you want

448
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.300
<v Heather Meeker:>to say about what your experiences have

449
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Heather Meeker:>been?

450
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Yeah, I would I guess I would

451
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>say that.

452
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>I mean one thing that came out

453
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of that, you know, that I learned

454
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>from this project, that might not be

455
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>obvious to people thinking about open source

456
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>is that there are a lot of

457
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>possibilities for generating income and one of

458
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>those is, you know, some of some

459
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of the Audacity developers, did some consulting

460
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>on the side.

461
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.115
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So they would, for example, adapt Audacity

462
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>for to be packaged with a product

463
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>or are bundled with a crime or

464
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>they would, you know, work with researchers

465
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>and get some money to add some

466
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>feature for them or something like that.

467
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:57.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Another possibility is that, you know, when

468
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>you go and download software, you think

469
00:22:59.600 --> 00:22:59.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>of it?

470
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>Oh, well great.

471
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>This is free.

472
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And you might wonder if you thought

473
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.899
<v Roger Dannenberg:>about it, you know, who's paying the

474
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>researcher, who's paying the electricity, and for

475
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>those servers like if we're downloading a

476
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>million copies of Audacity a month, that's

477
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Roger Dannenberg:>actually pretty expensive to provide that much

478
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>service.

479
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>You can't just, you know, run that

480
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>from home and so you might think,

481
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.399
<v Roger Dannenberg:>oh, well, you know how could an

482
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>open source project even afford to do

483
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.700
<v Roger Dannenberg:>that.

484
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And part of the answer is that

485
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>depending on where downloads take place, most

486
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>downloading services run ads.

487
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>And so the downloaders will actually pay

488
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>for the privilege of providing the servers

489
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>to download your software.

490
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.200
<v Roger Dannenberg:>It's not a lot of money.

491
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>So, and maybe that's a good thing

492
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>because if nobody's ever going to really

493
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.500
<v Roger Dannenberg:>get rich off of it, then it

494
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>just kind of can help grease the

495
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>wheels and you know, pay for an

496
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:14.199
<v Roger Dannenberg:>occasional machine or allow you to contract

497
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>out something that really needs to get

498
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.300
<v Roger Dannenberg:>done that, nobody wants to do for

499
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>pay for a graphics designer or you

500
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>know, there's it gives you some flexibility

501
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.600
<v Roger Dannenberg:>in a mostly volunteer effort, and so

502
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>anyway, those you know kind of the

503
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.000
<v Roger Dannenberg:>business and money side is something we

504
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Roger Dannenberg:>don't normally like to talk about but

505
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>are and it gets tricky.

506
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.800
<v Roger Dannenberg:>But it is real and I think

507
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.100
<v Roger Dannenberg:>it's part of the story thats interesting.

508
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.100
