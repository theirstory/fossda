00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.100
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Source Stories Digital Archive Foundation.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.719
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It's the 6th of June, 2023, and

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I am Elisabetta Mori, a historian of

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>computing currently based in Italy, and an

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.241
<v Elisabetta Mori:>oral history interviewer with FOSSDA.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Today, I'll be talking to software engineer,

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Eric Allman, author of the mail transfer

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>agent, Sendmail.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>We are recording on TheirStory.io, and I

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Elisabetta Mori:>am in Rio, in Elba, in Elba

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Island, Italy, and Eric is in Berkeley,

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>California.

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Welcome, Eric.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.559
<v Eric Allman:>Thank you.

16
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you for being here today.

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Where and when were you born?

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Eric Allman:>I was born in Oakland, which is

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Eric Allman:>the next town over from Berkeley.

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Eric Allman:>And back in 1955, which I sometimes

21
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Eric Allman:>wonder how old I'm getting to be

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Eric Allman:>now, and moved when I was about

23
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Eric Allman:>two and a half, three maybe, to

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Eric Allman:>El Cerrito, which is a town on

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Eric Allman:>the other side of Berkeley.

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Eric Allman:>And then at some point I moved

27
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Eric Allman:>into Berkeley.

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Eric Allman:>So I've been, I think of myself

29
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Eric Allman:>as a Berkeley boy through.

30
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Hello?

31
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Eric Allman:>Yes, hi.

32
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Eric Allman:>We had a glitch there.

33
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay.

34
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, can you describe your parents?

35
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Eric Allman:>Sure, my mother was a basically spent

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Eric Allman:>her life in education.

37
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Eric Allman:>She was a school teacher originally in

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Eric Allman:>the Head Start program and later became

39
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Eric Allman:>a regular classroom teacher and at some

40
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Eric Allman:>point got her master's degree and moved

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Eric Allman:>up to the principal role, which she

42
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Eric Allman:>did for the rest of her career.

43
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Eric Allman:>My father was, when I was born,

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Eric Allman:>was an adman for the Richmond Independent,

45
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Eric Allman:>which was a local paper, long gone

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Eric Allman:>now.

47
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.859
<v Eric Allman:>And at some point he and my

48
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Eric Allman:>mother divorced, and so I'm not as

49
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Eric Allman:>completely clear about what he was doing

50
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Eric Allman:>after that, but he stayed in advertising

51
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Eric Allman:>for a while and wrote a newspaper

52
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Eric Allman:>column called Art Who, which was an

53
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.160
<v Eric Allman:>art critic column, and at some point

54
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.040
<v Eric Allman:>kind of retired and was at that

55
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Eric Allman:>point just sort of an art collector.

56
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Eric Allman:>Oh, we did art brokering for a

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Eric Allman:>while too.

58
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Eric Allman:>And my mother passed away a couple

59
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Eric Allman:>years ago, and my father, actually my

60
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Eric Allman:>mother passed away about five years ago,

61
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.300
<v Eric Allman:>and my father passed away about two

62
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Eric Allman:>years ago, maybe three.

63
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I'm sorry.

64
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What about your siblings?

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Eric Allman:>I have one sister, Kat, who...

66
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.000
<v Eric Allman:>How can I put this?

67
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Eric Allman:>My sister was, you know, if I

68
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Eric Allman:>was the kind of mathematical one in

69
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Eric Allman:>the family, she was the, you know,

70
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Eric Allman:>humanities person.

71
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Eric Allman:>And she had, I think, a difficult

72
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Eric Allman:>time because I was considered to be

73
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Eric Allman:>the great student and she always felt

74
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Eric Allman:>like she was in my shadow.

75
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.399
<v Eric Allman:>And what's happened is, in fact, she

76
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Eric Allman:>ended up going to work at Google

77
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.160
<v Eric Allman:>very early on doing open source developer

78
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Eric Allman:>relations and I don't know I think

79
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Eric Allman:>she was there 15 years, which is

80
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.020
<v Eric Allman:>pretty amazing and she's recently left and

81
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Eric Allman:>I think she's still contemplating whether she

82
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Eric Allman:>wants to retire or you know go

83
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Eric Allman:>for another job.

84
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.534
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What was your family life like?

85
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.654
<v Eric Allman:>My family life?

86
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.040
<v Eric Allman:>Well, as I mentioned my parents got

87
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Eric Allman:>divorced when I was quite young.

88
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Eric Allman:>And so I came from what they

89
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.940
<v Eric Allman:>used to call back then a broken

90
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Eric Allman:>family, although I don't think there was

91
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.880
<v Eric Allman:>anything particularly broken about it.

92
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Eric Allman:>My mother was an absolutely wonderful mother

93
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.940
<v Eric Allman:>who, you know, was at one point

94
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.599
<v Eric Allman:>going to school, had a full time

95
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Eric Allman:>job and raising two kids by herself

96
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Eric Allman:>and never seemed to break a sweat.

97
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Eric Allman:>It was quite astounding.

98
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.772
<v Eric Allman:>When she was going to school, my

99
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Eric Allman:>sister and I would sometimes, actually most

100
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Eric Allman:>of the time, spend summers at my

101
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Eric Allman:>grandparents' place.

102
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.100
<v Eric Allman:>That would be her parents.

103
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Eric Allman:>And they lived out in the country

104
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Eric Allman:>in Sebastopol.

105
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Eric Allman:>So there was a, what was it,

106
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.799
<v Eric Allman:>12-acre, I think, forest to explore and

107
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Eric Allman:>so forth.

108
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Eric Allman:>So, you know, not a bad way

109
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.700
<v Eric Allman:>to spend your summers.

110
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Eric Allman:>A little lonely, I guess, because they

111
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Eric Allman:>were down at the end of a

112
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.740
<v Eric Allman:>dirt road and there just weren't anyone

113
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.800
<v Eric Allman:>my age around.

114
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Eric Allman:>But that was fairly informative, yes.

115
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.159
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So which schools did you attend and

116
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>what were your favorite subjects?

117
00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:17.340
<v Eric Allman:>I'll skip kindergarten.

118
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.979
<v Eric Allman:>I went to actually a couple of

119
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.719
<v Eric Allman:>different, we called them junior high schools.

120
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Eric Allman:>They're called middle schools now and then

121
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.039
<v Eric Allman:>I ended up at El Cerrito High

122
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:44.520
<v Eric Allman:>School which might as I've already intimated

123
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Eric Allman:>my specialties seem to be like math

124
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Eric Allman:>and science.

125
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Eric Allman:>No particularly great surprise, but, you know,

126
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Eric Allman:>I did other things too.

127
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Eric Allman:>In high school, at, I think my

128
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.280
<v Eric Allman:>sister's suggestion, I got involved doing work

129
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Eric Allman:>in the theater, which was a really

130
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.680
<v Eric Allman:>astounding thing.

131
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Eric Allman:>I did sound, and making sound effects

132
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Eric Allman:>was quite interesting.

133
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Eric Allman:>At one point I had to make

134
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.620
<v Eric Allman:>the sound of a train crash.

135
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.520
<v Eric Allman:>That was fun.

136
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.180
<v Elisabetta Mori:>How did you do it?

137
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Eric Allman:>I went into the theater when no

138
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.080
<v Eric Allman:>one was around and laid a ladder

139
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.119
<v Eric Allman:>on the stage, piled chairs on top

140
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.760
<v Eric Allman:>of the ladder, tied a rope around

141
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.559
<v Eric Allman:>the ladder and pulled the whole thing

142
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Eric Allman:>onto the ground.

143
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Eric Allman:>I think I then, you know, slowed

144
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.160
<v Eric Allman:>it down or something like that a

145
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.280
<v Eric Allman:>little bit and so forth.

146
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Eric Allman:>It was pretty cool.

147
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.100
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So let's talk about university.

148
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You went to University of California, Berkeley

149
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in 1973?

150
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.040
<v Eric Allman:>Yes.

151
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And you got a Bachelor in Electronic

152
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Engineering and Computer Science in 1977 and

153
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.859
<v Elisabetta Mori:>a Master of Science in Computer Science

154
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in June 1980.

155
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.900
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what are your memories of those

156
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>years?

157
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Eric Allman:>I was not a particularly happy kid

158
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Eric Allman:>in high school.

159
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I did well in classes

160
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Eric Allman:>and so forth, but I never really

161
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.320
<v Eric Allman:>felt connected to my peers.

162
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.380
<v Eric Allman:>I think part of that, in fact,

163
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Eric Allman:>I'm sure part of it was, you

164
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Eric Allman:>know, by high school I had realized

165
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Eric Allman:>that I was gay, but I was

166
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Eric Allman:>still very much in the closet.

167
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:55.360
<v Eric Allman:>And attitudes then were not as forgiving

168
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.620
<v Eric Allman:>as they are today.

169
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.720
<v Eric Allman:>And so, I kind of started over

170
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Eric Allman:>from scratch when I went to Berkeley.

171
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Eric Allman:>And I have only kept in touch

172
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Eric Allman:>with a couple of people from my

173
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Eric Allman:>high school days.

174
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.540
<v Eric Allman:>The Berkeley was great for me.

175
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Eric Allman:>It helped that I had no social

176
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Eric Allman:>life because that way I could do

177
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Eric Allman:>all of my homework.

178
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Eric Allman:>And remember, you know, physics problem set

179
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.199
<v Eric Allman:>was all day Saturday and math problem

180
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Eric Allman:>set was all day Sunday.

181
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.740
<v Eric Allman:>So, and I was taking computer classes.

182
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Eric Allman:>So back in high school, actually in

183
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.120
<v Eric Allman:>junior high school, there was a teacher,

184
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Eric Allman:>I guess a math teacher at a

185
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Eric Allman:>different school when I was in who

186
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Eric Allman:>decided it would be cool to do

187
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.540
<v Eric Allman:>an after-school program teaching kids how to

188
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Eric Allman:>program, Fortran to be precise.

189
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.280
<v Eric Allman:>And I got involved with that and

190
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Eric Allman:>learned Fortran.

191
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Eric Allman:>So I already knew some computer languages

192
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.940
<v Eric Allman:>when I got into Berkeley, which gave

193
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.339
<v Eric Allman:>me a definite leg up because, you

194
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Eric Allman:>know, it wasn't like today where everyone

195
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Eric Allman:>learns coding in, you know, elementary schools.

196
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.439
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So..

197
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>so was there any particular reason why

198
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you chose Berkeley?

199
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.319
<v Eric Allman:>You know, when I was a little

200
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.160
<v Eric Allman:>kid, my parents would take me over

201
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Eric Allman:>to campus and I would play in

202
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.620
<v Eric Allman:>the Strawberry Creek.

203
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.320
<v Eric Allman:>You know, Berkeley campus was just sort

204
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.240
<v Eric Allman:>of part of my life and always

205
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Eric Allman:>had been.

206
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Eric Allman:>And I can't even remember if I

207
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Eric Allman:>even applied to any other schools.

208
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Eric Allman:>It just, it seemed like the obvious

209
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.300
<v Eric Allman:>thing.

210
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Eric Allman:>There were other practical issues.

211
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Eric Allman:>My mother was still a schoolteacher at

212
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Eric Allman:>that point.

213
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, frankly, we didn't make

214
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Eric Allman:>very much money.

215
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.820
<v Eric Allman:>And so this way I could live

216
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.240
<v Eric Allman:>at home, commute into campus.

217
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Eric Allman:>And so combination of good school, familiar

218
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.439
<v Eric Allman:>place, money, And I don't know, it

219
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.580
<v Eric Allman:>just, it's always felt right.

220
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Eric Allman:>That's, you know, fairly obscure, I guess,

221
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.120
<v Eric Allman:>but, you know, the computer science at

222
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.439
<v Eric Allman:>Berkeley, computer science department existed, but it

223
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.780
<v Eric Allman:>wasn't the powerhouse that it is today.

224
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Eric Allman:>So it wasn't like I was going,

225
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.600
<v Eric Allman:>oh that's the best school in the

226
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Eric Allman:>country for it.

227
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Eric Allman:>It probably is today, but not then.

228
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.160
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Was there any particular episode that you

229
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>remember from those years?

230
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.420
<v Eric Allman:>Many of them.

231
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Eric Allman:>I was a pretty obnoxious kid back

232
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.840
<v Eric Allman:>then.

233
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Eric Allman:>You know, dealing with all this emotional

234
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Eric Allman:>stuff going on with me, left me

235
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Eric Allman:>kind of hostile and so forth.

236
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.420
<v Eric Allman:>I think about it now and wonder

237
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Eric Allman:>how anyone put up with me at

238
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.340
<v Eric Allman:>all.

239
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.600
<v Eric Allman:>And in particular, I would be in

240
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.660
<v Eric Allman:>classes where somebody was teaching programming and

241
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Eric Allman:>if they made even the slightest mistake,

242
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Eric Allman:>I would interrupt the professor and point

243
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.560
<v Eric Allman:>out his mistake.

244
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.680
<v Eric Allman:>That did not endear me to people,

245
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Eric Allman:>but it did give me a reputation.

246
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.239
<v Eric Allman:>And at some point there was a

247
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Eric Allman:>brand new research project called the Ingress

248
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.360
<v Eric Allman:>Project Interactive Graphics and Retrieval System, which

249
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.740
<v Eric Allman:>was actually a database management system.

250
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Eric Allman:>It wasn't in the name.

251
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.480
<v Eric Allman:>And it was one of the first

252
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Eric Allman:>relational databases around.

253
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Eric Allman:>There were two projects in the whole

254
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Eric Allman:>world doing relational databases.

255
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Eric Allman:>One of them was Ingress at Berkeley

256
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Eric Allman:>and the other was System R from

257
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.760
<v Eric Allman:>IBM and San Jose.

258
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Eric Allman:>And so Mike Stonebreaker, who was the

259
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Eric Allman:>PI, principal investigator on Ingress, You know,

260
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Eric Allman:>I guess actually he was supposed to

261
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.440
<v Eric Allman:>be my undergrad advisor as well.

262
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Eric Allman:>Anyway, he suggested that I might come

263
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.900
<v Eric Allman:>up, come in as a part-time Senior

264
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.360
<v Eric Allman:>Engineering Aid was I think the title,

265
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.380
<v Eric Allman:>which, you know, I got paid, which

266
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.620
<v Eric Allman:>seemed like an immense amount of money

267
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.439
<v Eric Allman:>because I never had any money before

268
00:13:59.440 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Eric Allman:>then.

269
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.780
<v Eric Allman:>It was, you know, probably $800 a

270
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.940
<v Eric Allman:>month or something like that, but it

271
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Eric Allman:>was greater than zero.

272
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Eric Allman:>And so I ended up being dropped

273
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Eric Allman:>into a grad school setting when I

274
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.800
<v Eric Allman:>was a sophomore and that definitely changed

275
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.940
<v Eric Allman:>my life that was an amazing experience

276
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.620
<v Eric Allman:>and I can probably tell stories for

277
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.859
<v Eric Allman:>hours about that, but I won't bore

278
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Eric Allman:>you.

279
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.360
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Just tell one.

280
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Eric Allman:>Sorry?

281
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.780
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Just tell one, Ben.

282
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.720
<v Eric Allman:>Just one.

283
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.580
<v Eric Allman:>Part of the thing that was interesting

284
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.860
<v Eric Allman:>about the Ingress project is we were

285
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Eric Allman:>doing some really cutting edge research.

286
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Eric Allman:>It was also pretty laid back.

287
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.120
<v Eric Allman:>And so people would be, you know,

288
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.040
<v Eric Allman:>have other side projects that they were

289
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.480
<v Eric Allman:>doing, and I had a bunch of

290
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Eric Allman:>side projects, some of which I've become

291
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Eric Allman:>quite well known for.

292
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:30.300
<v Eric Allman:>And that freedom allowed me to explore

293
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.020
<v Eric Allman:>a lot of things that I, if

294
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.739
<v Eric Allman:>I was just, you know, in the

295
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.860
<v Eric Allman:>standard undergraduate program, I never would have

296
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Eric Allman:>been exposed to.

297
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.860
<v Eric Allman:>And the other thing was the Ingress

298
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Eric Allman:>project was working on Unix, which was,

299
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.780
<v Eric Allman:>I think, Unix, when I first started,

300
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.440
<v Eric Allman:>it was Unix version 4.

301
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Eric Allman:>And quickly it went up to 5

302
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.120
<v Eric Allman:>version 5 and then version 6 for

303
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.020
<v Eric Allman:>a long time.

304
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Eric Allman:>But I got to kind of, ride

305
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.914
<v Eric Allman:>the Unix wave at the same time.

306
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.823
<v Eric Allman:>And that was also a growth experience

307
00:16:08.823 --> 00:16:12.100
<v Eric Allman:>and I started going to youth conferences

308
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Eric Allman:>and met a lot of people.

309
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.220
<v Eric Allman:>So, you know, serendipitous.

310
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.540
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, during the years at Berkeley, you

311
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>worked on Ingress Project, but also in

312
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the early 1980s, you designed DeliverMail.

313
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.180
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you tell us about it?

314
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.240
<v Eric Allman:>Yes.

315
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.439
<v Eric Allman:>So the Ingress Project at some point

316
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Eric Allman:>got a DARPA grant- Defense Advanced Research

317
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.040
<v Eric Allman:>Projects Agency, which meant we had a

318
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Eric Allman:>link to the ARPANET.

319
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Eric Allman:>The ARPANET is the network that existed

320
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Eric Allman:>before the internet.

321
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.760
<v Eric Allman:>And it was a small network, you

322
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.800
<v Eric Allman:>know, a couple hundred machines on the

323
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.399
<v Eric Allman:>entire network, couldn't grow any larger than

324
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Eric Allman:>that.

325
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.020
<v Eric Allman:>But there was enough going on that

326
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Eric Allman:>everyone in the department wanted an account

327
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.540
<v Eric Allman:>on our machines so that they could

328
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Eric Allman:>connect to the network.

329
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Eric Allman:>And, um, we didn't have a particularly

330
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.080
<v Eric Allman:>big machine because, you know, we didn't

331
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.700
<v Eric Allman:>have a massive brand.

332
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Eric Allman:>So we said, okay, we can free

333
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Eric Allman:>up two RS-232 ports, just a simple

334
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Eric Allman:>text only way to connect to the

335
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.100
<v Eric Allman:>machine.

336
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.980
<v Eric Allman:>And since these ports cost, you know,

337
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.860
<v Eric Allman:>500 bucks a piece or whatever, it

338
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.480
<v Eric Allman:>was just..we told other people if you

339
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.000
<v Eric Allman:>want more you can pay for it

340
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.120
<v Eric Allman:>yourself, basically.

341
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.720
<v Eric Allman:>And nobody wanted to pay for it

342
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Eric Allman:>themselves.

343
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Eric Allman:>So there were two ports being shared

344
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Eric Allman:>by the entire department.

345
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Eric Allman:>And you can imagine this got into

346
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.480
<v Eric Allman:>some uncomfortable situation.

347
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Eric Allman:>And at that point, I was already

348
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Eric Allman:>sort of the main system administrator for

349
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.220
<v Eric Allman:>that machine.

350
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.440
<v Eric Allman:>And so I was, of course, the

351
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.300
<v Eric Allman:>person they complained to.

352
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.720
<v Eric Allman:>And usually, of course, they couldn't do

353
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.340
<v Eric Allman:>anything about it, but they complained to

354
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Eric Allman:>me anyway.

355
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Eric Allman:>And at some point, I made the

356
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Eric Allman:>observation that what most people wanted access

357
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.080
<v Eric Allman:>to was email.

358
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Eric Allman:>Now, it turns out we already had

359
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Eric Allman:>a- another very slow, also terminal-based network

360
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Eric Allman:>called Birknet, which was a project done

361
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.180
<v Eric Allman:>by a guy named Eric Schmidt, who

362
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Eric Allman:>later became CEO of Google.

363
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Eric Allman:>So I worked with Eric.

364
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.440
<v Eric Allman:>And it would send mail, but only

365
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.320
<v Eric Allman:>inside the campus.

366
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.520
<v Eric Allman:>It wouldn't go out.

367
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.340
<v Eric Allman:>And similarly, mail from ARPANET wouldn't go

368
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Eric Allman:>to another machine.

369
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.041
<v Eric Allman:>And so I said, you know, Birknet

370
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:30.159
<v Eric Allman:>is software, ARPANET is software, and I

371
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Eric Allman:>know how to write software.

372
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.120
<v Eric Allman:>I'll bet I can find some way

373
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.960
<v Eric Allman:>to glue these things together so you

374
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Eric Allman:>can get your email on your home

375
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.560
<v Eric Allman:>machine, not on your machine.

376
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Eric Allman:>And that was a quick hack called

377
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.540
<v Eric Allman:>DeliverMail.

378
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Eric Allman:>And I won't say it worked well,

379
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.880
<v Eric Allman:>but it did work and so I

380
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Eric Allman:>basically wrote Deliver Mail to get people

381
00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980
<v Eric Allman:>to stop bothering me.

382
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.540
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you describe Eric Schmidt?

383
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Eric Allman:>Eric was driven.

384
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.939
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I think we all you

385
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.020
<v Eric Allman:>know all the students kind of knew

386
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.540
<v Eric Allman:>that Eric was going to be CEO

387
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Eric Allman:>of a big company someday because, you

388
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Eric Allman:>know, he got a dual major in

389
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Eric Allman:>business and computer science.

390
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Eric Allman:>And, you

391
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Eric Allman:>know, I got along with Eric, but

392
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.360
<v Eric Allman:>he could be a pain in the

393
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Eric Allman:>butt sometimes, actually.

394
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Eric Allman:>On the other hand, I could too,

395
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Eric Allman:>so it was only fair.

396
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.020
<v Eric Allman:>But yeah, he, I mean, I think

397
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.860
<v Eric Allman:>genuinely he was, he had in his

398
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>head that he was going to be

399
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.560
<v Eric Allman:>CEO of a major corporation.

400
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.720
<v Eric Allman:>He just focused his entire life on

401
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.220
<v Eric Allman:>that.

402
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.320
<v Eric Allman:>And he succeeded.

403
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay, let's go back to your life

404
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and career.

405
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.009
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what about SendMail?

406
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.060
<v Eric Allman:>Okay, so one of the superstars at

407
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.940
<v Eric Allman:>Berkeley was a guy named Bill Joy.

408
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Eric Allman:>And, um, Bill Joy at some point

409
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.360
<v Eric Allman:>did a, uh, distribution.

410
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.326
<v Eric Allman:>So back then it was kind of,

411
00:21:28.326 --> 00:21:32.520
<v Eric Allman:>suppose you'd call it early days of

412
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.620
<v Eric Allman:>what we call open source software.

413
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.440
<v Eric Allman:>It wasn't really because there was open

414
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.160
<v Eric Allman:>source software back in the 50s.

415
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.179
<v Eric Allman:>The IBM share conference was called share

416
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Eric Allman:>because it was specifically about, hey, you

417
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Eric Allman:>know, here's a tape of the stuff

418
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.880
<v Eric Allman:>I've been working on, give me a

419
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.040
<v Eric Allman:>tape of what you've been working on.

420
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Eric Allman:>So just give us a swap meet.

421
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.280
<v Eric Allman:>Usenix got to be very much like

422
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Eric Allman:>a swap meet as well.

423
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.140
<v Eric Allman:>And there were a bunch of people

424
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.480
<v Eric Allman:>in the area who were actively working

425
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.520
<v Eric Allman:>on Unix and developing it and whatnot,

426
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.480
<v Eric Allman:>including Bill and a bunch of others

427
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.500
<v Eric Allman:>at Berkeley and Tom Farran at the

428
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.700
<v Eric Allman:>UC San Francisco.

429
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Eric Allman:>And so, I mean, there were some

430
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Eric Allman:>really exciting meetings in Bill's office sometimes

431
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.440
<v Eric Allman:>where you get all of these, you

432
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.920
<v Eric Allman:>know, super high powered people hogging the

433
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.400
<v Eric Allman:>whiteboard.

434
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Eric Allman:>I guess it was actually chalkboards back

435
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:33.674
<v Eric Allman:>then.

436
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.980
<v Eric Allman:>Ken Thompson came out to Berkeley on

437
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Eric Allman:>sabbatical for a year.

438
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Eric Allman:>So you know, I have actually I

439
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.120
<v Eric Allman:>have here in my desk drawer a

440
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.140
<v Eric Allman:>listing of the version 6 UNIX kernel

441
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.020
<v Eric Allman:>hand-annotated because Ken actually gave a free

442
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.340
<v Eric Allman:>class, evening class, where he walked through

443
00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.240
<v Eric Allman:>the Kernel and taught everyone how it

444
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Eric Allman:>worked.

445
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Eric Allman:>And there were, I think, maybe a

446
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Eric Allman:>dozen people in the room.

447
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.760
<v Eric Allman:>You know, now if you were to

448
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.320
<v Eric Allman:>do something like that, of course, you

449
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Eric Allman:>have to fire the Coliseum out.

450
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.560
<v Eric Allman:>And so it was a very, very

451
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.140
<v Eric Allman:>exciting environment to be in.

452
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.320
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, I think I may

453
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.860
<v Eric Allman:>have lost track of the question.

454
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.229
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I was asking you about SendMail.

455
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Eric Allman:>Ah, yes.

456
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Eric Allman:>So Bill did Berkeley software distributions.

457
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Eric Allman:>Can't remember now second, third Berkeley software

458
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Eric Allman:>distribution was getting to be kind of

459
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.780
<v Eric Allman:>to the form of a whole system

460
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.520
<v Eric Allman:>and at this point it still required

461
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.260
<v Eric Allman:>an AT&T License so it wasn't really

462
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Eric Allman:>open source in the way that it

463
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.867
<v Eric Allman:>is today.

464
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.240
<v Eric Allman:>But since everyone who was using Unix

465
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.680
<v Eric Allman:>had to have an AT&T license, it

466
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.720
<v Eric Allman:>was kind of sort of open source

467
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.700
<v Eric Allman:>within that community.

468
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:19.780
<v Eric Allman:>And so Berkeley, so Bob Fabry, who

469
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.020
<v Eric Allman:>was a faculty member there, started up

470
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.320
<v Eric Allman:>the Computer Systems Research Group, CSRG, and

471
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Eric Allman:>hired Bill and a bunch of other

472
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Eric Allman:>people whose names you probably recognize.

473
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Eric Allman:>And they got a grant from DARPA

474
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.300
<v Eric Allman:>to create the system for the internet,

475
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.860
<v Eric Allman:>as yet non-existent internet.

476
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.187
<v Eric Allman:>So we ended up doing the TCP/IP

477
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.280
<v Eric Allman:>stack at Berkeley, incorporating ideas from other

478
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Eric Allman:>places.

479
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.880
<v Eric Allman:>I don't want to say we did

480
00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Eric Allman:>everything.

481
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.500
<v Eric Allman:>We were, in fact, very open to

482
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Eric Allman:>picking up other people's work and integrating

483
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Eric Allman:>it.

484
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.580
<v Eric Allman:>And one of the things that was

485
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.480
<v Eric Allman:>needed was a mail system.

486
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.500
<v Eric Allman:>And the mail system for the internet

487
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.120
<v Eric Allman:>was completely, utterly different than the mail

488
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.480
<v Eric Allman:>system on the ARPANET.

489
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.080
<v Eric Allman:>And so at that point, I had

490
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.320
<v Eric Allman:>done deliver mail.

491
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Eric Allman:>And Bill came to me and said,

492
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Eric Allman:>so Eric, you know more about email

493
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.000
<v Eric Allman:>than anyone else here.

494
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.200
<v Eric Allman:>Why don't you do it?

495
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.280
<v Eric Allman:>At that point, I was working on

496
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.120
<v Eric Allman:>the Ingress project but you know never

497
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Eric Allman:>wanted to pass up an interesting problem.

498
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.620
<v Eric Allman:>I agreed to do this and if

499
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.860
<v Eric Allman:>I had known how hard it was

500
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.199
<v Eric Allman:>going to be I would never have

501
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.120
<v Eric Allman:>agreed to it.

502
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Eric Allman:>It was a lot of work.

503
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Eric Allman:>But, you know, I stuck with it.

504
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.959
<v Eric Allman:>And so when, you know, on the

505
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.680
<v Eric Allman:>day, literally there was a day when

506
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Eric Allman:>the Internet got turned on, Sendmail was

507
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.720
<v Eric Allman:>the mail program for the entire Internet.

508
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.260
<v Eric Allman:>And it snowballed from there.

509
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>During those years you also produced Syslog.

510
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Eric Allman:>Ah, yes.

511
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.540
<v Eric Allman:>Syslog, much less exciting I suppose, but

512
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Eric Allman:>arguably more important, was just a way

513
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.080
<v Eric Allman:>to, for various programs to write to

514
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.800
<v Eric Allman:>a log file to say what they're

515
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.480
<v Eric Allman:>doing, which when you're writing programs that

516
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Eric Allman:>you run them and they run and

517
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.040
<v Eric Allman:>then they stop, you can print stuff

518
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.600
<v Eric Allman:>out and so forth and that's easy

519
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Eric Allman:>but if you're running writing a program

520
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Eric Allman:>where it runs in the background and

521
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Eric Allman:>you never actually see its output, it

522
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.760
<v Eric Allman:>has to have some place where you

523
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.280
<v Eric Allman:>can figure out what's going on when

524
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.240
<v Eric Allman:>it's not working.

525
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.960
<v Eric Allman:>The usual thing then was you open

526
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Eric Allman:>a file and write to that file.

527
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.940
<v Eric Allman:>And the file is somewhere.

528
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Eric Allman:>There was no standard for where it

529
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.679
<v Eric Allman:>should be in the file system.

530
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.120
<v Eric Allman:>So it would always be a, you

531
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.080
<v Eric Allman:>know, where do I find the log

532
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.340
<v Eric Allman:>file for this program?

533
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Eric Allman:>It's around here somewhere.

534
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.940
<v Eric Allman:>Maybe I'll be in somebody's home directory

535
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Eric Allman:>for all I know.

536
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Eric Allman:>And the other thing was when you

537
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.460
<v Eric Allman:>have multiple writers that, and you're writing

538
00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Eric Allman:>to a log file, they interact with

539
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.200
<v Eric Allman:>each other and you can get alphabet

540
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:38.800
<v Eric Allman:>soup.

541
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Eric Allman:>So I wanted a system where you

542
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Eric Allman:>could send a message to a demon

543
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Eric Allman:>that would look at the message and

544
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.660
<v Eric Allman:>then take a configuration file and tell

545
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.940
<v Eric Allman:>it where that message should be logged.

546
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.640
<v Eric Allman:>And it could be multiple places.

547
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.320
<v Eric Allman:>And that syslog is still in use.

548
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Eric Allman:>It's been rewritten since then, but it's

549
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.740
<v Eric Allman:>still fundamentally the same thing.

550
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Eric Allman:>It's actually, it's an internet standard now.

551
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Eric Allman:>And so maybe not the most exciting

552
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.379
<v Eric Allman:>thing I've ever done, but possibly the

553
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.940
<v Eric Allman:>most important or impactful let me say.

554
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.460
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What about dash MI macros?

555
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Eric Allman:>Ah, the ME macros.

556
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.180
<v Elisabetta Mori:>ME macros, yes.

557
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:39.920
<v Eric Allman:>So, yeah, there was, Unix had some

558
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.980
<v Eric Allman:>programs for doing text formatting.

559
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.959
<v Eric Allman:>And there was one early on called

560
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Eric Allman:>Rof, which was very simple.

561
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.080
<v Eric Allman:>And then another one came along called

562
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Eric Allman:>NROF, which was the new Rof.

563
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.080
<v Eric Allman:>Rof stood for runoff.

564
00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.760
<v Eric Allman:>So it was the new runoff program.

565
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Eric Allman:>And then there was another system that

566
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Eric Allman:>came out compatible with NROF later called

567
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.260
<v Eric Allman:>TROF, which actually went to a photo

568
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Eric Allman:>typesetting.

569
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.320
<v Eric Allman:>But the thing about NROF and TROF

570
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.960
<v Eric Allman:>is they were almost unusable without a

571
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.440
<v Eric Allman:>macro package because it was a brilliant

572
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Eric Allman:>design that gave you just the very

573
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.640
<v Eric Allman:>barest tools you needed to essentially implement

574
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.520
<v Eric Allman:>your own language.

575
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.540
<v Eric Allman:>And Berkeley had nRoth and I think

576
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.959
<v Eric Allman:>actually had tRoth but it did not

577
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.100
<v Eric Allman:>have a macro package.

578
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.120
<v Eric Allman:>AT&T wouldn't release that.

579
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Eric Allman:>And so I decided I was going

580
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.500
<v Eric Allman:>to build one because I really wanted

581
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.334
<v Eric Allman:>to use NROF.

582
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Eric Allman:>And so I ended up doing the

583
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:55.620
<v Eric Allman:>ME macros and learned a lot about

584
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Eric Allman:>NROFand TROF and typesetting.

585
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.280
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, I still have my,

586
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.840
<v Eric Allman:>you know, PICA ruler here and so

587
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.639
<v Eric Allman:>forth from when I was measuring stuff

588
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.140
<v Eric Allman:>out.

589
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.659
<v Eric Allman:>And yeah, it got used a lot

590
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.500
<v Eric Allman:>at Berkeley and did get distributed.

591
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Eric Allman:>You can still find it on pretty

592
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.720
<v Eric Allman:>much any Unix distribution, but mostly people

593
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.740
<v Eric Allman:>use other tools today.

594
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.300
<v Eric Allman:>So, you know, it was cool though.

595
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Eric Allman:>I think the best thing about it

596
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.400
<v Eric Allman:>was, so back then when students were

597
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Eric Allman:>getting their PhDs, they had to get

598
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.660
<v Eric Allman:>it typed up or, you know, we're

599
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Eric Allman:>starting to get to the point where

600
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.540
<v Eric Allman:>it's typeset.

601
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Eric Allman:>And it goes to the something graduate

602
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Eric Allman:>office.

603
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.940
<v Eric Allman:>And there's a woman there who like

604
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.680
<v Eric Allman:>pulls out a ruler and makes sure

605
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.899
<v Eric Allman:>all of the margins are exactly right

606
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.520
<v Eric Allman:>and so forth.

607
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Eric Allman:>And if they're not, she says, go

608
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.840
<v Eric Allman:>away, come back when you get it

609
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Eric Allman:>right.

610
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.580
<v Eric Allman:>She was called the Dragon Lady.

611
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Eric Allman:>And so I added in a macro

612
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Eric Allman:>called .th for thesis, and that just

613
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.360
<v Eric Allman:>set all the settings right so it

614
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.120
<v Eric Allman:>would get past the dragon lady.

615
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.140
<v Eric Allman:>And that made me a very popular

616
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Eric Allman:>guy.

617
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.480
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And you also wrote Trek, the Unix

618
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>version of Star Trek video game.

619
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Eric Allman:>Yes.

620
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Eric Allman:>It's not the first Trek version, although

621
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.260
<v Eric Allman:>I did make some enhancements.

622
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.920
<v Eric Allman:>There was one written in, I think

623
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Eric Allman:>it was Fortran, that somehow I came

624
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.600
<v Eric Allman:>across.

625
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.580
<v Eric Allman:>I think I must have played it

626
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Eric Allman:>somewhere at one point and said this

627
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Eric Allman:>is pretty cool but it should run

628
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.360
<v Eric Allman:>on the computer that I actually have

629
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.640
<v Eric Allman:>access to and so I started working

630
00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Eric Allman:>on writing track wasn't quite a port

631
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.240
<v Eric Allman:>of the old one because I did

632
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.700
<v Eric Allman:>start pretty much over from scratch and

633
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.500
<v Eric Allman:>that went on.

634
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.080
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I mentioned the kind of

635
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Eric Allman:>relaxed environment at the Ingress project.

636
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.920
<v Eric Allman:>It was relaxed enough that at some

637
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.320
<v Eric Allman:>point I got involved in Trek during

638
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Eric Allman:>a summer, and during the summer I

639
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.300
<v Eric Allman:>was paid for full-time instead of part-time,

640
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.980
<v Eric Allman:>and I spent basically all of my

641
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.240
<v Eric Allman:>full-time work working on Trek instead of

642
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Eric Allman:>on Ingress, which they should never have

643
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.860
<v Eric Allman:>let me get away with, but it

644
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.580
<v Eric Allman:>was fun.

645
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Eric Allman:>And there's an interesting story about Trek.

646
00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Eric Allman:>People were a lot more casual about

647
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Eric Allman:>privacy issues back then and Ken Thompson

648
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.680
<v Eric Allman:>had root super user access to every

649
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.360
<v Eric Allman:>Unix machine on campus.

650
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Eric Allman:>And it turns out that before he

651
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.860
<v Eric Allman:>went back to Bell labs, he made

652
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Eric Allman:>a tape of the entire system, including

653
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Eric Allman:>all everyone's personal files and so forth

654
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Eric Allman:>and took it with him.

655
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.580
<v Eric Allman:>And so one day I'm working in

656
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.560
<v Eric Allman:>my office at Ingress.

657
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.100
<v Eric Allman:>At that point I was, I had

658
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Eric Allman:>a private office because I was the

659
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.714
<v Eric Allman:>guy who did frontline support and can't

660
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.660
<v Eric Allman:>remember what my title was, but I

661
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.760
<v Eric Allman:>rated a private office and I got

662
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Eric Allman:>this phone call.

663
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Eric Allman:>And guy comes and says, Hi, I've

664
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.040
<v Eric Allman:>looked at your Trek program and it

665
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Eric Allman:>looks like it's not finished yet.

666
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.780
<v Eric Allman:>Did you abandon it?

667
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.440
<v Eric Allman:>And I went, no, I did not

668
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Eric Allman:>abandon it.

669
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>I didn't even know you had it.

670
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.639
<v Eric Allman:>Said, oh, well, Ken brought it back

671
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Eric Allman:>from Berkeley.

672
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.600
<v Eric Allman:>So I was in the middle of

673
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.680
<v Eric Allman:>developing it.

674
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.180
<v Eric Allman:>Anyway, He and I started communicating and

675
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Eric Allman:>sharing ideas and so forth.

676
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.500
<v Eric Allman:>That guy was named Steve Dorn, who

677
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Eric Allman:>is known for the Bourne shell and

678
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.340
<v Eric Allman:>several other things.

679
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Eric Allman:>So I'm still in contact with Steve.

680
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.520
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, he always called me because it

681
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Eric Allman:>was a long-distance call to New Jersey

682
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.139
<v Eric Allman:>and since he worked for the phone

683
00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.239
<v Eric Allman:>company he got free calls and we

684
00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.860
<v Eric Allman:>had very expensive calls.

685
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.980
<v Eric Allman:>So that was the arrangement.

686
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>In 1981, you had a summer job

687
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>at the International Institute for Applied Systems

688
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.279
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Analysis in Luxembourg, Austria, Europe as a

689
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.780
<v Elisabetta Mori:>consultant.

690
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you tell us more about this

691
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>experience?

692
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>How did you get this job?

693
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And what was your impression of Europe

694
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in the early 80s?

695
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.940
<v Eric Allman:>So there was a guy who was

696
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:21.320
<v Eric Allman:>a scientist mostly working on energy related

697
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.120
<v Eric Allman:>matters.

698
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Eric Allman:>Back before energy was a trendy thing

699
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.620
<v Eric Allman:>to work on.

700
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Eric Allman:>And he had done stints at IASA,

701
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.660
<v Eric Allman:>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, aka

702
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.320
<v Eric Allman:>YASA.

703
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.260
<v Eric Allman:>And there was a guy at YASA

704
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.180
<v Eric Allman:>who was trying to build a graphic

705
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Eric Allman:>system that the scientists could use.

706
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.380
<v Eric Allman:>And this is in the very early

707
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Eric Allman:>days of graphic interfaces, uh certainly wasn't

708
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.359
<v Eric Allman:>you know you go down to the

709
00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.100
<v Eric Allman:>corner store and buy yourself a Mac

710
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.300
<v Eric Allman:>or anything like that.

711
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Eric Allman:>So he had collected together all of

712
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Eric Allman:>this hardware and stuff to build it,

713
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.160
<v Eric Allman:>but they had never gotten it working.

714
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.839
<v Eric Allman:>And so somehow my friend Jerry was

715
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.859
<v Eric Allman:>able to get me an invitation to

716
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.220
<v Eric Allman:>come to do a summer at YASA

717
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Eric Allman:>that took time off from Berkeley and

718
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.100
<v Eric Allman:>went to build this thing called feds

719
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Eric Allman:>the front-end system, zystem I guess I

720
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Eric Allman:>don't know and I quickly found out

721
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.700
<v Eric Allman:>why this thing had never gotten working

722
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Eric Allman:>because every time I'd, you know, move

723
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.640
<v Eric Allman:>forward, the YASA guy would come and

724
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.759
<v Eric Allman:>say, oh, well, you know, you should

725
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Eric Allman:>put this in, it should add this

726
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.060
<v Eric Allman:>and so forth.

727
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Eric Allman:>So it was always like trying to

728
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Eric Allman:>do more and I was just trying

729
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Eric Allman:>to get it to work.

730
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Eric Allman:>And so he and I ended up,

731
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.220
<v Eric Allman:>I guess, not really getting along all

732
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.220
<v Eric Allman:>that well, because I said no.

733
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.160
<v Eric Allman:>And I said, you know, I'm going

734
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Eric Allman:>to get this to work.

735
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Eric Allman:>And by God, at the end of

736
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.700
<v Eric Allman:>the summer, it worked.

737
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.160
<v Eric Allman:>It didn't work well, it didn't work

738
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Eric Allman:>fancy, it wasn't user-friendly, It wasn't something

739
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.040
<v Eric Allman:>that the scientists could actually use, but

740
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Eric Allman:>it did work.

741
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.660
<v Eric Allman:>And the other thing that was interesting

742
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.866
<v Eric Allman:>about that job was, it was, the

743
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.799
<v Eric Allman:>Institute itself was in a palace, one

744
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Eric Allman:>of Maria Theresa's summer palaces.

745
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Eric Allman:>And my office had been friends of

746
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:50.780
<v Eric Allman:>Joseph's library and big, huge glass doors

747
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.000
<v Eric Allman:>all around the outside of the building

748
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.379
<v Eric Allman:>so I could just walk through that

749
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.900
<v Eric Allman:>door and I'd be in a I

750
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.020
<v Eric Allman:>think it was 40 hectare park and

751
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.640
<v Eric Allman:>wander around if I wanted to stop

752
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Eric Allman:>and think about something.

753
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.900
<v Eric Allman:>And there was a castle in the

754
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.120
<v Eric Allman:>middle of the park that was built

755
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.759
<v Eric Allman:>for Marie Antoinette as a dollhouse, but,

756
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.340
<v Eric Allman:>you know, life-sized dollhouse.

757
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Eric Allman:>She could walk into it.

758
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.880
<v Eric Allman:>And another interesting thing about YASA was

759
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.479
<v Eric Allman:>it was, I think at that time,

760
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.620
<v Eric Allman:>the only scientific institute in the world

761
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.620
<v Eric Allman:>that had people both from the Soviet

762
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.420
<v Eric Allman:>Union and from Western governments.

763
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.540
<v Eric Allman:>So I got to know some of

764
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Eric Allman:>the Soviets there and learned that a

765
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.160
<v Eric Allman:>lot of the stuff I'd been taught

766
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Eric Allman:>in school maybe not have been completely

767
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Eric Allman:>accurate.

768
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.560
<v Eric Allman:>Like these were people who, one guy

769
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.279
<v Eric Allman:>was very concerned because his wife had

770
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.580
<v Eric Allman:>to go to the hospital and she

771
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Eric Allman:>wasn't with him, she was back in

772
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Eric Allman:>Soviet Union.

773
00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Eric Allman:>And just the outpouring of, you know,

774
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.800
<v Eric Allman:>I can't really say love, but concern

775
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Eric Allman:>for him, made it very clear to

776
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Eric Allman:>me that most people in Russia just

777
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.060
<v Eric Allman:>want to live their lives kind of

778
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.680
<v Eric Allman:>like we do and that was a

779
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.620
<v Eric Allman:>good thing for me to learn.

780
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.319
<v Eric Allman:>And there was a Polish guy who

781
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.420
<v Eric Allman:>was involved with the, what was the

782
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Eric Allman:>union, solidarity.

783
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Eric Allman:>I actually have a solidarity union pin

784
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.180
<v Eric Allman:>around here somewhere.

785
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Eric Allman:>And we had United Nations access, so

786
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.820
<v Eric Allman:>I had access to the UN commissary,

787
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.439
<v Eric Allman:>and everything was tax free, and all

788
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.040
<v Eric Allman:>over the world, and so forth.

789
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.759
<v Eric Allman:>It was just a splendid summer, I

790
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.660
<v Eric Allman:>have to say.

791
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.839
<v Eric Allman:>It was also my first time in

792
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.320
<v Eric Allman:>Europe, and so it's been kind of

793
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.280
<v Eric Allman:>disappointing ever since to not be in

794
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.100
<v Eric Allman:>something quite that exciting, but I love

795
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.940
<v Eric Allman:>Europe anyway.

796
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.560
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Did you travel around Europe when you

797
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.300
<v Elisabetta Mori:>were there?

798
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>That's right.

799
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Eric Allman:>No, I did not.

800
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.640
<v Eric Allman:>I certainly have traveled a fair amount

801
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Eric Allman:>since, but at that point, I remember

802
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.800
<v Eric Allman:>I was taking leave from work and

803
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.220
<v Eric Allman:>so forth.

804
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.640
<v Eric Allman:>So I kind of had to get

805
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Eric Allman:>back.

806
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:27.660
<v Eric Allman:>And I was in a relationship then.

807
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.940
<v Eric Allman:>In fact, the relationship I'm still in.

808
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.060
<v Eric Allman:>And so I wanted to get back

809
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.560
<v Eric Allman:>home and be able to cuddle with

810
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.260
<v Eric Allman:>my honey.

811
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So you were back home and in

812
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>November 1981, you joined Britton Lee, Pioneering

813
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.220
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Relational Database Company.

814
00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.759
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So I have the feeling that some

815
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of your colleagues at Berkeley invited you

816
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:04.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>there?

817
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:05.820
<v Eric Allman:>Very true.

818
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Eric Allman:>Yes, Britton Lee was a Ingress spin-off,

819
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.120
<v Eric Allman:>kind of an interesting, maybe a little

820
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.800
<v Eric Allman:>schizophrenic company.

821
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.560
<v Eric Allman:>The people who founded it were hardware

822
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.400
<v Eric Allman:>guys and so they wanted to build

823
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.420
<v Eric Allman:>a special-purpose computer that would run database

824
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Eric Allman:>applications.

825
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Eric Allman:>And they didn't realize that the secret

826
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.060
<v Eric Allman:>sauce in the database system is not

827
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Eric Allman:>the hardware, it's the software.

828
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.680
<v Eric Allman:>So there was a software group in

829
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.780
<v Eric Allman:>Berkeley, even though most of the company

830
00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Eric Allman:>was in Los Gatos.

831
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.560
<v Eric Allman:>And I got hired in initially to

832
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.680
<v Eric Allman:>manage the, what was called the host

833
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Eric Allman:>software group, which is to say the

834
00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Eric Allman:>things that run on your computers that

835
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.859
<v Eric Allman:>talk to the database computer, we call

836
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Eric Allman:>it a database machine.

837
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.480
<v Eric Allman:>Then it was really one of the

838
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.480
<v Eric Allman:>first cases of client-server, so it was

839
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.040
<v Eric Allman:>really a database server, but that's not

840
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.400
<v Eric Allman:>what the word was back then.

841
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.540
<v Eric Allman:>And so all of the user interfaces

842
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.500
<v Eric Allman:>that people would use, which was mostly

843
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Eric Allman:>programmatic interfaces.

844
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.780
<v Eric Allman:>And I kind of got a group

845
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.920
<v Eric Allman:>together And one of the best hires

846
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.299
<v Eric Allman:>I've ever made, in fact, was a

847
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.080
<v Eric Allman:>guy named Greg Olson, who I'll talk

848
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.460
<v Eric Allman:>about later some more.

849
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.339
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, we were doing some

850
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.060
<v Eric Allman:>good work, But I was having, this

851
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.240
<v Eric Allman:>was my first management job and I

852
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.660
<v Eric Allman:>did not particularly like management jobs.

853
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.340
<v Eric Allman:>So at some point I went to

854
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Eric Allman:>my boss and I said, I wanna

855
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.860
<v Eric Allman:>go back to being an engineer, way

856
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.200
<v Eric Allman:>better at it than I am being

857
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:01.820
<v Eric Allman:>a manager.

858
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.899
<v Eric Allman:>And you know I'd like to do

859
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.520
<v Eric Allman:>it here and work on this stuff

860
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Eric Allman:>but you know if you can't do

861
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Eric Allman:>that I'll find another job.

862
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.760
<v Eric Allman:>And to his credit, he didn't say,

863
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.320
<v Eric Allman:>well, bye, see you later.

864
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.980
<v Eric Allman:>He, in fact, did put me down

865
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Eric Allman:>to being a wine engineer again.

866
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Eric Allman:>And by the way, did not cut

867
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.300
<v Eric Allman:>my salary amazingly.

868
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.200
<v Eric Allman:>And but the flip side is he

869
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.760
<v Eric Allman:>took this guy, Greg Olson, who was

870
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.800
<v Eric Allman:>my best engineer and made him my

871
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Eric Allman:>boss.

872
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.760
<v Eric Allman:>And I've always wondered if he wasn't

873
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Eric Allman:>doing that in the hopes that I

874
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.879
<v Eric Allman:>would find that such an insult that

875
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Eric Allman:>I would quit.

876
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.759
<v Eric Allman:>Um, but in fact, Greg was the

877
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.720
<v Eric Allman:>perfect boss.

878
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.379
<v Eric Allman:>I mean, like day one, he came

879
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Eric Allman:>in and said, Eric, you're a way

880
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.620
<v Eric Allman:>better programmer than I'll ever be.

881
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.919
<v Eric Allman:>So how about, you know, we kind

882
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.620
<v Eric Allman:>of do this together and you manage

883
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.140
<v Eric Allman:>the technology and I'll manage management.

884
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Eric Allman:>And it worked great.

885
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.380
<v Eric Allman:>Really worked well.

886
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.240
<v Eric Allman:>I ended up doing a system there.

887
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.600
<v Eric Allman:>Um, basically I came to the conclusion

888
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.840
<v Eric Allman:>that it was too hard to build

889
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Eric Allman:>database applications and there was no reason

890
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Eric Allman:>the database application had to be really

891
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.440
<v Eric Allman:>difficult.

892
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.394
<v Eric Allman:>So I built a system called ADIT,

893
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.680
<v Eric Allman:>Advanced Database Interface Tools, that included a

894
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.220
<v Eric Allman:>graphic component so that you could actually

895
00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Eric Allman:>do stuff that you couldn't do on

896
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.360
<v Eric Allman:>the Fez system back in Austria.

897
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.100
<v Eric Allman:>But I got it to the point

898
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.780
<v Eric Allman:>where it was prototyped.

899
00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.420
<v Eric Allman:>Still needed a lot of work.

900
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.940
<v Eric Allman:>But it was getting to the point

901
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.440
<v Eric Allman:>where it became clear that we were

902
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.180
<v Eric Allman:>going to need marketing support.

903
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.660
<v Eric Allman:>And so we did a big all

904
00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.480
<v Eric Allman:>day demo.

905
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.060
<v Eric Allman:>VP of marketing came up to Berkeley,

906
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.860
<v Eric Allman:>we gave him, you know, this big

907
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.279
<v Eric Allman:>tour, showed him all the stuff it

908
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.040
<v Eric Allman:>could do.

909
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.440
<v Eric Allman:>And at the end of the day,

910
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Eric Allman:>he said, you know, you engineers always,

911
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.319
<v Eric Allman:>you just have your heads in the

912
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.820
<v Eric Allman:>clouds.

913
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Eric Allman:>People don't want these.

914
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.380
<v Eric Allman:>You're using Sun workstations, which are kind

915
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.360
<v Eric Allman:>of expensive at the time, I suppose.

916
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Eric Allman:>People don't want workstations.

917
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.180
<v Eric Allman:>They're way too expensive.

918
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.020
<v Eric Allman:>They want PC applications.

919
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.220
<v Eric Allman:>They want text-only PC applications, because graphics

920
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.660
<v Eric Allman:>wasn't big on the PC.

921
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.400
<v Eric Allman:>And after I picked my job off

922
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.020
<v Eric Allman:>the floor, best I could come up

923
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Eric Allman:>with is they will be asking for

924
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.520
<v Eric Allman:>it.

925
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.020
<v Eric Allman:>But he was like, no, no marketing

926
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.419
<v Eric Allman:>resources are going to go to this

927
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:51.760
<v Eric Allman:>at all.

928
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.200
<v Eric Allman:>And that's when I realized I had

929
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.919
<v Eric Allman:>to shut down the project, which I

930
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.520
<v Eric Allman:>did over, you know, sort of cleaned

931
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Eric Allman:>it all up, documented it in the

932
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.240
<v Eric Allman:>hopes that somebody would come along and

933
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.400
<v Eric Allman:>revise it when they finally figured out

934
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.500
<v Eric Allman:>what was important.

935
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.440
<v Eric Allman:>This is part of the thing where

936
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.899
<v Eric Allman:>Britton Lee was a hardware company, not

937
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.980
<v Eric Allman:>a software company.

938
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.180
<v Eric Allman:>What I was doing was software and

939
00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.760
<v Eric Allman:>hence not valuable.

940
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:23.620
<v Eric Allman:>And I ended up meeting up with

941
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Eric Allman:>a friend of mine who had been

942
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.400
<v Eric Allman:>a grad student when I was at

943
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.919
<v Eric Allman:>Berkeley, and he was working at a

944
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Eric Allman:>new place called the International Computer Science

945
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Eric Allman:>Institute, ICSI.

946
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.027
<v Eric Allman:>And so I jumped from Britton Lee

947
00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Eric Allman:>to ICSI, which was an easy jump

948
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Eric Allman:>to do because they were a block

949
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.080
<v Eric Allman:>apart in Berkeley.

950
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.240
<v Eric Allman:>Didn't have to rent a truck or

951
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Eric Allman:>anything.

952
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.100
<v Eric Allman:>And am I getting too far ahead

953
00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:57.600
<v Eric Allman:>here?

954
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>That's perfect.

955
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Yeah, yeah, no.

956
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So that was in 88 when you

957
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>joined the speech group at the International

958
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Computer Science Institute, right?

959
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Eric Allman:>Sounds about right.

960
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Eric Allman:>I have to look at my resume.

961
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.840
<v Eric Allman:>I'm not very good on remembering dates.

962
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.540
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, Morgan, who was known then just

963
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.600
<v Eric Allman:>as Morgan, his full name was actually

964
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Eric Allman:>Nelson Morgan, had been working on digital

965
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.960
<v Eric Allman:>audio as a grad student in electrical

966
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Eric Allman:>engineering.

967
00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Eric Allman:>And he got his PhD and he

968
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.800
<v Eric Allman:>went to ICSE.

969
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.940
<v Eric Allman:>He developed an interest in speech recognition

970
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.540
<v Eric Allman:>and so he started up a group

971
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Eric Allman:>which was called the Realization Group.

972
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.840
<v Eric Allman:>There were a bunch of little groups

973
00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Eric Allman:>inside of ICSE.

974
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.620
<v Eric Allman:>It was funded by the German government,

975
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.379
<v Eric Allman:>although it was associated with Berkeley, so

976
00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.500
<v Eric Allman:>we had access to Berkeley networks and

977
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.580
<v Eric Allman:>things, but we didn't get a Berkeley

978
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.080
<v Eric Allman:>paycheck.

979
00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.640
<v Eric Allman:>And I had what is undoubtedly the

980
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.319
<v Eric Allman:>most spectacular office I have ever had

981
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.180
<v Eric Allman:>in my career.

982
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Eric Allman:>It was huge.

983
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Eric Allman:>You could probably play basketball in it.

984
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.800
<v Eric Allman:>Nice job.

985
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Eric Allman:>But So the point of ICSI, Jerry

986
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.140
<v Eric Allman:>Feldman, who was the director of the

987
00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.760
<v Eric Allman:>Institute, was a lot on these things

988
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.860
<v Eric Allman:>called neural networks.

989
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Eric Allman:>And neural networks had been a thing

990
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.180
<v Eric Allman:>back in the 60s and then had

991
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Eric Allman:>kind of fallen out of favor.

992
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.840
<v Eric Allman:>And he wanted to make this institute

993
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.840
<v Eric Allman:>working on what, neural networks, which were

994
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.180
<v Eric Allman:>kind of a form of artificial intelligence.

995
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.540
<v Eric Allman:>Now we call them deep learning and

996
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.180
<v Eric Allman:>it's the big rage right now.

997
00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Eric Allman:>But back then hardware was limited And

998
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Eric Allman:>so I was in a group that

999
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Eric Allman:>was part hardware, part software.

1000
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.640
<v Eric Allman:>And the hardware folks built a thing

1001
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.960
<v Eric Allman:>called the ring array processor, which was

1002
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:17.720
<v Eric Allman:>a unusual architecture because the communication paths

1003
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.339
<v Eric Allman:>could only go to the left or

1004
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.759
<v Eric Allman:>to the right but couldn't go to

1005
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.720
<v Eric Allman:>an arbitrary another node so a whole

1006
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.340
<v Eric Allman:>bunch of computers in a box and

1007
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.260
<v Eric Allman:>it turns out that was a great

1008
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:35.180
<v Eric Allman:>architecture for doing neural networks and I

1009
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.850
<v Eric Allman:>was writing software for it and I

1010
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.560
<v Eric Allman:>actually didn't stay too long at ICSI

1011
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.440
<v Eric Allman:>because it turns out that my job

1012
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.860
<v Eric Allman:>was, let's look at, you know, eight

1013
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.600
<v Eric Allman:>lines of assembly language and see if

1014
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.900
<v Eric Allman:>we can get that down to seven

1015
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.180
<v Eric Allman:>lines of assembly language.

1016
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.560
<v Eric Allman:>And if that takes a month, so

1017
00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.300
<v Eric Allman:>be it.

1018
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, it was interesting.

1019
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.040
<v Eric Allman:>I learned a lot about learning algorithms

1020
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.379
<v Eric Allman:>and things like that.

1021
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.000
<v Eric Allman:>I still have, you know, books on

1022
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.960
<v Eric Allman:>my shelf from back then.

1023
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.480
<v Eric Allman:>So, and I get to say, I

1024
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Eric Allman:>actually did the deep learning stuff back

1025
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.740
<v Eric Allman:>before it was popular, but didn't really

1026
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Eric Allman:>spend a lot of time at it.

1027
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Eric Allman:>Nonetheless, it was fun doing something new.

1028
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.880
<v Eric Allman:>It's been a theme through my career.

1029
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.060
<v Eric Allman:>Some people say, okay, I'm going to

1030
00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.799
<v Eric Allman:>work on this, and they figure that

1031
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Eric Allman:>out in grad school and they spend

1032
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.566
<v Eric Allman:>their entire career working on that and

1033
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Eric Allman:>I'm the sort of person who every

1034
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.919
<v Eric Allman:>five years or so gets bored and

1035
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.820
<v Eric Allman:>says I want to do something completely

1036
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.743
<v Eric Allman:>different And that was completely different.

1037
00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.339
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So in 1989 you moved back to

1038
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.500
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the University of California Berkeley as the

1039
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>lead programmer on the Mammoth project.

1040
00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:57.920
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah.

1041
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What was the Mammoth project?

1042
00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.260
<v Eric Allman:>So Mammoth was an infrastructure group.

1043
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Eric Allman:>At that time, Berkeley was...

1044
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:17.319
<v Eric Allman:>if you had a project where you

1045
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.299
<v Eric Allman:>were using a computer, and at that

1046
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Eric Allman:>point pretty much everyone was on Unix.

1047
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.880
<v Eric Allman:>You had your own computer and your

1048
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.100
<v Eric Allman:>own system administrator, and you managed your

1049
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.200
<v Eric Allman:>own machine, and everyone tended to customize

1050
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.200
<v Eric Allman:>their own software.

1051
00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.399
<v Eric Allman:>And it was starting to become a

1052
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.900
<v Eric Allman:>problem because two groups would talk to

1053
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Eric Allman:>each other and say "oh, you know

1054
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.439
<v Eric Allman:>we're doing stuff that would really fit

1055
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.520
<v Eric Allman:>together nicely" and then discover they couldn't

1056
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.780
<v Eric Allman:>fit them together because they or use

1057
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.660
<v Eric Allman:>different versions of the compiler or something.

1058
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:57.240
<v Eric Allman:>And so, um, a professor, Susan Graham,

1059
00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:02.860
<v Eric Allman:>um, became the PI on the Mammoth

1060
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.360
<v Eric Allman:>project.

1061
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Eric Allman:>And the idea was we got an

1062
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.759
<v Eric Allman:>actually really big grant to install and

1063
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Eric Allman:>manage infrastructure.

1064
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Eric Allman:>And so we had a CM5 from

1065
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.480
<v Eric Allman:>Thinking Machines, which was a parallel computer

1066
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Eric Allman:>at that point, which I don't quite

1067
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.440
<v Eric Allman:>know how they talked thinking machines into

1068
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.560
<v Eric Allman:>letting them have one for a fraction

1069
00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.180
<v Eric Allman:>of the price because these things...

1070
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Eric Allman:>so there's at the end of the

1071
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Eric Allman:>rack there's a panel filled with blinking

1072
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:47.140
<v Eric Allman:>lights and you've seen it in Jurassic

1073
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.799
<v Eric Allman:>Park because in the scene where the

1074
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.100
<v Eric Allman:>girl goes into the machine room and

1075
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Eric Allman:>goes "Oh, this is Unix.

1076
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.013
<v Eric Allman:>I know how to use this." The

1077
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.259
<v Eric Allman:>machine was actually a CM5 and in

1078
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.180
<v Eric Allman:>fact the guy who maintained our machine

1079
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Eric Allman:>was the one who installed that on

1080
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Eric Allman:>the set.

1081
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Eric Allman:>And it turns out there were no

1082
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.140
<v Eric Allman:>processors at all in that box.

1083
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.280
<v Eric Allman:>The lights flashing, there was a separate

1084
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Eric Allman:>processor just to blink the lights.

1085
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.900
<v Eric Allman:>It did absolutely nothing.

1086
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Eric Allman:>And so they had an empty box.

1087
00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.100
<v Eric Allman:>We had a box with a few

1088
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Eric Allman:>things in it.

1089
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Eric Allman:>And that machine, that panel was so

1090
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.780
<v Eric Allman:>heavy that it took two people to

1091
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Eric Allman:>lift it up.

1092
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.899
<v Eric Allman:>It was just, the machine was a

1093
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:45.040
<v Eric Allman:>disaster in terms of actually being usable

1094
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Eric Allman:>and maintainable and so forth.

1095
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.980
<v Eric Allman:>Anyway, that was one of the things.

1096
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.020
<v Eric Allman:>Another one was a compute machine.

1097
00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Eric Allman:>This is back in the time when

1098
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.299
<v Eric Allman:>people are starting to say maybe this

1099
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.620
<v Eric Allman:>parallel processing stuff is a good idea.

1100
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:10.279
<v Eric Allman:>And so they got a, oh, come

1101
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.640
<v Eric Allman:>on, it was running RISC-OS.

1102
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.319
<v Eric Allman:>It was a, I can't remember the

1103
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.799
<v Eric Allman:>manufacturer now, but I think it was

1104
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.859
<v Eric Allman:>the 32 processor system, which was about

1105
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.980
<v Eric Allman:>the biggest you could get back then.

1106
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:24.400
<v Eric Allman:>And the third one was a disk

1107
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Eric Allman:>server, which we got from another company.

1108
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.040
<v Eric Allman:>And the idea was people could get

1109
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.020
<v Eric Allman:>time, counts, whatever, on any of these

1110
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:39.520
<v Eric Allman:>resources.

1111
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.779
<v Eric Allman:>And that way they wouldn't have to

1112
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.560
<v Eric Allman:>manage the machines themselves.

1113
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.680
<v Eric Allman:>So on the disk servers we built

1114
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.080
<v Eric Allman:>something called the software warehouse, which basically

1115
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Eric Allman:>said, let's find all the interesting software

1116
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.799
<v Eric Allman:>that anyone might wanna use, we'll put

1117
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.680
<v Eric Allman:>it in one place, it'll be shared

1118
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.000
<v Eric Allman:>through the whole department, we will maintain

1119
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:02.520
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1120
00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.939
<v Eric Allman:>And so all of these people who

1121
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.700
<v Eric Allman:>have been spending all their time doing

1122
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.220
<v Eric Allman:>system administration can actually do real research.

1123
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.460
<v Eric Allman:>And it was incredibly successful.

1124
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.180
<v Eric Allman:>And at a group there, at that

1125
00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.819
<v Eric Allman:>point, I was a manager again, but

1126
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.660
<v Eric Allman:>I was getting to be better at

1127
00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.940
<v Eric Allman:>it And I had been in my

1128
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:30.940
<v Eric Allman:>first management job and yeah, it was

1129
00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Eric Allman:>kind of changed the whole culture in

1130
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.800
<v Eric Allman:>the department.

1131
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Eric Allman:>So I was a very popular guy

1132
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.540
<v Eric Allman:>in the department for a while.

1133
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.140
<v Eric Allman:>But the problem with the mammoth project

1134
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.160
<v Eric Allman:>is it had gotten to the point

1135
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Eric Allman:>where it was starting to become a,

1136
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Eric Allman:>okay, just keep things running.

1137
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.220
<v Eric Allman:>And so it was a maintenance job.

1138
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Eric Allman:>And I was, like I said, every

1139
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Eric Allman:>five years I get itchy.

1140
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Eric Allman:>And so I got itchy and decided

1141
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:05.720
<v Eric Allman:>to leave.

1142
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And that was 1995.

1143
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah.

1144
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.360
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You joined in reference.

1145
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.700
<v Eric Allman:>Yes, well, there's twice in my life

1146
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.900
<v Eric Allman:>where I've taken jobs that were really

1147
00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Eric Allman:>a mistake.

1148
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Eric Allman:>And I think that was one of

1149
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Eric Allman:>them.

1150
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Eric Allman:>It looked kind of cool.

1151
00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.200
<v Eric Allman:>But first of all, it was in

1152
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Eric Allman:>Sunnyvale, so I had to commute from

1153
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.920
<v Eric Allman:>Berkeley, which was, I don't like to

1154
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Eric Allman:>drive, and so that was terrible.

1155
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.760
<v Eric Allman:>But the other thing was, the guy

1156
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Eric Allman:>who founded it turns out didn't seem

1157
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.279
<v Eric Allman:>to know what the product was that

1158
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Eric Allman:>he was trying to build.

1159
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.800
<v Eric Allman:>And so every time I was the

1160
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.940
<v Eric Allman:>chief technology officer and at that point

1161
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.319
<v Eric Allman:>I had kind of a name so

1162
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.720
<v Eric Allman:>he always wanted to strut me out

1163
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.620
<v Eric Allman:>to show people that we had this

1164
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.660
<v Eric Allman:>techie guy on his staff and I

1165
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.800
<v Eric Allman:>learned to keep my mouth shut until

1166
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Eric Allman:>I found out what the product was

1167
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.547
<v Eric Allman:>today.

1168
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.920
<v Eric Allman:>And then I had to ad lib

1169
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.420
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1170
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.940
<v Eric Allman:>So that was just kind of a

1171
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.440
<v Eric Allman:>disaster.

1172
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.940
<v Eric Allman:>And I ended up leaving that.

1173
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.740
<v Eric Allman:>It ended up getting sold off to

1174
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.940
<v Eric Allman:>another place which was an internet ad

1175
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.700
<v Eric Allman:>company.

1176
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.720
<v Eric Allman:>So in reference turned into an internet

1177
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Eric Allman:>ad company but that was after I

1178
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.100
<v Eric Allman:>left.

1179
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.540
<v Eric Allman:>Trust me I wouldn't do that to

1180
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.040
<v Eric Allman:>you.

1181
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what happened when you left in

1182
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>reference?

1183
00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:58.300
<v Eric Allman:>Well, that was a painful experience, both

1184
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.379
<v Eric Allman:>between the commute and the uncertainty of

1185
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.920
<v Eric Allman:>the job and so forth.

1186
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:06.140
<v Eric Allman:>So I realized I had enough money

1187
00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.600
<v Eric Allman:>in the bank that I could probably

1188
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.000
<v Eric Allman:>survive for six months without too much

1189
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Eric Allman:>trouble.

1190
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.560
<v Eric Allman:>And so I was basically acting as

1191
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Eric Allman:>a consultant and I was working on

1192
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Eric Allman:>I wrote, co-authored a book on send

1193
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:24.874
<v Eric Allman:>mail.

1194
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.520
<v Eric Allman:>That was during that time I did

1195
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:35.720
<v Eric Allman:>some other well, I did other consulting

1196
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.720
<v Eric Allman:>a big one there being a company

1197
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:47.600
<v Eric Allman:>that wanted to do mass mailing, which,

1198
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.020
<v Eric Allman:>you know, now everyone has this, but

1199
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.080
<v Eric Allman:>back then it was a new thing.

1200
00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:56.640
<v Eric Allman:>Anyway, I was here in Berkeley, down

1201
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Eric Allman:>at Pete's, which is two blocks from

1202
00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.760
<v Eric Allman:>my house getting coffee.

1203
00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.520
<v Eric Allman:>And who did I run into but

1204
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.740
<v Eric Allman:>Greg Olson, same guy I'd worked with

1205
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.581
<v Eric Allman:>at Britton Lee.

1206
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.120
<v Eric Allman:>And you know, I'd had in the

1207
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.320
<v Eric Allman:>back of my head a thing of,

1208
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Eric Allman:>well, maybe I could get some companies

1209
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Eric Allman:>together and create a consortium that, you

1210
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.200
<v Eric Allman:>know, they'd each give me a small

1211
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Eric Allman:>amount of money to develop and maintain

1212
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Eric Allman:>Sendmail.

1213
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Eric Allman:>I could hire somebody to do the

1214
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.700
<v Eric Allman:>frontline support, which was taking up more

1215
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Eric Allman:>and more of my time.

1216
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.060
<v Eric Allman:>You know, free email consulting.

1217
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.440
<v Eric Allman:>I was spending half my day every

1218
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.600
<v Eric Allman:>day just answering mail, most of which

1219
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Eric Allman:>was, see this page.

1220
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.380
<v Eric Allman:>It's documented, look it up.

1221
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.340
<v Eric Allman:>So I had gone to some couple

1222
00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Eric Allman:>other places and the general attitude seemed

1223
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.359
<v Eric Allman:>to be, yeah, we would fund you

1224
00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.160
<v Eric Allman:>for that as long as we own

1225
00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:57.660
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1226
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:58.780
<v Eric Allman:>And I'm

1227
00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.240
<v Eric Allman:>like, no, that's not the point.

1228
01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.480
<v Eric Allman:>Point is, if ownership is spread out

1229
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Eric Allman:>and nobody would go for that and

1230
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.560
<v Eric Allman:>so Greg at that point had gone

1231
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.440
<v Eric Allman:>stayed on the management route and he

1232
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.240
<v Eric Allman:>had been you know VP of marketing,

1233
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.020
<v Eric Allman:>and VP of engineering and VP of

1234
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.220
<v Eric Allman:>sales and so forth.

1235
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.900
<v Eric Allman:>So you had all of these, this

1236
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.060
<v Eric Allman:>background and how companies actually work.

1237
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.359
<v Eric Allman:>And I told him about this and

1238
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Eric Allman:>he said, you know, I'm between jobs

1239
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.779
<v Eric Allman:>right now and I'm kind of doing

1240
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.899
<v Eric Allman:>business consulting and I'll help you write

1241
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.900
<v Eric Allman:>a business plan.

1242
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.840
<v Eric Allman:>You could do a company, you know,

1243
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.340
<v Eric Allman:>just a standalone company.

1244
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Eric Allman:>And so we spent that summer working

1245
01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.573
<v Eric Allman:>on a business plan.

1246
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Eric Allman:>And when the whole thing came together,

1247
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Eric Allman:>I basically said, I'll give you half

1248
01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Eric Allman:>the company if you'd be my CEO.

1249
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Eric Allman:>And so he did that and was

1250
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.740
<v Eric Allman:>a really great CEO.

1251
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.780
<v Eric Allman:>And yeah, it was pretty heady.

1252
01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.440
<v Eric Allman:>We made the front page of the

1253
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.040
<v Eric Allman:>New York Times when we announced the

1254
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.540
<v Eric Allman:>company.

1255
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.100
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So that was in March 1998.

1256
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.520
<v Eric Allman:>Yes, that's right.

1257
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Eric Allman:>It was.

1258
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.060
<v Eric Allman:>I was thinking it was earlier, but

1259
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.600
<v Eric Allman:>no, that's right.

1260
01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:39.100
<v Eric Allman:>So you know, we, SendMail had a

1261
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.640
<v Eric Allman:>reputation for being difficult to configure so

1262
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.200
<v Eric Allman:>our first thing was we'll make it

1263
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.360
<v Eric Allman:>easy to configure and using a graphic

1264
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Eric Allman:>user interface and so forth.

1265
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.339
<v Eric Allman:>And, well, I could go through the

1266
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:58.140
<v Eric Allman:>whole history of SendMail, but probably it's

1267
01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.799
<v Eric Allman:>only of interest to three people in

1268
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.060
<v Eric Allman:>the world.

1269
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.319
<v Eric Allman:>So, if there's anything in particular you're

1270
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Eric Allman:>interested in.

1271
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>The evolution of the company, when you

1272
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.160
<v Elisabetta Mori:>founded it, and what happened eventually.

1273
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.420
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And what were the key events?

1274
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.960
<v Eric Allman:>So I was Chief Technology Officer.

1275
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.760
<v Eric Allman:>I was acting as VP of engineering

1276
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.540
<v Eric Allman:>at first but we had to get

1277
01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Eric Allman:>another VP of engineering because two things

1278
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.819
<v Eric Allman:>actually one was part of VP of

1279
01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.419
<v Eric Allman:>engineering is doing budgets and things like

1280
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.940
<v Eric Allman:>that which was not something that really

1281
01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
<v Eric Allman:>got me excited.

1282
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.020
<v Eric Allman:>But the other thing was, and this

1283
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.520
<v Eric Allman:>is probably a mistake I made at

1284
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Eric Allman:>Sendmail, the marketing department at that point,

1285
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.040
<v Eric Allman:>I really had a reputation.

1286
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.060
<v Eric Allman:>So the marketing department wanted to, you

1287
01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.279
<v Eric Allman:>know, bring me out to speak in

1288
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.399
<v Eric Allman:>front of customers and stuff, you know,

1289
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.880
<v Eric Allman:>at conferences, etc.

1290
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Eric Allman:>So, I ended up flying all over

1291
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.240
<v Eric Allman:>the world, meeting customers.

1292
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Eric Allman:>There was one time when I had

1293
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Eric Allman:>been in Europe for, you know, probably

1294
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.100
<v Eric Allman:>four or five different countries in Europe,

1295
01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.259
<v Eric Allman:>had to fly back to Berkeley for

1296
01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.960
<v Eric Allman:>some meeting or event, and the very

1297
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.440
<v Eric Allman:>next day flew to Japan.

1298
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.060
<v Eric Allman:>So it was kind of grueling.

1299
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Eric Allman:>And so I ended up doing more

1300
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.680
<v Eric Allman:>marketing actually than technology, which kind of

1301
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.760
<v Eric Allman:>bummed me out.

1302
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.580
<v Eric Allman:>We did get some important things done

1303
01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:58.940
<v Eric Allman:>here.

1304
01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Eric Allman:>We came up with the Miltur interface,

1305
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.280
<v Eric Allman:>stood for mail filter.

1306
01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.799
<v Eric Allman:>And that was a way to do

1307
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.460
<v Eric Allman:>plugins into SendMail to do mail filtering,

1308
01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.120
<v Eric Allman:>which can be arbitrary, but of course

1309
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.040
<v Eric Allman:>the big thing back then was anti-spam.

1310
01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.340
<v Eric Allman:>Spam was becoming a really serious problem.

1311
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.560
<v Eric Allman:>The milter interface was very successful to

1312
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.040
<v Eric Allman:>the extent that other MTAs that are

1313
01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.000
<v Eric Allman:>out there are compatible with the SendMail

1314
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Eric Allman:>milters.

1315
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.339
<v Eric Allman:>And I worked on some standards for

1316
01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.280
<v Eric Allman:>the IETF, the Internet Engineering Task Force,

1317
01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Eric Allman:>which sets the standards for the Internet.

1318
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.620
<v Eric Allman:>In particular one called DKIM, Domain Keys

1319
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.780
<v Eric Allman:>Identified Mail.

1320
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Eric Allman:>I...

1321
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.340
<v Eric Allman:>The standards process is an interesting one.

1322
01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Eric Allman:>And I ended up, I did that

1323
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Eric Allman:>and then decided I didn't wanna do

1324
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.300
<v Eric Allman:>standards anymore just because it was tedious.

1325
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Eric Allman:>And there were some people there who

1326
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.500
<v Eric Allman:>were very, very difficult to work with,

1327
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.120
<v Eric Allman:>and you couldn't get rid of them.

1328
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.560
<v Eric Allman:>So that was the end of my

1329
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.580
<v Eric Allman:>standards career.

1330
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.200
<v Eric Allman:>And then, this is gonna sound a

1331
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.160
<v Eric Allman:>little bizarre, but one of my lucky

1332
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Eric Allman:>breaks was I was diagnosed with prostate

1333
01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Eric Allman:>cancer.

1334
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.080
<v Eric Allman:>And I know you don't think of

1335
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.600
<v Eric Allman:>that as a lucky break, but I

1336
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.440
<v Eric Allman:>was 51, 52, I think then.

1337
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.600
<v Eric Allman:>And so I decided I would have

1338
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Eric Allman:>surgery.

1339
01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Eric Allman:>And there was, of course, a recovery

1340
01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Eric Allman:>period from surgery.

1341
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.880
<v Eric Allman:>And so I ended up taking some

1342
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.720
<v Eric Allman:>time off and eventually went to part

1343
01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.220
<v Eric Allman:>time.

1344
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Eric Allman:>And that got me a little bit

1345
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:07.500
<v Eric Allman:>away and you know, I continued working

1346
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.940
<v Eric Allman:>there for a while but realized that

1347
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.686
<v Eric Allman:>I'd come in once a week and

1348
01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:14.600
<v Eric Allman:>say hi to people but that was

1349
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.920
<v Eric Allman:>not all I was doing and I

1350
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Eric Allman:>don't like doing jobs which are nothing,

1351
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Eric Allman:>you know, getting paid to do nothing.

1352
01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.600
<v Eric Allman:>Didn't sit well with me.

1353
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So at that some point I left

1354
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Sendmail, which was right about the time

1355
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.700
<v Elisabetta Mori:>it was acquired by Proofpoint.

1356
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And things worked out pretty well actually.

1357
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.640
<v Elisabetta Mori:>The customers, all the products continued to

1358
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.380
<v Elisabetta Mori:>be supported.

1359
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.560
<v Elisabetta Mori:>The employees, except for upper management, kept

1360
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>their jobs.

1361
01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And, you know, it was, you know,

1362
01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.960
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I'm kind of sorry that Sendmail didn't

1363
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.379
<v Elisabetta Mori:>turn into a big star, but it

1364
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Elisabetta Mori:>wasn't adequate result.

1365
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Unfortunately, the investors, myself included, didn't do

1366
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Elisabetta Mori:>very well.

1367
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what did you do when you

1368
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>left SendMail?

1369
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, that was the second time I

1370
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.660
<v Eric Allman:>made a kind of job mistake.

1371
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Eric Allman:>I went to work at a company

1372
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Eric Allman:>in San Francisco, which perhaps I shouldn't

1373
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:41.880
<v Eric Allman:>name, but doing streaming database queries.

1374
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.439
<v Eric Allman:>So taking SQL and instead of having

1375
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.840
<v Eric Allman:>it say, here's the data, you know,

1376
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.600
<v Eric Allman:>tell me what the average salary is,

1377
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.120
<v Eric Allman:>it would watch the data as it

1378
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.660
<v Eric Allman:>came through, computing things and picking out

1379
01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.140
<v Eric Allman:>other things, which was actually an interesting

1380
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:00.560
<v Eric Allman:>idea.

1381
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Eric Allman:>It's actually a pretty good idea.

1382
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.839
<v Eric Allman:>But it was, the coding was all

1383
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Eric Allman:>in C++, a language that I despise,

1384
01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.580
<v Eric Allman:>and Java, a language which I didn't

1385
01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.420
<v Eric Allman:>really know.

1386
01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:16.439
<v Eric Allman:>And the management at that company was

1387
01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.120
<v Eric Allman:>very, very proud of the fact that

1388
01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.899
<v Eric Allman:>they had a million lines of source

1389
01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:21.399
<v Eric Allman:>code.

1390
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Eric Allman:>And they're like, ooh, we're gonna tell

1391
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.960
<v Eric Allman:>everyone how much source code we have.

1392
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.979
<v Eric Allman:>And the engineers are all going, no,

1393
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.300
<v Eric Allman:>don't do it.

1394
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.200
<v Eric Allman:>We have a million lines of source

1395
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.960
<v Eric Allman:>code because we couldn't figure out how

1396
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.060
<v Eric Allman:>to make it smaller.

1397
01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.060
<v Eric Allman:>And so that was a very demoralizing.

1398
01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Eric Allman:>I think I did one, you know,

1399
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.019
<v Eric Allman:>made one innovation where I discovered an

1400
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.420
<v Eric Allman:>N squared algorithm in the thing, but

1401
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.380
<v Eric Allman:>which was, you know, that's a big

1402
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:51.880
<v Eric Allman:>deal.

1403
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.399
<v Eric Allman:>But I felt like I wasn't succeeding

1404
01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Eric Allman:>very well.

1405
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.040
<v Eric Allman:>And I was thinking, you know, maybe

1406
01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.160
<v Eric Allman:>after all that time at Sendmail where

1407
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.399
<v Eric Allman:>I basically wasn't writing any code anymore

1408
01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.180
<v Eric Allman:>and maybe I just couldn't do it

1409
01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Eric Allman:>anymore.

1410
01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:10.519
<v Eric Allman:>So I ended up putting my tail

1411
01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.279
<v Eric Allman:>between my legs and gave that one

1412
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:13.779
<v Eric Allman:>up.

1413
01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:19.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>In 2011 you kind of retired.

1414
01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.359
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what did you do?

1415
01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:24.719
<v Eric Allman:>Well, yeah, I I did actually try

1416
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.506
<v Eric Allman:>to retire I..

1417
01:09:26.506 --> 01:09:33.620
<v Eric Allman:>you know did some but I was

1418
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.480
<v Eric Allman:>basically saying okay, you know at this

1419
01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.800
<v Eric Allman:>point I've got enough money in the

1420
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Eric Allman:>bank.

1421
01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:41.099
<v Eric Allman:>You know, Sendmail was paying me pretty

1422
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.679
<v Eric Allman:>well, but I live a pretty frugal

1423
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Eric Allman:>lifestyle.

1424
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:48.460
<v Eric Allman:>So I had actually amassed a nice

1425
01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Eric Allman:>nest egg.

1426
01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:57.180
<v Eric Allman:>And so back in my mammoth days,

1427
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.720
<v Eric Allman:>one of the things that happened was

1428
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.080
<v Eric Allman:>the computer science department moved into a

1429
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Eric Allman:>new building and so all of those

1430
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.519
<v Eric Allman:>computers and things that I was talking

1431
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.679
<v Eric Allman:>about had to move from the old

1432
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.639
<v Eric Allman:>building into the new building and the

1433
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.139
<v Eric Allman:>new building had to have a whole

1434
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.587
<v Eric Allman:>new network and so forth.

1435
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.440
<v Eric Allman:>And I worked with another staff member,

1436
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:27.340
<v Eric Allman:>a guy named Ken Lutz, who as

1437
01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.740
<v Eric Allman:>near as I can tell has worked

1438
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Eric Allman:>on every interesting project that Berkeley has

1439
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Eric Allman:>ever done in computer science.

1440
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.540
<v Eric Allman:>He's, you know, did RAID and network

1441
01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Eric Allman:>abort stations and all these really cool

1442
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.360
<v Eric Allman:>projects.

1443
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.320
<v Eric Allman:>So I ran into him, actually, no,

1444
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320
<v Eric Allman:>I didn't run into him.

1445
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.480
<v Eric Allman:>He called me, I guess, and said,

1446
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Eric Allman:>you know, Eric, I'm working at a

1447
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.600
<v Eric Allman:>new research lab called the Swarm Lab

1448
01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.240
<v Eric Allman:>at Berkeley.

1449
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.900
<v Eric Allman:>And there's some stuff going on here

1450
01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Eric Allman:>I think you might find interesting.

1451
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.599
<v Eric Allman:>And we have seminars at lunchtime on

1452
01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.980
<v Eric Allman:>Thursdays, free lunch.

1453
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.480
<v Eric Allman:>Why don't you come up and see

1454
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.000
<v Eric Allman:>what we're doing?" I went, well sure,

1455
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.800
<v Eric Allman:>okay, free lunch, got me.

1456
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.759
<v Eric Allman:>And so I went up and indeed

1457
01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.220
<v Eric Allman:>it was very interesting.

1458
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.200
<v Eric Allman:>Now this was the first time I've

1459
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.920
<v Eric Allman:>been in a lab which looked like

1460
01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Eric Allman:>a lab.

1461
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.860
<v Eric Allman:>This is where they have oscilloscopes and

1462
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Eric Allman:>signal generators and microscopes and heavy duty

1463
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Eric Allman:>chemicals and so forth.

1464
01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Eric Allman:>And I was a software guy.

1465
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.460
<v Eric Allman:>But it was still really interesting stuff.

1466
01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.719
<v Eric Allman:>And so I ended up hanging out

1467
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.860
<v Eric Allman:>at a research project and at some

1468
01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Eric Allman:>point was hanging out enough that they

1469
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.660
<v Eric Allman:>ended up hiring me.

1470
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Eric Allman:>So I went back to work, working

1471
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.240
<v Eric Allman:>for the university.

1472
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Eric Allman:>And so that I believe will be

1473
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Eric Allman:>the last job of my career unless

1474
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.640
<v Eric Allman:>something changes.

1475
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.940
<v Eric Allman:>So I bracketed my career with university

1476
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Eric Allman:>jobs, which, you know, I'm not unhappy

1477
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:06.800
<v Eric Allman:>about that.

1478
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Eric Allman:>And I do have to say like

1479
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.880
<v Eric Allman:>I said after I finished with the

1480
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Eric Allman:>previous company I was really kind of

1481
01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.240
<v Eric Allman:>demoralized, convinced that I just couldn't program

1482
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:19.780
<v Eric Allman:>anymore.

1483
01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.160
<v Eric Allman:>And I ended up writing most of

1484
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Eric Allman:>the code for that research project and

1485
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.540
<v Eric Allman:>kind of got my mojo back.

1486
01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.400
<v Eric Allman:>So it was a good job and

1487
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.100
<v Eric Allman:>I loved working with him.

1488
01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.140
<v Eric Allman:>He was absolutely fabulous guy.

1489
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.099
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So during your career, you received many

1490
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:48.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>honors and in particular, In 2014, you

1491
01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:51.460
<v Elisabetta Mori:>were inducted to the Internet Hall of

1492
01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Fame.

1493
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:53.740
<v Eric Allman:>Yes.

1494
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Did you expect that?

1495
01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.060
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Did I expect that?

1496
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Not at all.

1497
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Yeah, I don't quite remember how it

1498
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.640
<v Elisabetta Mori:>even came about but yeah, I flew

1499
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.379
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to Hong Kong for that ceremony and

1500
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you know, they they made a big

1501
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.686
<v Elisabetta Mori:>deal out of it.

1502
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:24.759
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And they end up having a whole

1503
01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.099
<v Elisabetta Mori:>bunch of really interesting people.

1504
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It turns out I already personally knew

1505
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>some of the inductees, including Paul Bixey,

1506
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.000
<v Elisabetta Mori:>who was inducted the same time I

1507
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:37.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>was.

1508
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.679
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So he and I ran around Hong

1509
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Kong together.

1510
01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>That was pretty cool.

1511
01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And yeah, you know, it was obviously

1512
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>for internet mail.

1513
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And they had some clever way of

1514
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Elisabetta Mori:>making it sound more important than it

1515
01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>actually was.

1516
01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>But there you go.

1517
01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You have been involved in Usenix since

1518
01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the 70s, 1970s.

1519
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:14.700
<v Eric Allman:>Yes.

1520
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.639
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What have been your roles in the

1521
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>years?

1522
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:27.680
<v Eric Allman:>So, so I started just attending USENIX.

1523
01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.340
<v Eric Allman:>The first USENIX I went to was

1524
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.220
<v Eric Allman:>in San Francisco.

1525
01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:37.140
<v Eric Allman:>And Tom Ferron, who I mentioned earlier,

1526
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.300
<v Eric Allman:>was chairing that conference.

1527
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.940
<v Eric Allman:>And it was an amazingly wonderful conference.

1528
01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Eric Allman:>It's like you know I'm with my

1529
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.740
<v Eric Allman:>people here This is great and so

1530
01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>I started going to more conferences and

1531
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.360
<v Eric Allman:>eventually I ended up on the board

1532
01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.460
<v Eric Allman:>of directors and did that for several

1533
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:04.080
<v Eric Allman:>years and several different roles I think

1534
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.120
<v Eric Allman:>I was Vice President at one point

1535
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.887
<v Eric Allman:>and Treasurer another point.

1536
01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.179
<v Eric Allman:>But there are term limits on the

1537
01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.520
<v Eric Allman:>using sport, which is a good thing.

1538
01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.372
<v Eric Allman:>I believe in term limits and so

1539
01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.820
<v Eric Allman:>I'm still however on the audit committee.

1540
01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.559
<v Eric Allman:>So every year we get together and

1541
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.220
<v Eric Allman:>go through the audits of the finances

1542
01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.700
<v Eric Allman:>to make sure there's no hanky-panky going

1543
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.200
<v Eric Allman:>on.

1544
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.800
<v Eric Allman:>So I'm still connected with these things.

1545
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So you publish several papers, books, articles.

1546
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.339
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What is the publication you are most

1547
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Elisabetta Mori:>proud of?

1548
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.080
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I don't know that I

1549
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.680
<v Eric Allman:>would say pride exactly.

1550
01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.501
<v Eric Allman:>You know some of them have been

1551
01:15:59.502 --> 01:15:59.509
<v Eric Allman:>important.

1552
01:15:59.509 --> 01:15:59.559
<v Eric Allman:>There's been you know papers that came

1553
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560
<v Eric Allman:>out with important.

1554
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:06.400
<v Eric Allman:>There's been papers that came out associated

1555
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.540
<v Eric Allman:>with Ingress that have made an impact.

1556
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.980
<v Eric Allman:>I was on the editorial review board

1557
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Eric Allman:>of, not unit review, that's a different

1558
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.740
<v Eric Allman:>one, of ACM Q Magazine.

1559
01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.040
<v Eric Allman:>And as a result of being on

1560
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.740
<v Eric Allman:>that board, wrote a lot of articles

1561
01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:30.600
<v Eric Allman:>for Q, which was designed more for

1562
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.560
<v Eric Allman:>practitioners.

1563
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.080
<v Eric Allman:>So it wasn't, you know, hardcore bits

1564
01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Eric Allman:>and bytes.

1565
01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:40.060
<v Eric Allman:>And one of those, managing technical debt,

1566
01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.180
<v Eric Allman:>turns out to now be probably my

1567
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.620
<v Eric Allman:>most referenced paper ever.

1568
01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.440
<v Eric Allman:>People are referencing it all over the

1569
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:50.940
<v Eric Allman:>place.

1570
01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.620
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I think it's a good

1571
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.320
<v Eric Allman:>paper, you know, article, really, not a

1572
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:55.820
<v Eric Allman:>paper.

1573
01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.940
<v Eric Allman:>But I don't quite understand why that's

1574
01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Eric Allman:>more important than some of the other

1575
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.520
<v Eric Allman:>ones I've done.

1576
01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Eric Allman:>You know, obviously, the Sendmail book was

1577
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Eric Allman:>a big deal at the time.

1578
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.400
<v Eric Allman:>It was a...

1579
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.200
<v Eric Allman:>O'Reilly and Associates said it was their

1580
01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.280
<v Eric Allman:>best-selling book for several years.

1581
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Eric Allman:>So Brian Costales was the primary author

1582
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Eric Allman:>on that, so I can't really take

1583
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Eric Allman:>the credit for that one.

1584
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.660
<v Eric Allman:>I don't know.

1585
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.860
<v Eric Allman:>I mean, I try and do, I

1586
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.800
<v Eric Allman:>try and feel at least not embarrassed

1587
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Eric Allman:>by anything I publish.

1588
01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Eric Allman:>So I don't know if that means

1589
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.000
<v Eric Allman:>proud.

1590
01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Eric Allman:>I guess it's more important what has

1591
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.660
<v Eric Allman:>actually had impact and Those two things

1592
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Eric Allman:>are probably the ones that have had

1593
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.681
<v Eric Allman:>the most impact.

1594
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what activities have you pursued recently?

1595
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.960
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, well I retired from the university

1596
01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.440
<v Eric Allman:>in and you know really retired from

1597
01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.040
<v Eric Allman:>the university this time as in, you

1598
01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.320
<v Eric Allman:>know, I'm getting a pension.

1599
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.940
<v Eric Allman:>And so, you know, I still do

1600
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Eric Allman:>technology work and so forth.

1601
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.740
<v Eric Allman:>I'm a wine collector.

1602
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Eric Allman:>And so I built a database to

1603
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.760
<v Eric Allman:>store the inventory of our wine cellar.

1604
01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.740
<v Eric Allman:>And that's all in Python, which was

1605
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.080
<v Eric Allman:>a language I had to learn in

1606
01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.440
<v Eric Allman:>order to do this.

1607
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Eric Allman:>And I'm kind of the default system

1608
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.360
<v Eric Allman:>administrator for the house, which I kind

1609
01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.280
<v Eric Allman:>of hate, but somebody has to do

1610
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:47.780
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1611
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.040
<v Eric Allman:>I got involved in a place called

1612
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.880
<v Eric Allman:>the Hillside, Berkeley Hillside Club, several years

1613
01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.840
<v Eric Allman:>ago, originally just as a member.

1614
01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.820
<v Eric Allman:>Hillside Club is a member organization focusing

1615
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:09.360
<v Eric Allman:>on basically art, architecture, you know, certain

1616
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.360
<v Eric Allman:>current event things, climate change, et cetera.

1617
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.660
<v Eric Allman:>And at some point ended up, I

1618
01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Eric Allman:>didn't get out of the way fast

1619
01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.759
<v Eric Allman:>enough and I ended up being elected

1620
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.560
<v Eric Allman:>to the board.

1621
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Eric Allman:>And I just literally a few days

1622
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.960
<v Eric Allman:>ago, turned out and I ultimately ended

1623
01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.062
<v Eric Allman:>up as President.

1624
01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:40.320
<v Eric Allman:>And I'm this President for two years

1625
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.440
<v Eric Allman:>and I'm gratified that many people have

1626
01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.900
<v Eric Allman:>told me that I was actually a

1627
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.720
<v Eric Allman:>good President.

1628
01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.840
<v Eric Allman:>So I almost feel like now that

1629
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.599
<v Eric Allman:>I've retired, I may have gotten this

1630
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.020
<v Eric Allman:>management thing working.

1631
01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.759
<v Eric Allman:>And actually after swearing I would never

1632
01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.639
<v Eric Allman:>start another company again in my life.

1633
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.720
<v Eric Allman:>I started another company called the, it's

1634
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:09.020
<v Eric Allman:>a not-for-profit called the Berkeley Historic Building

1635
01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:09.520
<v Eric Allman:>Fund.

1636
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.340
<v Eric Allman:>And it's to collect money to maintain

1637
01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Eric Allman:>historic buildings, including the building that the

1638
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Eric Allman:>Hillside Club is in.

1639
01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:24.960
<v Eric Allman:>So we are interested in getting a

1640
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.920
<v Eric Allman:>new roof and things like that.

1641
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.320
<v Eric Allman:>So I'm kind of doing, you know,

1642
01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Eric Allman:>more social things now, not so much

1643
01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.660
<v Eric Allman:>serious tech.

1644
01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay, let's go back to many years

1645
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>ago.

1646
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So In 1976, you came out of

1647
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:47.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the closet.

1648
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.420
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You already mentioned your partner.

1649
01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>But what I wanted to ask you

1650
01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.020
<v Elisabetta Mori:>is, what happened in 1976?

1651
01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.219
<v Elisabetta Mori:>How you did it and what was

1652
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.640
<v Elisabetta Mori:>its impact in those days, in the

1653
01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>mid-70s?

1654
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.160
<v Eric Allman:>I was in an emotionally very, very

1655
01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:10.960
<v Eric Allman:>bad way.

1656
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Eric Allman:>I won't go into the gory details,

1657
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.480
<v Eric Allman:>but it became very clear to me

1658
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.500
<v Eric Allman:>that I had to come out and

1659
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.960
<v Eric Allman:>I didn't even want to consider the

1660
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.460
<v Eric Allman:>alternative.

1661
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:32.840
<v Eric Allman:>And that was probably the best decision

1662
01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Eric Allman:>I've ever made in my life.

1663
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.120
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I lost some friends.

1664
01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.740
<v Eric Allman:>You know, when I came out of

1665
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.240
<v Eric Allman:>the closet, I didn't just like open

1666
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.780
<v Eric Allman:>the door, I used dynamite to blow

1667
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.460
<v Eric Allman:>it open.

1668
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.960
<v Eric Allman:>And I was working on the Ingress

1669
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>Project back then.

1670
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Eric Allman:>And there were some people who were

1671
01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Eric Allman:>clearly concerned about that.

1672
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.900
<v Eric Allman:>But a whole bunch of the other

1673
01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.420
<v Eric Allman:>people were like, yay for you.

1674
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.679
<v Eric Allman:>And some of those people remained some

1675
01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.740
<v Eric Allman:>of my best friends.

1676
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.920
<v Eric Allman:>But more importantly, I think I mentioned

1677
01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Eric Allman:>kind of an angry personality for a

1678
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:20.780
<v Eric Allman:>while.

1679
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.519
<v Eric Allman:>You know, some of that was, you

1680
01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Eric Allman:>know, frankly, I got some of it

1681
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:30.320
<v Eric Allman:>from my father, but a lot of

1682
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Eric Allman:>it was just pent up, you know,

1683
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Eric Allman:>self-hatred, I guess.

1684
01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:41.060
<v Eric Allman:>And that let me open up.

1685
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.380
<v Eric Allman:>And, You know, like I said, there

1686
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.660
<v Eric Allman:>were people who, you know, I lost,

1687
01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:55.460
<v Eric Allman:>but it gave me a path to

1688
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.740
<v Eric Allman:>being an easier to get along with

1689
01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.240
<v Eric Allman:>person.

1690
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.220
<v Eric Allman:>And so I think it, you know,

1691
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Eric Allman:>completely changed my personality.

1692
01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Eric Allman:>I'm much less of an asshole than

1693
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.300
<v Eric Allman:>I was before.

1694
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.740
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, I did at some

1695
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.960
<v Eric Allman:>point meet a guy who was actually

1696
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.400
<v Eric Allman:>a student at Berkeley.

1697
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.040
<v Eric Allman:>I was still on the Ingress project,

1698
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.080
<v Eric Allman:>but I was out at that point

1699
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Eric Allman:>and at the time he was in

1700
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.559
<v Eric Allman:>the closet and so it didn't go

1701
01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.120
<v Eric Allman:>well and for a couple of years

1702
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.320
<v Eric Allman:>if we saw each other in the

1703
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.940
<v Eric Allman:>hallway, we'd both turn around and walk

1704
01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:39.780
<v Eric Allman:>the other direction.

1705
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.019
<v Eric Allman:>But then went to a gay students

1706
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.960
<v Eric Allman:>union meeting once, which I almost never

1707
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.060
<v Eric Allman:>did, but I did that day and

1708
01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.639
<v Eric Allman:>who would be in the room but

1709
01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.860
<v Eric Allman:>the same guy, tried to hide behind

1710
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Eric Allman:>a pillow.

1711
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.880
<v Eric Allman:>And we've been together ever since, 44

1712
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Eric Allman:>years.

1713
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.740
<v Eric Allman:>So in 1998, you said in an

1714
01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.560
<v Eric Allman:>interview, there is some sort of perverse

1715
01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.480
<v Eric Allman:>pleasure in knowing that it's basically impossible

1716
01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.080
<v Eric Allman:>to send a piece of hate mail

1717
01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.085
<v Eric Allman:>out through the internet without...(voice gets cut)

1718
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.394
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, that was a period where there

1719
01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:34.460
<v Eric Allman:>was a lot of sort of Christian

1720
01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:37.080
<v Eric Allman:>fundamentalism that somehow was sneaking into the

1721
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.340
<v Eric Allman:>technology world.

1722
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.880
<v Eric Allman:>Somebody was proposing a new version of

1723
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.360
<v Eric Allman:>Unix called Yazix, I think.

1724
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.740
<v Eric Allman:>And you know, there would be no

1725
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.560
<v Eric Allman:>kill command because you know to kill

1726
01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.480
<v Eric Allman:>as a sin so they renamed that

1727
01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.320
<v Eric Allman:>and they obviously they had to get

1728
01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Eric Allman:>rid of some mail because it was

1729
01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.480
<v Eric Allman:>written by what do they say a

1730
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.580
<v Eric Allman:>well-known gay activist or something like that.

1731
01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.780
<v Eric Allman:>I don't remember exactly what it was.

1732
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.500
<v Eric Allman:>And I can't even remember when or

1733
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.440
<v Eric Allman:>where I said that or to whom,

1734
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.280
<v Eric Allman:>But it was just kind of an

1735
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.340
<v Eric Allman:>offhanded, you know, aside.

1736
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.780
<v Eric Allman:>And Sendmail survived and Yazix or whatever

1737
01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.220
<v Eric Allman:>they were calling it didn't.

1738
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.560
<v Eric Allman:>So I win.

1739
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.519
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Would you like to say anything else

1740
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.875
<v Elisabetta Mori:>about your husband?

1741
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.299
<v Eric Allman:>Sure, Kirk McKusick, another kind of luminary.

1742
01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Eric Allman:>I know you've interviewed him.

1743
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.740
<v Eric Allman:>He shared an office with Bill Joy,

1744
01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.394
<v Eric Allman:>so I knew Bill pretty well.

1745
01:25:56.394 --> 01:26:05.740
<v Eric Allman:>He's one of those people he Actually

1746
01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.360
<v Eric Allman:>what he it's PhD was in table

1747
01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.580
<v Eric Allman:>driven register allocation for compilers, something like

1748
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.080
<v Eric Allman:>that.

1749
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.440
<v Eric Allman:>Something that he has used, I think,

1750
01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.780
<v Eric Allman:>once in his career.

1751
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:23.200
<v Eric Allman:>Although it turns out that his PhD

1752
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.320
<v Eric Allman:>thesis is now referenced by a bunch

1753
01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.540
<v Eric Allman:>of people because as computers get to

1754
01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.740
<v Eric Allman:>the point where they have more and

1755
01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:32.559
<v Eric Allman:>more registers, the algorithms that he came

1756
01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.440
<v Eric Allman:>up with are completely the right things,

1757
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.900
<v Eric Allman:>but that's not what he's working on

1758
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Eric Allman:>He started working on the file system

1759
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.440
<v Eric Allman:>for Unix.

1760
01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.980
<v Eric Allman:>Once again, Bill Joy saying "hey Kirk,

1761
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.580
<v Eric Allman:>you know, why don't you work on

1762
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:49.019
<v Eric Allman:>this?" and Bill was really good at

1763
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.660
<v Eric Allman:>getting other people to do things.

1764
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.260
<v Eric Allman:>And he wrote what was called at

1765
01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Eric Allman:>the time the FAST file system.

1766
01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.960
<v Eric Allman:>It's now been renamed UFS, the Unix

1767
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.960
<v Eric Allman:>file system, because it's essentially the default

1768
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.340
<v Eric Allman:>Unix file system for everyone.

1769
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.860
<v Eric Allman:>But he's kept on it.

1770
01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:19.140
<v Eric Allman:>And he has added all kinds of

1771
01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:23.940
<v Eric Allman:>stuff, Background FSCK, for example, so you

1772
01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.500
<v Eric Allman:>didn't have to wait forever for the

1773
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.540
<v Eric Allman:>system to reboot.

1774
01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.440
<v Eric Allman:>And snapshots, so you could get a

1775
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.320
<v Eric Allman:>backup of a clean file system that

1776
01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.540
<v Eric Allman:>wasn't changing out from under you and

1777
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Eric Allman:>and and and and and.

1778
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.380
<v Eric Allman:>He's done recently a bunch of work

1779
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.480
<v Eric Allman:>for Netflix, kind of counterintuitive.

1780
01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:53.780
<v Eric Allman:>Netflix uses this file system to distribute

1781
01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.820
<v Eric Allman:>the actual movies that are on the

1782
01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.320
<v Eric Allman:>internet.

1783
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Eric Allman:>And the discs that they use, every

1784
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.900
<v Eric Allman:>day they rewrite them in the middle

1785
01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.240
<v Eric Allman:>of the night predicting what is going

1786
01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.220
<v Eric Allman:>to be valuable the next day and

1787
01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Eric Allman:>so if a disc dies we have

1788
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.340
<v Eric Allman:>as many discs as Netflix does there's

1789
01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.800
<v Eric Allman:>always a dead disc They didn't want

1790
01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.120
<v Eric Allman:>the whole system to crash.

1791
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.020
<v Eric Allman:>They just wanted the system to say,

1792
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:23.720
<v Eric Allman:>oh, that disk went away, okay, I'll

1793
01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.120
<v Eric Allman:>just skip over that.

1794
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.940
<v Eric Allman:>And so they actually paid him to

1795
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.019
<v Eric Allman:>do that work on the condition that

1796
01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.580
<v Eric Allman:>it go into the open source.

1797
01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.100
<v Eric Allman:>So the whole world benefits from that.

1798
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.799
<v Eric Allman:>So yeah, he's still working on file

1799
01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.300
<v Eric Allman:>systems.

1800
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Have you ever worked together or collaborated

1801
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>on a project?

1802
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, many of them.

1803
01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.599
<v Eric Allman:>Well, I kind of worked on Trek

1804
01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Eric Allman:>with Steve, Steve Warren.

1805
01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.340
<v Eric Allman:>The ADIT project had multiple programmers on

1806
01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:13.520
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1807
01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.400
<v Eric Allman:>There was one guy in particular, uh,

1808
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.600
<v Eric Allman:>who, uh, kind of, we did kind

1809
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.560
<v Eric Allman:>of co-coding for big chunks of it.

1810
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.719
<v Eric Allman:>So we'd actually go into the office

1811
01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.740
<v Eric Allman:>at night when we wouldn't get interrupted

1812
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.020
<v Eric Allman:>and spend all night, you know, two

1813
01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.800
<v Eric Allman:>computers in the office and working on

1814
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Eric Allman:>the code, handing stuff back and forth.

1815
01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.380
<v Eric Allman:>Yeah, there's been lots of people who

1816
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:47.580
<v Eric Allman:>I've done some kind of work with.

1817
01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:53.560
<v Eric Allman:>That experience with the, with, um, at

1818
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.080
<v Eric Allman:>Britain Lee was probably the tightest I've

1819
01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Eric Allman:>ever worked with anyone before.

1820
01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:05.600
<v Eric Allman:>Others have been, you know, the surgical

1821
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.760
<v Eric Allman:>team model where there's, you know, one

1822
01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.940
<v Eric Allman:>guy in charge and other people who

1823
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.340
<v Eric Allman:>are scattered around the side.

1824
01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:17.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Husband?

1825
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.680
<v Eric Allman:>With Kirk?

1826
01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.380
<v Eric Allman:>One thing about a successful relationship is

1827
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.040
<v Eric Allman:>it may be important to not work

1828
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.200
<v Eric Allman:>too intimately on projects.

1829
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.020
<v Eric Allman:>There's a lot of stuff we've done

1830
01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.580
<v Eric Allman:>together, you know, carpentry around the house

1831
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:35.820
<v Eric Allman:>and so forth.

1832
01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.700
<v Eric Allman:>But it's like cooking together.

1833
01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.160
<v Eric Allman:>We learned a long time ago that

1834
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Eric Allman:>we can cook together as long as

1835
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.360
<v Eric Allman:>we know who's making dinner and who's

1836
01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.220
<v Eric Allman:>helping.

1837
01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.500
<v Eric Allman:>And it trades off which is which.

1838
01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.880
<v Eric Allman:>Doesn't really matter, it's not like one

1839
01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.160
<v Eric Allman:>of us has to be in control

1840
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.320
<v Eric Allman:>all the time, but if we try

1841
01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.700
<v Eric Allman:>and negotiate everything, it can be a

1842
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.200
<v Eric Allman:>problem.

1843
01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Bigly I agree with you.

1844
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:11.000
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, what is your main motivation in

1845
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>supporting free and open source software?

1846
01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.460
<v Eric Allman:>You know, if I'm going to be

1847
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.040
<v Eric Allman:>gallant, I'll make some comment about making

1848
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Eric Allman:>the world a better place, etc., etc.

1849
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.219
<v Eric Allman:>If I'm going to be a little

1850
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.860
<v Eric Allman:>more honest, I think it's just because

1851
01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.019
<v Eric Allman:>I really love it when people use

1852
01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.360
<v Eric Allman:>the stuff I've written.

1853
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.960
<v Eric Allman:>And the easiest way to do that

1854
01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.100
<v Eric Allman:>is to give it away.

1855
01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.460
<v Eric Allman:>So I have, my whole career, I

1856
01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.760
<v Eric Allman:>have not gone for the jobs that

1857
01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.980
<v Eric Allman:>make the most money.

1858
01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Eric Allman:>I've gone to the jobs that most

1859
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.200
<v Eric Allman:>interest me, you know, and assumed that

1860
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.040
<v Eric Allman:>the money would sort of follow along.

1861
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.680
<v Eric Allman:>And, you know, I could be way,

1862
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.940
<v Eric Allman:>way richer than I am right now.

1863
01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:04.460
<v Eric Allman:>But why?

1864
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.360
<v Eric Allman:>I've got enough money that I can

1865
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.900
<v Eric Allman:>retire comfortably, and I can't buy islands

1866
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.340
<v Eric Allman:>or fly private jets or anything like

1867
01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:14.840
<v Eric Allman:>that.

1868
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:16.840
<v Eric Allman:>But I'm happy.

1869
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:23.360
<v Eric Allman:>And so, yeah, just having people use

1870
01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.020
<v Eric Allman:>the work.

1871
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.519
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I love it when somebody

1872
01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Eric Allman:>comes up and says, oh, I use,

1873
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.740
<v Eric Allman:>you know, whatever, Sendmail, whatever, and you

1874
01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:32.940
<v Eric Allman:>know, I loved it.

1875
01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.380
<v Eric Allman:>That just makes me all warm inside.

1876
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So if you look at your life,

1877
01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>what is the thing you're the most

1878
01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>proud of?

1879
01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.100
<v Eric Allman:>Most proud of in my life, it's,

1880
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.880
<v Eric Allman:>I'm tempted to say coming out of

1881
01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:00.059
<v Eric Allman:>the closet because it made my life

1882
01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.280
<v Eric Allman:>a lot better and frankly the lives

1883
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Eric Allman:>of other people around me a lot

1884
01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.460
<v Eric Allman:>better.

1885
01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.820
<v Eric Allman:>SendMail obviously had an incredible impact.

1886
01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.740
<v Eric Allman:>SendMail is still out there on the

1887
01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:17.219
<v Eric Allman:>internet but it's nowhere near the market

1888
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.560
<v Eric Allman:>share that it used to have.

1889
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.380
<v Eric Allman:>That's okay.

1890
01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:23.040
<v Eric Allman:>Syslog turned out to be really, really

1891
01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:23.540
<v Eric Allman:>important.

1892
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.519
<v Eric Allman:>And once again, it's been rewritten.

1893
01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.260
<v Eric Allman:>It's not my code anymore, but it

1894
01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.160
<v Eric Allman:>was my idea.

1895
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.800
<v Eric Allman:>You know, the environment at the computer

1896
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.180
<v Eric Allman:>science department at Berkeley, where I had

1897
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.580
<v Eric Allman:>something to do with building it, I'm

1898
01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.760
<v Eric Allman:>really proud of.

1899
01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:48.840
<v Eric Allman:>It really improved the ability for researchers

1900
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.520
<v Eric Allman:>to get their jobs done across the

1901
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.380
<v Eric Allman:>entire department.

1902
01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.099
<v Eric Allman:>It wasn't just my group, it was

1903
01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.780
<v Eric Allman:>the whole department.

1904
01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.540
<v Eric Allman:>And that's really pretty cool.

1905
01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Eric Allman:>You know, the honors and stuff don't

1906
01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.940
<v Eric Allman:>mean that much to me.

1907
01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Eric Allman:>You know, I mean, it's nice to

1908
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:11.240
<v Eric Allman:>be recognized, but it's not like I,

1909
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.580
<v Eric Allman:>you know, have plaques all around my

1910
01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.019
<v Eric Allman:>office, you know, showing off the awards

1911
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:17.580
<v Eric Allman:>that I've gotten.

1912
01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:18.840
<v Eric Allman:>I think that's tacky.

1913
01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What advice would you give to someone

1914
01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>willing to pursue a career today?

1915
01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Eric Allman:>Well, it depends on what your goals

1916
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.560
<v Eric Allman:>in life are, I guess.

1917
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.860
<v Eric Allman:>Like it's said, I've done the bit

1918
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:49.920
<v Eric Allman:>of going on and doing whole bunches

1919
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Eric Allman:>of different things, which means I've learned

1920
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Eric Allman:>a lot, means I'm probably never the

1921
01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.040
<v Eric Allman:>best at anything at any given time

1922
01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.640
<v Eric Allman:>because I'm the one who's learning about

1923
01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1924
01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:07.260
<v Eric Allman:>But there's a famous guy, won the

1925
01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.519
<v Eric Allman:>Turing Award, Jim Gray, who sadly was

1926
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.540
<v Eric Allman:>lost at sea several years ago.

1927
01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.560
<v Eric Allman:>And Jim was a friend of mine.

1928
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.500
<v Eric Allman:>And his thing was doing massive databases.

1929
01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.500
<v Eric Allman:>And he would pick something that had

1930
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.040
<v Eric Allman:>never been done before and then do

1931
01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:27.540
<v Eric Allman:>it.

1932
01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:32.780
<v Eric Allman:>And these things were earth changing, in

1933
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.320
<v Eric Allman:>some senses quite literally.

1934
01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.380
<v Eric Allman:>Maps, the database technology that we have

1935
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.900
<v Eric Allman:>to store maps that you use from

1936
01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Eric Allman:>everyone today was developed by Jim.

1937
01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.740
<v Eric Allman:>And the thing about Jim was he,

1938
01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.299
<v Eric Allman:>when he went into a new thing,

1939
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.160
<v Eric Allman:>he didn't just say, okay, what's the,

1940
01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.980
<v Eric Allman:>what do I as a computer scientist

1941
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Eric Allman:>need to know?

1942
01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.540
<v Eric Allman:>He said he wants to understand the

1943
01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:04.940
<v Eric Allman:>technology or the science that is applied.

1944
01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.299
<v Eric Allman:>So his last project was working on

1945
01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:11.040
<v Eric Allman:>the sky map, said, you know, well,

1946
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.740
<v Eric Allman:>what's bigger than the whole planet?

1947
01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.360
<v Eric Allman:>Oh, how about the whole universe?

1948
01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:21.220
<v Eric Allman:>And when he was honored after he

1949
01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Eric Allman:>passed away, somebody on that project said,

1950
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.040
<v Eric Allman:>Jim came in and he said, I

1951
01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.500
<v Eric Allman:>want to learn about astronomy, not what's

1952
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.419
<v Eric Allman:>your data problem.

1953
01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.420
<v Eric Allman:>He said, I want to understand astronomy.

1954
01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.200
<v Eric Allman:>And he started actually making serious contributions

1955
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:36.600
<v Eric Allman:>to the project.

1956
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Eric Allman:>I think that's great.

1957
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.019
<v Eric Allman:>And if you can do it, that's

1958
01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.520
<v Eric Allman:>wonderful.

1959
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:48.160
<v Eric Allman:>But I remember chatting with him at

1960
01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.400
<v Eric Allman:>some point, and he was working at

1961
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.040
<v Eric Allman:>Microsoft, and he said, they're paying me

1962
01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Eric Allman:>an obscene amount of money for work

1963
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.900
<v Eric Allman:>that I would happily do for free

1964
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Eric Allman:>if they just gave me the resources

1965
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.620
<v Eric Allman:>to do it with.

1966
01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.840
<v Eric Allman:>This was a perfect life and so

1967
01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Eric Allman:>if you can get the perfect life,

1968
01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Eric Allman:>go for it.

1969
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.400
<v Eric Allman:>You know other people like Kirk are

1970
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.820
<v Eric Allman:>very happy to you know kind of

1971
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Eric Allman:>carve out this area and you know

1972
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.800
<v Eric Allman:>if you carve out an area don't

1973
01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.639
<v Eric Allman:>make it too small don't make it

1974
01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.160
<v Eric Allman:>too big.

1975
01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.646
<v Eric Allman:>So, yeah, I would definitely say you

1976
01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.080
<v Eric Allman:>know followed the interest don't follow the

1977
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Eric Allman:>money obviously, we need enough to be

1978
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.120
<v Eric Allman:>able to put food in the refrigerator

1979
01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.140
<v Eric Allman:>and so forth.

1980
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.559
<v Eric Allman:>But I think a lot of people

1981
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.679
<v Eric Allman:>going into deep learning AI today are

1982
01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:56.080
<v Eric Allman:>doing it because they think there's, data

1983
01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.679
<v Eric Allman:>scientists are going to make a huge

1984
01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Eric Allman:>amount of money.

1985
01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.160
<v Eric Allman:>And that's true, some of them will,

1986
01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.400
<v Eric Allman:>but there's so many people going into

1987
01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.639
<v Eric Allman:>it right now that there will be

1988
01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Eric Allman:>a glut of data scientists in a

1989
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.040
<v Eric Allman:>few years.

1990
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.059
<v Eric Allman:>And I did neural networks when neural

1991
01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.520
<v Eric Allman:>networks were out of favor.

1992
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.920
<v Eric Allman:>And I kind of like doing stuff

1993
01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.160
<v Eric Allman:>that is not popular and having it

1994
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.560
<v Eric Allman:>become popular later.

1995
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.900
<v Eric Allman:>The database interfaces, graphical database interfaces that

1996
01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.600
<v Eric Allman:>I mentioned earlier, you know, three years

1997
01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.361
<v Eric Allman:>later that's what everyone wanted.

1998
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.440
<v Eric Allman:>And that VP of marketing was an

1999
01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Eric Allman:>idiot.

2000
01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:47.080
<v Eric Allman:>So, do something exciting, do something that's

2001
01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Eric Allman:>challenging, and enjoy it.

2002
01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.220
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Is there anything you would like to

2003
01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:00.059
<v Elisabetta Mori:>add that you haven't covered today?

2004
01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:02.610
<v Eric Allman:>Probably tons of things.

2005
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Eric Allman:>But I was thinking of something earlier,

2006
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.100
<v Eric Allman:>but I've lost it.

2007
01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.300
<v Eric Allman:>So I'm just going to say no.

2008
01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay.

2009
01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>We can cover this in another interview,

2010
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:23.500
<v Elisabetta Mori:>perhaps?

2011
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.060
<v Eric Allman:>Maybe.

2012
01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.260
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay, so thank you.

2013
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:33.380
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It's been a real pleasure talking to

2014
01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:34.060
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you today.

2015
01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.639
<v Eric Allman:>Yes, it's been a pleasure talking with

2016
01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.120
<v Eric Allman:>you too.

2017
01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Eric Allman:>It's kind of fun to reminisce.

2018
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you very much.
