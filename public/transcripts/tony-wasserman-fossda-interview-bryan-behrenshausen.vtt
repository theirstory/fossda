00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.851
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Bryan Behrenshausen interviewing Tony Wasserman for the

2
00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:06.214
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>FOSSDA project.

3
00:00:06.274 --> 00:00:07.845
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Tony, thanks so much for doing this.

4
00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:08.629
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Really appreciate it.

5
00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:10.803
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Absolutely.

6
00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I want to start just to talk

7
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.715
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>about your early academic pursuits, I guess,

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.624
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>because I'm trying to paint a picture

9
00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:22.791
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of what gets a person attracted to

10
00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:24.882
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>open source and how different people find

11
00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.227
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>their ways into computer science and open

12
00:00:27.248 --> 00:00:27.529
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>source.

13
00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.941
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And so I want to talk about

14
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.866
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>about where you went to college and

15
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:32.869
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>what you went to college for.

16
00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.654
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I think you were a double major,

17
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.202
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>is that right?

18
00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:36.369
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It's true.

19
00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:37.403
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

20
00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:38.386
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Tell me a little bit about where

21
00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you went to school and what you

22
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>went to school for.

23
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.964
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I went to Cal, University of

24
00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:42.986
<v Tony Wasserman:>California, Berkeley.

25
00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:46.641
<v Tony Wasserman:>I went there from Coral Gables, Florida

26
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.443
<v Tony Wasserman:>of all places.

27
00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I have my parents to thank

28
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.992
<v Tony Wasserman:>for letting me go all the way

29
00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Tony Wasserman:>across the country.

30
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was really because I think

31
00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:00.553
<v Tony Wasserman:>my father always wanted to move to

32
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Tony Wasserman:>California and didn't.

33
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.785
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so it seemed like the place

34
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:05.105
<v Tony Wasserman:>to go.

35
00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:08.311
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I did a double major in

36
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Tony Wasserman:>math and physics at Berkeley, and I

37
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.808
<v Tony Wasserman:>took my first computing course as a

38
00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:19.991
<v Tony Wasserman:>junior at Cal.

39
00:01:20.712 --> 00:01:23.595
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was very quickly obvious to

40
00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:25.464
<v Tony Wasserman:>me that I was much better at

41
00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.851
<v Tony Wasserman:>programming and computing than I was at

42
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:28.714
<v Tony Wasserman:>math or physics.

43
00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:37.071
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so having gone through Berkeley, I

44
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.295
<v Tony Wasserman:>then went to graduate school at University

45
00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:42.501
<v Tony Wasserman:>of Wisconsin, Madison.

46
00:01:43.363 --> 00:01:45.569
<v Tony Wasserman:>And my original thought was that I

47
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.334
<v Tony Wasserman:>would go for a master's degree, but

48
00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:50.085
<v Tony Wasserman:>they gave me money and made me

49
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.589
<v Tony Wasserman:>an RA and encouraged me to stay.

50
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.483
<v Tony Wasserman:>So eventually I got a doctorate in,

51
00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:58.849
<v Tony Wasserman:>of all things, artificial intelligence.

52
00:01:59.471 --> 00:01:59.852
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

53
00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I want to talk about that a

54
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.861
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>little bit then too.

55
00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:02.362
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

56
00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:07.972
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that was very early in the

57
00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:11.039
<v Tony Wasserman:>AI days during the initial wave of

58
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Tony Wasserman:>excitement, which then went to sleep for

59
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.646
<v Tony Wasserman:>50 years.

60
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:21.756
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that was my academic education and

61
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.881
<v Tony Wasserman:>coming out.

62
00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:26.889
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think the two things that stuck

63
00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.954
<v Tony Wasserman:>with me from my graduate school was

64
00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:36.612
<v Tony Wasserman:>one, writing interactive programs because the technology

65
00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:38.255
<v Tony Wasserman:>at the time was really primitive.

66
00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Tony Wasserman:>Rolls of teletype paper that printed 10

67
00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.855
<v Tony Wasserman:>uppercase characters per second and clattered as

68
00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:48.296
<v Tony Wasserman:>it did it.

69
00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:51.066
<v Tony Wasserman:>So when you put this in front

70
00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:53.611
<v Tony Wasserman:>of somebody who was unfamiliar with computers,

71
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.295
<v Tony Wasserman:>as I had to do for my

72
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.747
<v Tony Wasserman:>research, it was really quite an interesting

73
00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:01.774
<v Tony Wasserman:>exercise and taught me a lot at

74
00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:04.404
<v Tony Wasserman:>this very, very early stage of computing

75
00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:08.995
<v Tony Wasserman:>about user experiences and human computer interaction.

76
00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:10.924
<v Tony Wasserman:>And And I did a little bit

77
00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.191
<v Tony Wasserman:>more work on that over the years.

78
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.194
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that was one thing that I

79
00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:14.861
<v Tony Wasserman:>came away with.

80
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.024
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the other thing that I came

81
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:18.351
<v Tony Wasserman:>away with was how to architect large

82
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.185
<v Tony Wasserman:>software systems, because my dissertation program got

83
00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>to be quite large and being able

84
00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.459
<v Tony Wasserman:>to read all this code after you've

85
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>you've written it for years.

86
00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:30.667
<v Tony Wasserman:>And even if it's your own code,

87
00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:34.734
<v Tony Wasserman:>being able to do all these things

88
00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:36.624
<v Tony Wasserman:>that we now take for granted in

89
00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:40.734
<v Tony Wasserman:>software engineering levels of abstraction and modularization.

90
00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:42.924
<v Tony Wasserman:>I went back and I looked at

91
00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:47.011
<v Tony Wasserman:>this 50-plus-year-old code not too long ago,

92
00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.476
<v Tony Wasserman:>and it was written in ALGOL.

93
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>I've only ever heard of that language.

94
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.333
<v Tony Wasserman:>I don't think I've ever even seen

95
00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:54.393
<v Tony Wasserman:>it.

96
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:56.244
<v Tony Wasserman:>ALGOL is wonderful.

97
00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Tony Wasserman:>I mean, it was perfect for these

98
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.815
<v Tony Wasserman:>stack architectures machines.

99
00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:04.869
<v Tony Wasserman:>And ALGOL predates Fortran, actually.

100
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.595
<v Tony Wasserman:>Not by much, but it does.

101
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:08.501
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

102
00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:10.465
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was much more of an

103
00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:11.507
<v Tony Wasserman:>international effort.

104
00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Tony Wasserman:>So it was great.

105
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:16.541
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I did this on a Burroughs

106
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:17.042
<v Tony Wasserman:>computer.

107
00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.847
<v Tony Wasserman:>You've probably never heard of Burroughs computers

108
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:19.148
<v Tony Wasserman:>either.

109
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.702
<v Tony Wasserman:>But at the time, it was IBM

110
00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:26.209
<v Tony Wasserman:>and the seven dwarfs, RCA and General

111
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.275
<v Tony Wasserman:>Electric and Honeywell and Burroughs and UNIVAC

112
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.585
<v Tony Wasserman:>and Control Data.

113
00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:32.407
<v Tony Wasserman:>That's six.

114
00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:33.208
<v Tony Wasserman:>That's not bad.

115
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:34.331
<v Tony Wasserman:>There's a seventh.

116
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.654
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oh, scientific data systems.

117
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.941
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that's seven.

118
00:04:38.304 --> 00:04:39.467
<v Tony Wasserman:>Those are the seven dwarfs.

119
00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:41.751
<v Tony Wasserman:>And IBM had like 70% market share.

120
00:04:48.463 --> 00:04:52.389
<v Tony Wasserman:>But that was where I did my

121
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.732
<v Tony Wasserman:>work, and I learned about how to

122
00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:56.676
<v Tony Wasserman:>design large systems.

123
00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:57.602
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

124
00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:58.744
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So I want to...

125
00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.549
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>That's fascinating.

126
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.413
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I want to back up a little

127
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>bit, just talk about that crossroads that

128
00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:06.304
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you found yourself at.

129
00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:08.409
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You sort of glossed over something I

130
00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.561
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>think is all too common for folks

131
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:12.182
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>in academe.

132
00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:13.845
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And that is, you had a set

133
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:16.911
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of interests that led you into certain

134
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.943
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>fields, in this case, math and physics.

135
00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:23.512
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And then there was something, and you

136
00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:24.801
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>said, because you were better at it.

137
00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:26.907
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>But I would venture to say that

138
00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.151
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>there's probably a lot of things you're

139
00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:30.242
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>good at or better at than math

140
00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:31.927
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>and physics that you didn't go into.

141
00:05:32.628 --> 00:05:34.392
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So I guess my question is twofold.

142
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.225
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>One, what do you think it was

143
00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.293
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>about you as a person that initially

144
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.025
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>got started, math and physics?

145
00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:44.669
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What about your personality led you to

146
00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:45.311
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>those fields?

147
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:48.423
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And then can you remember the moment

148
00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:51.529
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>where you realized like, oh, this is

149
00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:53.893
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>where I'm meant to go?

150
00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:55.456
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Do you have any memories?

151
00:05:57.063 --> 00:05:57.664
<v Tony Wasserman:>A little bit.

152
00:05:57.744 --> 00:05:59.628
<v Tony Wasserman:>I mean, from the time that I

153
00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:03.014
<v Tony Wasserman:>was very young, I was good at

154
00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:05.665
<v Tony Wasserman:>arithmetic and mathematics and memory numbers, all

155
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:06.727
<v Tony Wasserman:>things numerical.

156
00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:09.674
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so it seemed like the natural

157
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Tony Wasserman:>direction.

158
00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:13.951
<v Tony Wasserman:>And when you're in elementary school or

159
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.041
<v Tony Wasserman:>middle school or high school, there are

160
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Tony Wasserman:>certain things that you don't have to

161
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.172
<v Tony Wasserman:>worry at all.

162
00:06:21.212 --> 00:06:22.194
<v Tony Wasserman:>You just got it made.

163
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:27.224
<v Tony Wasserman:>If you're at that level.

164
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so it always seemed to me

165
00:06:31.572 --> 00:06:34.596
<v Tony Wasserman:>that my ability in mathematics was so

166
00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:37.405
<v Tony Wasserman:>natural, and that was reinforced by SAT

167
00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:42.415
<v Tony Wasserman:>scores and high school grades and all

168
00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.236
<v Tony Wasserman:>those kinds of things.

169
00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:46.186
<v Tony Wasserman:>So when it came time to pick

170
00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:49.252
<v Tony Wasserman:>a major, it wasn't as much as

171
00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:51.376
<v Tony Wasserman:>I'm interested in history, for example.

172
00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:51.402
<v Tony Wasserman:>I see.

173
00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:51.421
<v Tony Wasserman:>I see.

174
00:06:53.262 --> 00:07:00.532
<v Tony Wasserman:>And actually took some history courses at

175
00:07:00.912 --> 00:07:00.972
<v Tony Wasserman:>Cal.

176
00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:02.835
<v Tony Wasserman:>It wasn't what I was going to

177
00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:03.676
<v Tony Wasserman:>do with my life.

178
00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:06.284
<v Tony Wasserman:>I always had the impression that you

179
00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:08.669
<v Tony Wasserman:>could make a living at mathematics.

180
00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:12.219
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I guess that's true still.

181
00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:14.204
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, I assume so.

182
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:16.707
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I also assume that when you

183
00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:18.151
<v Tony Wasserman:>were in school, in primary school,

184
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.506
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you didn't have access to computers, right?

185
00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You wouldn't have known that you had

186
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.308
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>an affinity for computational mathematics or computer

187
00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:32.584
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>science or computer hardware in general, because

188
00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>your first exposure to them was probably

189
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.313
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>at the university level.

190
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:36.321
<v Tony Wasserman:>Right.

191
00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:38.085
<v Tony Wasserman:>That's correct.

192
00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:41.631
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because when I was seven years old,

193
00:07:42.873 --> 00:07:45.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>there was a national election, and they

194
00:07:45.522 --> 00:07:48.167
<v Tony Wasserman:>had the UNIVAC brain.

195
00:07:48.188 --> 00:07:49.672
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yes, I remember.

196
00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:50.854
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, I've seen the footage.

197
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:54.287
<v Tony Wasserman:>Predicting the outcome of the election.

198
00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.213
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that was kind of my first

199
00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:58.901
<v Tony Wasserman:>introduction to computing, and and they made

200
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:01.426
<v Tony Wasserman:>it seem so mystical.

201
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.053
<v Tony Wasserman:>It was kind of there in the

202
00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:05.835
<v Tony Wasserman:>back of my mind.

203
00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:11.788
<v Tony Wasserman:>But computing really was not an issue

204
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.855
<v Tony Wasserman:>for people, certainly not until the late

205
00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:20.846
<v Tony Wasserman:>1950s, when banks and airlines and the

206
00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:24.412
<v Tony Wasserman:>like began using them for a lot

207
00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:26.155
<v Tony Wasserman:>of their routine things.

208
00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:29.585
<v Tony Wasserman:>Of course, computers were used in the

209
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:33.533
<v Tony Wasserman:>defense and military areas, but that was

210
00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Tony Wasserman:>not an area that I knew anything

211
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.445
<v Tony Wasserman:>about, nor did I have any interest

212
00:08:40.948 --> 00:08:41.128
<v Tony Wasserman:>in.

213
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.674
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I've done a PhD as well,

214
00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:46.396
<v Tony Wasserman:>and in my field in

215
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.549
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>communication studies, the dissertation involves essentially like

216
00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:52.645
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>the production of a large monograph, essentially

217
00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.969
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>like a book-length monograph.

218
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:55.300
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>But from what I understand, you you

219
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>were saying earlier, your dissertation project involved,

220
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.401
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I'm sure, a significant amount of writing,

221
00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:03.629
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>but also building a program.

222
00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:04.089
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Is that right?

223
00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:05.253
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>That's right.

224
00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:06.255
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I mean, you know,

225
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.007
<v Tony Wasserman:>my dissertation runs 200 some odd pages.

226
00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:11.072
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think I have a digital copy

227
00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Tony Wasserman:>of it on this machine somewhere.

228
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:21.694
<v Tony Wasserman:>But because it was systems-oriented, you had

229
00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:24.502
<v Tony Wasserman:>to build something and demonstrate it.

230
00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:28.208
<v Tony Wasserman:>So the code was somewhere above 10,000

231
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.511
<v Tony Wasserman:>lines.

232
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:31.375
<v Tony Wasserman:>I don't remember the exact count, but

233
00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:33.122
<v Tony Wasserman:>it was a fair amount of code.

234
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:36.832
<v Tony Wasserman:>And what specific dissertation or what specific

235
00:09:36.893 --> 00:09:37.454
<v Tony Wasserman:>problem was

236
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.347
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>your dissertation trying to figure out?

237
00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:41.810
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What were you tackling?

238
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:43.335
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>The title of the dissertation

239
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.928
<v Tony Wasserman:>was Achievement of Skill and Generality in

240
00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:49.165
<v Tony Wasserman:>an Artificial Intelligence Program, which is a

241
00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:50.812
<v Tony Wasserman:>problem that exists to this day.

242
00:09:54.763 --> 00:09:57.468
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What do they call Alexa add-ons, right?

243
00:09:57.489 --> 00:09:58.371
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>They call them skills.

244
00:09:58.672 --> 00:10:00.661
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You download skills for your Alexa, right?

245
00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:04.268
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>We don't have any listening devices in

246
00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:04.911
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>my house.

247
00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:06.875
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I don't either.

248
00:10:07.844 --> 00:10:08.507
<v Tony Wasserman:>Except for this.

249
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:18.129
<v Tony Wasserman:>One of the things that strikes me

250
00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:21.483
<v Tony Wasserman:>as particularly interesting about the OpenAI and

251
00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:24.709
<v Tony Wasserman:>the GPT-4 and BARD technologies is that

252
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:28.656
<v Tony Wasserman:>they do cover, they have one skill

253
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>that they're really, really good at, which

254
00:10:30.466 --> 00:10:36.488
<v Tony Wasserman:>is information retrieval and compression and restatement.

255
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>But it works across a wide variety

256
00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:40.656
<v Tony Wasserman:>of domains.

257
00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:44.766
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because the other day, for example, I

258
00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:48.773
<v Tony Wasserman:>asked BARD to help me plan a

259
00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:51.119
<v Tony Wasserman:>couple of days of sightseeing on an

260
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.962
<v Tony Wasserman:>upcoming trip.

261
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.667
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it gave me a very nice

262
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:55.270
<v Tony Wasserman:>list of suggestions.

263
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:57.541
<v Tony Wasserman:>At one o'clock in the afternoon, do

264
00:10:57.581 --> 00:10:57.862
<v Tony Wasserman:>this.

265
00:10:57.882 --> 00:11:00.207
<v Tony Wasserman:>At three o'clock in the afternoon, do

266
00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:00.548
<v Tony Wasserman:>that.

267
00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:03.359
<v Tony Wasserman:>Go have tapas at this place at

268
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.981
<v Tony Wasserman:>this time.

269
00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:06.646
<v Tony Wasserman:>It was pretty impressive.

270
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.435
<v Tony Wasserman:>What was your dissertation specifically?

271
00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:14.168
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What did your program do with regard

272
00:11:14.188 --> 00:11:14.669
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>to AI?

273
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:17.354
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It was the world's best bridge bidding

274
00:11:17.414 --> 00:11:17.755
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>program.

275
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.184
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

276
00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:25.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because at the time, there was, of

277
00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:27.936
<v Tony Wasserman:>course, checkers, which was very early and

278
00:11:27.936 --> 00:11:33.950
<v Tony Wasserman:>not not such a huge problem to

279
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:35.213
<v Tony Wasserman:>build a skillful program.

280
00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.776
<v Tony Wasserman:>But people were starting to work on

281
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.424
<v Tony Wasserman:>chess, of course, at that time.

282
00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:42.154
<v Tony Wasserman:>And chess is a combinatorially difficult problem.

283
00:11:43.683 --> 00:11:45.006
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it turns out that bridge the

284
00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:47.452
<v Tony Wasserman:>same way, the number of hands that

285
00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:49.461
<v Tony Wasserman:>can be dealt and the division of

286
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:54.027
<v Tony Wasserman:>them among multiple players, turns out that

287
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.090
<v Tony Wasserman:>it's hard.

288
00:11:56.672 --> 00:12:00.802
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the technology that I used, there

289
00:12:00.822 --> 00:12:03.367
<v Tony Wasserman:>were two or three technologies, but what

290
00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:04.590
<v Tony Wasserman:>I used was rule-based.

291
00:12:05.853 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that you had to, there there

292
00:12:08.743 --> 00:12:11.247
<v Tony Wasserman:>are ways, standard ways to evaluate the

293
00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:15.035
<v Tony Wasserman:>cards in your hand and to interpret

294
00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:18.345
<v Tony Wasserman:>the bids that your partner makes to

295
00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:22.952
<v Tony Wasserman:>help you come up with a final

296
00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.656
<v Tony Wasserman:>bid or maybe seat to the opposition,

297
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.487
<v Tony Wasserman:>the contract that's to be made.

298
00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:32.794
<v Tony Wasserman:>Now, later on, after I had left

299
00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:37.547
<v Tony Wasserman:>the university, I did, in fact, work

300
00:12:37.587 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Tony Wasserman:>with one other person and we built

301
00:12:39.271 --> 00:12:41.535
<v Tony Wasserman:>the play of the hand part and

302
00:12:41.575 --> 00:12:43.162
<v Tony Wasserman:>it played quite well.

303
00:12:44.043 --> 00:12:47.409
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the fascinating thing about it is

304
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:51.255
<v Tony Wasserman:>that we found somebody who wanted to

305
00:12:51.315 --> 00:12:54.924
<v Tony Wasserman:>manufacture a box, right?

306
00:12:55.104 --> 00:13:00.091
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there's an item called the Goran

307
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:00.992
<v Tony Wasserman:>Bridge Master.

308
00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.361
<v Tony Wasserman:>And you can find them, they're very

309
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:07.428
<v Tony Wasserman:>scarce, but on bidding sites, you can

310
00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:07.949
<v Tony Wasserman:>find them.

311
00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:10.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I have one that's kind of

312
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.241
<v Tony Wasserman:>unopened, untouched.

313
00:13:11.842 --> 00:13:13.966
<v Tony Wasserman:>But the asking price was $350, which

314
00:13:13.986 --> 00:13:15.048
<v Tony Wasserman:>is, you know, it limited the appeal.

315
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:22.723
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Oh, that was 1970s dollars, $350, 1970s

316
00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:23.887
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>dollars, not the cost of the one

317
00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:28.021
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>from the internet that you bought.

318
00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:29.123
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Right.

319
00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:30.646
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Ah, gotcha.

320
00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:32.992
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, that limits your audience a little

321
00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:33.154
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>bit.

322
00:13:33.214 --> 00:13:33.334
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yep.

323
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.424
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, a little bit prohibitive.

324
00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:38.992
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so, and of course, they didn't

325
00:13:39.012 --> 00:13:40.481
<v Tony Wasserman:>spend as much money as they might

326
00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:41.402
<v Tony Wasserman:>have on marketing.

327
00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:42.205
<v Tony Wasserman:>So who knows?

328
00:13:42.507 --> 00:13:44.031
<v Tony Wasserman:>There was no social media to get

329
00:13:44.092 --> 00:13:44.613
<v Tony Wasserman:>the word out.

330
00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:50.349
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we might have had a different

331
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:53.574
<v Tony Wasserman:>outcome in a modern era with a

332
00:13:53.614 --> 00:13:56.843
<v Tony Wasserman:>different price point and a different marketing

333
00:13:56.884 --> 00:13:58.727
<v Tony Wasserman:>message, but that's something we'll never know.

334
00:13:59.048 --> 00:13:59.829
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, right.

335
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:02.795
<v Tony Wasserman:>So when then did

336
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.125
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you first encounter the idea of open

337
00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:07.266
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>source software?

338
00:14:08.068 --> 00:14:12.314
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So I think it came about in

339
00:14:12.355 --> 00:14:12.816
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>two ways.

340
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.344
<v Tony Wasserman:>The first was that I was aware

341
00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:22.272
<v Tony Wasserman:>of the things like IBM Share and

342
00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:26.781
<v Tony Wasserman:>Guide, which were, you know, these annual

343
00:14:26.841 --> 00:14:31.049
<v Tony Wasserman:>meetings where the company would talk about

344
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:35.381
<v Tony Wasserman:>its future plans, and people brought software

345
00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:35.801
<v Tony Wasserman:>to share.

346
00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:39.590
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the mentality at the time was

347
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.452
<v Tony Wasserman:>very, very different.

348
00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:43.342
<v Tony Wasserman:>That is, it's the hardware that's expensive,

349
00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:45.828
<v Tony Wasserman:>and the software isn't worth anything.

350
00:14:46.229 --> 00:14:50.101
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, here's my routine to perform

351
00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:50.983
<v Tony Wasserman:>this calculation.

352
00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:54.190
<v Tony Wasserman:>Here's this one to compute some trajectory,

353
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.221
<v Tony Wasserman:>you know, share and share alike.

354
00:14:58.683 --> 00:15:03.612
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that was something I knew

355
00:15:03.692 --> 00:15:03.992
<v Tony Wasserman:>about.

356
00:15:04.012 --> 00:15:05.996
<v Tony Wasserman:>I didn't have any particular use for

357
00:15:06.036 --> 00:15:07.781
<v Tony Wasserman:>it at the time.

358
00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:15.692
<v Tony Wasserman:>But then when UNIX came in the

359
00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:18.696
<v Tony Wasserman:>1970s, I was on the faculty at

360
00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:21.182
<v Tony Wasserman:>UC San Francisco, and then I was

361
00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:24.448
<v Tony Wasserman:>also a lecturer at Berkeley, where I

362
00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:28.876
<v Tony Wasserman:>taught data structures and operating systems and

363
00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:30.903
<v Tony Wasserman:>things like that.

364
00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Berkeley at the time got one

365
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.593
<v Tony Wasserman:>of the earliest PDP 1170, well, I

366
00:15:37.614 --> 00:15:41.882
<v Tony Wasserman:>think it was a 45 originally, that

367
00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:45.048
<v Tony Wasserman:>ran at least part of the day

368
00:15:45.108 --> 00:15:45.809
<v Tony Wasserman:>it ran UNIX.

369
00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:51.021
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then very quickly, they had machines

370
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.584
<v Tony Wasserman:>that ran UNIX all the time.

371
00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:57.273
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Berkeley received a grant from the

372
00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.022
<v Tony Wasserman:>United States Department of of Defense that

373
00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:05.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>involved enhancing AT&T UNIX.

374
00:16:06.352 --> 00:16:08.814
<v Tony Wasserman:>So Berkeley got the source code to

375
00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:09.396
<v Tony Wasserman:>AT&T UNIX.

376
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.149
<v Tony Wasserman:>And they made a bunch of changes,

377
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:16.354
<v Tony Wasserman:>virtual memory being the one that is

378
00:16:16.614 --> 00:16:17.901
<v Tony Wasserman:>perhaps the most significant.

379
00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:19.906
<v Tony Wasserman:>They made this all run on a

380
00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:27.347
<v Tony Wasserman:>digital equipment corporation, VAX 11780, and distributed

381
00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:27.447
<v Tony Wasserman:>it.

382
00:16:28.328 --> 00:16:32.135
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the license from AT&T was a

383
00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:33.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>commercial license.

384
00:16:34.603 --> 00:16:38.551
<v Tony Wasserman:>But in the, in the academic setting,

385
00:16:38.972 --> 00:16:41.982
<v Tony Wasserman:>with government money being spent, then then

386
00:16:42.423 --> 00:16:43.425
<v Tony Wasserman:>the license was different.

387
00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:49.056
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so they created the BSD license.

388
00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.127
<v Tony Wasserman:>Nobody used the term open source software

389
00:16:52.187 --> 00:16:53.189
<v Tony Wasserman:>at that point.

390
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.695
<v Tony Wasserman:>It was the BSD license.

391
00:16:57.302 --> 00:17:03.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so anybody could obtain the software,

392
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.834
<v Tony Wasserman:>or you could go spend $43,000 with

393
00:17:05.854 --> 00:17:08.820
<v Tony Wasserman:>AT&T to get the commercial one.

394
00:17:10.144 --> 00:17:12.448
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, there's a history here

395
00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:16.120
<v Tony Wasserman:>of different hardware vendors, either supporting the

396
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:19.368
<v Tony Wasserman:>AT&T version of the UNIX or the

397
00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:22.655
<v Tony Wasserman:>modified Berkeley version of UNIX.

398
00:17:22.734 --> 00:17:26.509
<v Tony Wasserman:>But, but the, the Berkeley version certainly

399
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.574
<v Tony Wasserman:>won out in academia because the price

400
00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:28.995
<v Tony Wasserman:>was right.

401
00:17:29.881 --> 00:17:31.825
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we got to a point

402
00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:37.096
<v Tony Wasserman:>where almost every computer science department had

403
00:17:37.096 --> 00:17:40.227
<v Tony Wasserman:>a a VAX and ran UNIX and

404
00:17:40.347 --> 00:17:42.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>students learned a lot of their computing

405
00:17:43.414 --> 00:17:43.875
<v Tony Wasserman:>on UNIX.

406
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>Things like the VI editor were developed

407
00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.174
<v Tony Wasserman:>by Bill Joy at, at Berkeley.

408
00:17:51.254 --> 00:17:54.726
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, he had a different

409
00:17:54.806 --> 00:17:57.472
<v Tony Wasserman:>version of UNIX of, I'm sorry, VI

410
00:17:58.073 --> 00:17:58.654
<v Tony Wasserman:>every day.

411
00:17:58.674 --> 00:18:02.626
<v Tony Wasserman:>So you could, yes, it was really

412
00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:07.875
<v Tony Wasserman:>a model for the kind of rinse,

413
00:18:07.915 --> 00:18:08.815
<v Tony Wasserman:>lather and repeat.

414
00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.866
<v Tony Wasserman:>So it was a, it was a

415
00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:18.654
<v Tony Wasserman:>very agile approach to building the software

416
00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:21.702
<v Tony Wasserman:>before anybody used the term agile to

417
00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:23.564
<v Tony Wasserman:>describe the process.

418
00:18:24.447 --> 00:18:29.375
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so that's, you know, that's the

419
00:18:29.435 --> 00:18:30.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>origin of VI.

420
00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:36.968
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that, what that led to,

421
00:18:36.988 --> 00:18:40.273
<v Tony Wasserman:>I was working on a project in,

422
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:44.142
<v Tony Wasserman:>at UC San Francisco, project was called

423
00:18:44.242 --> 00:18:45.564
<v Tony Wasserman:>user software engineering.

424
00:18:46.367 --> 00:18:49.254
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the term was coined because software

425
00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:50.742
<v Tony Wasserman:>engineering was the big thing, right?

426
00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:54.891
<v Tony Wasserman:>Top down design and this kind of

427
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:55.332
<v Tony Wasserman:>thing.

428
00:18:55.693 --> 00:18:56.659
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I said, well, you know, if

429
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.168
<v Tony Wasserman:>you're building interactive systems, people don't really

430
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.741
<v Tony Wasserman:>care about how your system is architected.

431
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:06.347
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so we were doing what I

432
00:19:06.427 --> 00:19:09.172
<v Tony Wasserman:>call the outside in engineering.

433
00:19:09.853 --> 00:19:13.863
<v Tony Wasserman:>So getting, getting user interface right.

434
00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Tony Wasserman:>And if you think about this the

435
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.934
<v Tony Wasserman:>user interface in that era, as I

436
00:19:19.975 --> 00:19:22.103
<v Tony Wasserman:>said before, was extremely primitive.

437
00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:25.430
<v Tony Wasserman:>We had moved on from TTY terminals

438
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:31.806
<v Tony Wasserman:>to 24 by 80 visual displays that

439
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.710
<v Tony Wasserman:>looked like a TV set with a

440
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.271
<v Tony Wasserman:>keyboard.

441
00:19:35.673 --> 00:19:39.423
<v Tony Wasserman:>They were monochrome, you know, black on

442
00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:41.025
<v Tony Wasserman:>white was really sophisticated.

443
00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:42.830
<v Tony Wasserman:>Green on black was more common.

444
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:49.087
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there were, there were thousands of

445
00:19:49.148 --> 00:19:51.454
<v Tony Wasserman:>different manufacturers of these terminals.

446
00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:53.925
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so one of the things that

447
00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:55.949
<v Tony Wasserman:>they had to do in Unix was

448
00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:01.824
<v Tony Wasserman:>to create a library that was dependent

449
00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:04.551
<v Tony Wasserman:>on the characteristics of each terminal.

450
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:07.400
<v Tony Wasserman:>This was a library called Curses, which

451
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:10.507
<v Tony Wasserman:>is a funny, funny name for it.

452
00:20:11.188 --> 00:20:13.433
<v Tony Wasserman:>Anyway, to come back to the UCSF

453
00:20:13.453 --> 00:20:15.983
<v Tony Wasserman:>situation, we were doing UCSF, we're doing

454
00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:17.105
<v Tony Wasserman:>user software engineering.

455
00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:21.033
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we were building tools to

456
00:20:21.093 --> 00:20:23.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>support this method, because to me, you

457
00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:26.268
<v Tony Wasserman:>can have a method for building software,

458
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.715
<v Tony Wasserman:>but tools exist to support a method.

459
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:32.848
<v Tony Wasserman:>So since most of the applications we

460
00:20:32.888 --> 00:20:34.753
<v Tony Wasserman:>were concerned with at the time were

461
00:20:34.813 --> 00:20:39.148
<v Tony Wasserman:>conversational access to databases, we built a

462
00:20:39.188 --> 00:20:40.130
<v Tony Wasserman:>database system.

463
00:20:40.892 --> 00:20:42.134
<v Tony Wasserman:>And this was at a very early

464
00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:46.346
<v Tony Wasserman:>stage, building a relational database system.

465
00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:50.734
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, the research papers were written

466
00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:51.280
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 1970.

467
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.310
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the first relational database systems showed

468
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.192
<v Tony Wasserman:>up at the end of the 1970s.

469
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.751
<v Tony Wasserman:>System R, IBM Research, and Ingress at

470
00:21:03.771 --> 00:21:05.474
<v Tony Wasserman:>Berkeley, and a couple of others.

471
00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:10.146
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we built a tool for user

472
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.287
<v Tony Wasserman:>interface prototyping.

473
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.976
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we built a database management system,

474
00:21:17.781 --> 00:21:20.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>and we made them available.

475
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:22.613
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we made them available under a

476
00:21:22.673 --> 00:21:23.615
<v Tony Wasserman:>BSD license.

477
00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:29.471
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we licensed the people who licensed

478
00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:32.076
<v Tony Wasserman:>the software from the University of California,

479
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.825
<v Tony Wasserman:>San Francisco, or from the regents of

480
00:21:33.845 --> 00:21:36.332
<v Tony Wasserman:>the University of California, they could have

481
00:21:36.373 --> 00:21:37.681
<v Tony Wasserman:>it and use it.

482
00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:41.168
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we got a reasonably good reaction

483
00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:45.902
<v Tony Wasserman:>to it, which led us forward, because

484
00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:47.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>people came and said, well, who's going

485
00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:48.452
<v Tony Wasserman:>to support all of this stuff?

486
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:51.927
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yes, the universities were fine, they would

487
00:21:51.947 --> 00:21:52.388
<v Tony Wasserman:>play with it.

488
00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:56.881
<v Tony Wasserman:>But once somebody in companies wanted it,

489
00:21:57.002 --> 00:22:03.273
<v Tony Wasserman:>then, you know, the IT manager said,

490
00:22:03.413 --> 00:22:04.836
<v Tony Wasserman:>well, you know, who's going to support,

491
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.524
<v Tony Wasserman:>we can't use this unless there's support

492
00:22:06.585 --> 00:22:06.866
<v Tony Wasserman:>for it.

493
00:22:07.749 --> 00:22:09.314
<v Tony Wasserman:>And back to us and say, well,

494
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.181
<v Tony Wasserman:>who's going to support it?

495
00:22:11.103 --> 00:22:12.606
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we said, okay, we'll do it.

496
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.235
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that led to our starting

497
00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:17.760
<v Tony Wasserman:>a company.

498
00:22:19.623 --> 00:22:23.228
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the products that we had, the

499
00:22:23.249 --> 00:22:26.193
<v Tony Wasserman:>things that we built at UCSF were

500
00:22:27.035 --> 00:22:29.644
<v Tony Wasserman:>foundations for the computer aided software engineering

501
00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:30.627
<v Tony Wasserman:>tools that we built.

502
00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:32.994
<v Tony Wasserman:>They ran on some workstations and all

503
00:22:33.014 --> 00:22:35.405
<v Tony Wasserman:>of the other engineering workstations of that

504
00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:35.866
<v Tony Wasserman:>era.

505
00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:39.254
<v Tony Wasserman:>And most of the software we built

506
00:22:39.334 --> 00:22:41.343
<v Tony Wasserman:>in the company was proprietary.

507
00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:44.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>But those pieces that we had licensed

508
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.944
<v Tony Wasserman:>from the University of California, we put

509
00:22:48.984 --> 00:22:51.689
<v Tony Wasserman:>a clause in our license agreement that

510
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:54.995
<v Tony Wasserman:>talked about this particular part of the

511
00:22:55.035 --> 00:22:57.382
<v Tony Wasserman:>software that was part of what we

512
00:22:57.423 --> 00:22:58.144
<v Tony Wasserman:>were distributing.

513
00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:02.372
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we were distributing open source software

514
00:23:02.372 --> 00:23:02.918
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 1980.

515
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.747
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, before that even existed.

516
00:23:05.828 --> 00:23:06.511
<v Tony Wasserman:>Right, right.

517
00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:07.026
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Exactly.

518
00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:07.161
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Exactly.

519
00:23:07.863 --> 00:23:11.231
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And, and, you know, Berkeley Unix was

520
00:23:11.271 --> 00:23:12.875
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>being distributed the same way.

521
00:23:14.743 --> 00:23:18.149
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there was this community around it.

522
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Ingress at Berkeley was also distributed

523
00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:25.406
<v Tony Wasserman:>under a BSD license.

524
00:23:26.148 --> 00:23:29.534
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Mike Stonebraker, who was the lead

525
00:23:29.594 --> 00:23:32.706
<v Tony Wasserman:>on that project, also started a company

526
00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:35.474
<v Tony Wasserman:>called Relational Technology initially.

527
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.025
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was just down the road

528
00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:39.348
<v Tony Wasserman:>from campus in Berkeley.

529
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:44.342
<v Tony Wasserman:>But they were quite successful with Relational

530
00:23:44.363 --> 00:23:49.072
<v Tony Wasserman:>Technology, which became Ingress, which eventually got

531
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:51.583
<v Tony Wasserman:>acquired by somebody, I don't know.

532
00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:52.767
<v Tony Wasserman:>And what was the name of your

533
00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:53.351
<v Tony Wasserman:>company again?

534
00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:56.648
<v Tony Wasserman:>Interactive Development Environments, IDE.

535
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.834
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the product was called Software Through

536
00:23:58.874 --> 00:23:59.275
<v Tony Wasserman:>Pictures.

537
00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:00.749
<v Tony Wasserman:>Ah, okay.

538
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:02.965
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we were one of the first

539
00:24:03.306 --> 00:24:07.095
<v Tony Wasserman:>products to include open source software.

540
00:24:09.265 --> 00:24:10.408
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think we were second.

541
00:24:10.889 --> 00:24:12.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think Sun Microsystems was first.

542
00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:13.503
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

543
00:24:14.201 --> 00:24:17.488
<v Tony Wasserman:>Sun basically took Berkeley Unix, they hired

544
00:24:17.528 --> 00:24:20.895
<v Tony Wasserman:>Bill Joy and other people from Berkeley.

545
00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:26.286
<v Tony Wasserman:>And they created Sun OS, which was

546
00:24:26.327 --> 00:24:27.629
<v Tony Wasserman:>a closed operating system.

547
00:24:29.292 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, you know, just as our product

548
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.244
<v Tony Wasserman:>was closed at that point, so was

549
00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:35.564
<v Tony Wasserman:>theirs.

550
00:24:36.786 --> 00:24:38.749
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so they were 1982.

551
00:24:38.749 --> 00:24:40.900
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we didn't start IDE until 1983.

552
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.407
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we didn't release anything to paying

553
00:24:48.568 --> 00:24:49.088
<v Tony Wasserman:>users until 1984.

554
00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:55.601
<v Tony Wasserman:>At the very end of 1984, it

555
00:24:56.163 --> 00:24:57.886
<v Tony Wasserman:>actually turned out we did our launch

556
00:24:57.966 --> 00:25:00.332
<v Tony Wasserman:>at a Sun user group meeting on

557
00:25:00.392 --> 00:25:01.599
<v Tony Wasserman:>election day in 1984.

558
00:25:02.921 --> 00:25:03.743
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, yeah.

559
00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:04.845
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Wow.

560
00:25:05.285 --> 00:25:09.312
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So I'm trying to determine how I

561
00:25:09.332 --> 00:25:10.774
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>want to ask this follow up question.

562
00:25:10.815 --> 00:25:12.201
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So I guess it's twofold.

563
00:25:12.502 --> 00:25:14.466
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>One, did you ever, did you always

564
00:25:14.526 --> 00:25:18.293
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>intend to work in the private sector

565
00:25:18.335 --> 00:25:19.983
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>like that, let alone start a company?

566
00:25:20.465 --> 00:25:22.791
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And second, did you ever think that

567
00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:25.465
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you would start a company selling software?

568
00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:26.928
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You know, by your own admission, when

569
00:25:26.949 --> 00:25:28.800
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you got started in the field, the

570
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.485
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>software was the trivial part.

571
00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:32.170
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It was the hardware that was expensive.

572
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.322
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Now, here you are, what a decade

573
00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:37.029
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>later, you're building a business on the

574
00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:38.412
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>buying and selling of software.

575
00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:42.627
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So did you intend to do you

576
00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:42.827
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>ever?

577
00:25:43.168 --> 00:25:44.872
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Did you foresee that path for yourself?

578
00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.254
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Was that desirable?

579
00:25:46.315 --> 00:25:46.981
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Or did did it just kind of

580
00:25:47.022 --> 00:25:47.684
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>play out that way?

581
00:25:48.165 --> 00:25:50.472
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, I think that it's accurate to

582
00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:51.194
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>say that it played

583
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.761
<v Tony Wasserman:>out that way.

584
00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:54.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I wanted to come back to

585
00:25:54.208 --> 00:25:56.053
<v Tony Wasserman:>something you said a moment ago, software

586
00:25:56.093 --> 00:25:58.144
<v Tony Wasserman:>is not software was not trivial.

587
00:25:58.585 --> 00:25:59.908
<v Tony Wasserman:>I mean, all the software that was

588
00:25:59.968 --> 00:26:00.990
<v Tony Wasserman:>being built in the 1960s broke.

589
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Tony Wasserman:>That's why.

590
00:26:03.641 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Tony Wasserman:>That's why NATO sponsored the conferences that

591
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.195
<v Tony Wasserman:>led to software engineering as a discipline,

592
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.321
<v Tony Wasserman:>right?

593
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:16.509
<v Tony Wasserman:>There was a NATO conference in Garmisch,

594
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:17.650
<v Tony Wasserman:>Germany at the end of 1968, and

595
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:22.504
<v Tony Wasserman:>a follow up in Rome at late

596
00:26:22.504 --> 00:26:23.050
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 1969.

597
00:26:23.566 --> 00:26:25.150
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there are these two volumes that

598
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.851
<v Tony Wasserman:>came out of it.

599
00:26:26.693 --> 00:26:29.102
<v Tony Wasserman:>And many of the famous early people

600
00:26:29.143 --> 00:26:32.191
<v Tony Wasserman:>in the software engineering community participated in

601
00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:35.383
<v Tony Wasserman:>this, which in effect, defined software engineering,

602
00:26:35.805 --> 00:26:39.033
<v Tony Wasserman:>and recognized that building software was anything

603
00:26:39.173 --> 00:26:39.855
<v Tony Wasserman:>but trivial.

604
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:42.146
<v Tony Wasserman:>Maybe I should Yeah, that's I miss

605
00:26:42.347 --> 00:26:43.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>I misspeak when I say that maybe

606
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.091
<v Tony Wasserman:>I should say sort of

607
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.204
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>economically trivial, right?

608
00:26:46.224 --> 00:26:48.590
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Or by your going by what you

609
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.655
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>were talking about how to earlier like

610
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.984
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>that it was everybody thought the money

611
00:26:52.024 --> 00:26:52.806
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>was in the hardware.

612
00:26:53.348 --> 00:26:55.053
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>The software was just the stuff that

613
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.646
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you passed around freely to it was

614
00:26:58.288 --> 00:26:59.953
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>not as valuable hardware was right.

615
00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:00.134
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So.

616
00:27:01.943 --> 00:27:03.526
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So it wasn't business on it.

617
00:27:04.288 --> 00:27:06.433
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, but it wasn't until software was

618
00:27:06.533 --> 00:27:07.876
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>perceived to have value,

619
00:27:08.621 --> 00:27:10.424
<v Tony Wasserman:>that it made sense to have a

620
00:27:10.484 --> 00:27:10.905
<v Tony Wasserman:>business.

621
00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:16.214
<v Tony Wasserman:>So the, the earliest commercial software was

622
00:27:16.374 --> 00:27:21.364
<v Tony Wasserman:>a sorting program in the mid 1960s.

623
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that was that came about because

624
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.732
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 1964, IBM announced the IBM, the

625
00:27:25.732 --> 00:27:26.438
<v Tony Wasserman:>system 360.

626
00:27:31.584 --> 00:27:33.908
<v Tony Wasserman:>So in in the before that they

627
00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:38.395
<v Tony Wasserman:>had commercial machines that were decimal oriented,

628
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.389
<v Tony Wasserman:>and scientific machines that were binary oriented

629
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.594
<v Tony Wasserman:>to completely different lines of machines.

630
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:47.788
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so system 360 says, Well, you

631
00:27:47.828 --> 00:27:49.152
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, we're going to do it all.

632
00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:50.600
<v Tony Wasserman:>And oh, by the way, we're going

633
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:53.186
<v Tony Wasserman:>to build a family of machines from

634
00:27:53.647 --> 00:27:56.774
<v Tony Wasserman:>small to large, that they had less

635
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.684
<v Tony Wasserman:>power than than your mobile phone, but

636
00:28:02.108 --> 00:28:05.514
<v Tony Wasserman:>but but they did go small to

637
00:28:05.554 --> 00:28:05.835
<v Tony Wasserman:>large.

638
00:28:05.855 --> 00:28:07.301
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so somebody said, Well, you know,

639
00:28:07.882 --> 00:28:10.027
<v Tony Wasserman:>all these commercial businesses need a sorting

640
00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:10.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>program.

641
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:13.240
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it's going to run on all

642
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>these IBM 360.

643
00:28:16.507 --> 00:28:17.809
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that was the start of

644
00:28:17.849 --> 00:28:19.533
<v Tony Wasserman:>the commercial software business in the mid

645
00:28:19.553 --> 00:28:19.573
<v Tony Wasserman:>1960s.

646
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.947
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and then there were some data

647
00:28:23.988 --> 00:28:26.294
<v Tony Wasserman:>management programs that that came about not

648
00:28:26.314 --> 00:28:27.241
<v Tony Wasserman:>too long thereafter.

649
00:28:28.383 --> 00:28:32.111
<v Tony Wasserman:>Things like total, which nobody's ever heard

650
00:28:32.151 --> 00:28:34.095
<v Tony Wasserman:>of at this at this time, but

651
00:28:34.135 --> 00:28:35.321
<v Tony Wasserman:>it was a big thing in its

652
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:35.722
<v Tony Wasserman:>time.

653
00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:40.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so so the software industry began

654
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.013
<v Tony Wasserman:>to develop in the 1970s.

655
00:28:42.073 --> 00:28:48.485
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that, you know, that opened up

656
00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:49.307
<v Tony Wasserman:>a possibility.

657
00:28:49.588 --> 00:28:54.595
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I think that my switching from

658
00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:59.769
<v Tony Wasserman:>academia to to industry was was driven

659
00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:00.651
<v Tony Wasserman:>by several things.

660
00:29:01.193 --> 00:29:02.775
<v Tony Wasserman:>One is sort of being in the

661
00:29:02.816 --> 00:29:04.283
<v Tony Wasserman:>right place at the right time.

662
00:29:04.283 --> 00:29:04.333
<v Tony Wasserman:>place at the right time.

663
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:07.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>I mean, the the the energy, the

664
00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:13.858
<v Tony Wasserman:>buzz around Unix, certainly was influential.

665
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:18.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then my early exposure to Sun

666
00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:23.596
<v Tony Wasserman:>Microsystems, because the among the first machines

667
00:29:23.656 --> 00:29:25.222
<v Tony Wasserman:>that were available were available were given

668
00:29:25.262 --> 00:29:25.843
<v Tony Wasserman:>to Berkeley.

669
00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:30.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so my students and I had

670
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.436
<v Tony Wasserman:>an opportunity very early on to build

671
00:29:34.496 --> 00:29:38.025
<v Tony Wasserman:>this graphical software that took advantage of

672
00:29:38.126 --> 00:29:43.034
<v Tony Wasserman:>the large bitmap bitmap display, which was

673
00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:44.762
<v Tony Wasserman:>kind of cool at the time, right?

674
00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:49.532
<v Tony Wasserman:>The computer aided design programs had preceded

675
00:29:50.534 --> 00:29:52.061
<v Tony Wasserman:>computer aided software engineering engineering by a

676
00:29:52.101 --> 00:29:52.683
<v Tony Wasserman:>couple of years.

677
00:29:53.264 --> 00:29:56.371
<v Tony Wasserman:>But, you know, you sort of you

678
00:29:56.592 --> 00:29:57.834
<v Tony Wasserman:>put one and one together and say,

679
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.085
<v Tony Wasserman:>hey, we have this unique technology, we

680
00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:01.789
<v Tony Wasserman:>have people who want us to support

681
00:30:01.829 --> 00:30:01.889
<v Tony Wasserman:>it.

682
00:30:03.133 --> 00:30:05.223
<v Tony Wasserman:>We have these ideas about tools for

683
00:30:05.263 --> 00:30:06.406
<v Tony Wasserman:>doing software design.

684
00:30:06.426 --> 00:30:08.713
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, there are a lot

685
00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:10.985
<v Tony Wasserman:>of other people starting companies these days,

686
00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:12.689
<v Tony Wasserman:>and we're at least as smart as

687
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.191
<v Tony Wasserman:>they are.

688
00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:14.074
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we thought.

689
00:30:16.503 --> 00:30:17.184
<v Tony Wasserman:>So off we went.

690
00:30:18.727 --> 00:30:21.711
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the company, we got financial funding,

691
00:30:21.731 --> 00:30:24.555
<v Tony Wasserman:>we were actually IDE was one of

692
00:30:24.596 --> 00:30:26.343
<v Tony Wasserman:>the first hundred dot coms.

693
00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:28.889
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, you know, you think today of

694
00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:31.001
<v Tony Wasserman:>the millions and millions and millions, we

695
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:31.815
<v Tony Wasserman:>were number 78.

696
00:30:34.768 --> 00:30:35.652
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>How do you know that number?

697
00:30:36.462 --> 00:30:38.469
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because there's a website called first hundred

698
00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:39.152
<v Tony Wasserman:>dot coms.

699
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:40.904
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And how do they do that?

700
00:30:40.924 --> 00:30:42.709
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Like they rank them or they note

701
00:30:42.749 --> 00:30:44.494
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>them based on when you like incorporated

702
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.588
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>like your incorporation date or the or

703
00:30:47.668 --> 00:30:49.713
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>registered you registered the domain name or

704
00:30:49.753 --> 00:30:49.994
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>what's the.

705
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.486
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yes, it was the domain registration that

706
00:30:52.506 --> 00:30:52.966
<v Tony Wasserman:>triggered it.

707
00:30:53.007 --> 00:30:56.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>So so a company like Symbolics, which

708
00:30:56.563 --> 00:31:00.392
<v Tony Wasserman:>is a LISP machine, an AI oriented

709
00:31:00.432 --> 00:31:00.732
<v Tony Wasserman:>machine.

710
00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:01.895
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think they were number one.

711
00:31:02.923 --> 00:31:05.992
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, who's heard of Symbolics

712
00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:06.573
<v Tony Wasserman:>these days?

713
00:31:07.104 --> 00:31:07.647
<v Tony Wasserman:>Right.

714
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:11.588
<v Tony Wasserman:>So so it's a question of being

715
00:31:11.608 --> 00:31:12.831
<v Tony Wasserman:>in the right place in the right

716
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.014
<v Tony Wasserman:>time and putting one and one together.

717
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.366
<v Tony Wasserman:>I would say it was fairly opportunistic

718
00:31:17.647 --> 00:31:19.412
<v Tony Wasserman:>because I gave up a tenured faculty

719
00:31:19.432 --> 00:31:19.813
<v Tony Wasserman:>position.

720
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.927
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, that's not easy to leave leave

721
00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:22.671
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>behind for sure.

722
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:26.686
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, you know, we the world was

723
00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:27.127
<v Tony Wasserman:>changing.

724
00:31:28.088 --> 00:31:31.514
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we were able to build

725
00:31:31.574 --> 00:31:34.924
<v Tony Wasserman:>a company that had a really leading

726
00:31:35.004 --> 00:31:38.953
<v Tony Wasserman:>edge technology and it ran on leading

727
00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:39.675
<v Tony Wasserman:>edge hardware.

728
00:31:40.864 --> 00:31:42.449
<v Tony Wasserman:>We had a very good partnership with

729
00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:45.322
<v Tony Wasserman:>Sun Microsystems because we were one of

730
00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.727
<v Tony Wasserman:>their first third party software vendors.

731
00:31:48.729 --> 00:31:53.663
<v Tony Wasserman:>And what the salespeople discovered was that.

732
00:31:55.127 --> 00:31:56.832
<v Tony Wasserman:>When people bought our software, they would

733
00:31:56.852 --> 00:32:00.405
<v Tony Wasserman:>also buy hardware because they would buy

734
00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:03.753
<v Tony Wasserman:>our computer aided software engineering tools and

735
00:32:04.354 --> 00:32:06.062
<v Tony Wasserman:>put it on a Sun workstation and,

736
00:32:06.543 --> 00:32:08.748
<v Tony Wasserman:>you know, equip an engineer that way.

737
00:32:09.589 --> 00:32:12.215
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so the Sun salespeople got the

738
00:32:12.275 --> 00:32:13.041
<v Tony Wasserman:>idea right away.

739
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:15.186
<v Tony Wasserman:>Gee, we should work with Tony and

740
00:32:15.206 --> 00:32:17.632
<v Tony Wasserman:>with IDE because that's a good way

741
00:32:17.693 --> 00:32:19.041
<v Tony Wasserman:>for us to sell hardware.

742
00:32:19.782 --> 00:32:20.122
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

743
00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:22.888
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we had access to Sun offices

744
00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Tony Wasserman:>everywhere.

745
00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:27.560
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there's some very funny stories about

746
00:32:29.003 --> 00:32:31.828
<v Tony Wasserman:>demonstrating our product in China in nineteen

747
00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:35.595
<v Tony Wasserman:>eighty six and in on the Isle

748
00:32:35.635 --> 00:32:41.408
<v Tony Wasserman:>of Capri in Italy or off the

749
00:32:41.449 --> 00:32:44.475
<v Tony Wasserman:>coast in the same time frame.

750
00:32:46.344 --> 00:32:48.448
<v Tony Wasserman:>Getting a machine into these places.

751
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.572
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, that's right.

752
00:32:49.652 --> 00:32:50.293
<v Tony Wasserman:>Especially in the

753
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.402
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>China and the 80s.

754
00:32:51.422 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>How are you going to commandeer it

755
00:32:54.211 --> 00:32:54.873
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>for a demo?

756
00:32:56.023 --> 00:32:56.365
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yes.

757
00:32:56.445 --> 00:32:56.785
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

758
00:32:56.926 --> 00:32:58.732
<v Tony Wasserman:>And physically move it, I would assume.

759
00:32:58.792 --> 00:32:58.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>Right.

760
00:32:59.033 --> 00:32:59.836
<v Tony Wasserman:>Like the you know,

761
00:32:59.884 --> 00:33:01.611
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>because the stuff was pretty fragile.

762
00:33:01.652 --> 00:33:01.813
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Right.

763
00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:02.113
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I mean.

764
00:33:02.114 --> 00:33:02.124
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

765
00:33:02.124 --> 00:33:02.134
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

766
00:33:02.134 --> 00:33:02.171
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I mean, Right.

767
00:33:02.171 --> 00:33:02.191
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I mean.

768
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:02.201
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

769
00:33:02.201 --> 00:33:02.211
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

770
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:04.486
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I mean, it was a big display.

771
00:33:04.486 --> 00:33:04.893
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Right.

772
00:33:04.893 --> 00:33:06.550
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>17 inch display.

773
00:33:10.001 --> 00:33:14.617
<v Tony Wasserman:>And yeah, it was a Motorola 68000

774
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:18.817
<v Tony Wasserman:>processor in there until Sun replaced it

775
00:33:18.857 --> 00:33:19.358
<v Tony Wasserman:>with their own.

776
00:33:19.358 --> 00:33:19.422
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, it with their own.

777
00:33:19.422 --> 00:33:24.172
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, yeah, getting it around was non-trivial.

778
00:33:24.192 --> 00:33:26.878
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, you know, that was fun.

779
00:33:26.918 --> 00:33:27.927
<v Tony Wasserman:>You get to see the world and

780
00:33:27.947 --> 00:33:28.668
<v Tony Wasserman:>do software.

781
00:33:29.231 --> 00:33:30.595
<v Tony Wasserman:>And you had this little bit of

782
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:31.879
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source software in it.

783
00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:32.887
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

784
00:33:32.887 --> 00:33:32.937
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source software in it.

785
00:33:32.937 --> 00:33:32.947
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

786
00:33:33.088 --> 00:33:35.053
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so you were doing open source

787
00:33:35.074 --> 00:33:36.999
<v Tony Wasserman:>software before there was open source software,

788
00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:37.985
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>as open source software, as we established.

789
00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:40.733
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>When did you first hear people start

790
00:33:40.753 --> 00:33:43.546
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>to talk about open source, use the

791
00:33:43.566 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>phrase open source software?

792
00:33:45.472 --> 00:33:47.177
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Well, what you heard first was free

793
00:33:47.197 --> 00:33:47.697
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>software.

794
00:33:47.698 --> 00:33:47.768
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Because you had RMS, Richard Stallman at

795
00:33:47.768 --> 00:33:47.818
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>MIT, first was free software.

796
00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:47.888
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Because you had RMS, Richard Stallman at

797
00:33:47.888 --> 00:33:49.645
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>MIT, who thought that all software should

798
00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:50.226
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>be free.

799
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.461
<v Tony Wasserman:>And he may still think that.

800
00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:58.302
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so you have, you know, the

801
00:33:58.322 --> 00:34:00.844
<v Tony Wasserman:>GNU project with its C compiler and

802
00:34:00.925 --> 00:34:11.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>some of the tools.

803
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:12.904
<v Tony Wasserman:>And you had Richard, who was very

804
00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:14.909
<v Tony Wasserman:>adamant about the problem that he was

805
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.784
<v Tony Wasserman:>encountering with a Canon laser printer, because

806
00:34:20.804 --> 00:34:22.330
<v Tony Wasserman:>he had no access to the source

807
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:22.429
<v Tony Wasserman:>code.

808
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:24.661
<v Tony Wasserman:>This is.

809
00:34:24.761 --> 00:34:26.304
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so this led to the Free

810
00:34:26.344 --> 00:34:29.291
<v Tony Wasserman:>Software Foundation in the mid 1980s.

811
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.982
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so this notion of free software

812
00:34:33.043 --> 00:34:33.543
<v Tony Wasserman:>was out there.

813
00:34:34.344 --> 00:34:36.609
<v Tony Wasserman:>And while it was absolutely okay with

814
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:44.185
<v Tony Wasserman:>them, that people made money from software,

815
00:34:44.245 --> 00:34:45.948
<v Tony Wasserman:>the it wasn't really the whole notion

816
00:34:46.529 --> 00:34:53.306
<v Tony Wasserman:>wasn't pitched at companies and suggesting that

817
00:34:53.346 --> 00:34:53.826
<v Tony Wasserman:>they use open source.

818
00:34:53.847 --> 00:34:56.860
<v Tony Wasserman:>So it wasn't really until after the

819
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.122
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source initiative got created, and the

820
00:34:58.142 --> 00:34:59.804
<v Tony Wasserman:>Apache agreement was made with IBM for

821
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.643
<v Tony Wasserman:>Apache to be part of their Java

822
00:35:11.823 --> 00:35:14.227
<v Tony Wasserman:>Enterprise Edition product, that the term open

823
00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:24.066
<v Tony Wasserman:>source began to to get circulated and

824
00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:24.366
<v Tony Wasserman:>used.

825
00:35:24.427 --> 00:35:25.109
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I would say it was right

826
00:35:25.129 --> 00:35:27.326
<v Tony Wasserman:>about the turn of the millennium when,

827
00:35:27.326 --> 00:35:27.396
<v Tony Wasserman:>when I became more of the millennium

828
00:35:27.396 --> 00:35:27.661
<v Tony Wasserman:>when, when I became more aware of

829
00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:27.821
<v Tony Wasserman:>it.

830
00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:29.003
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then by then I had, you

831
00:35:29.404 --> 00:35:39.944
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, IDE had been merged with some

832
00:35:39.964 --> 00:35:43.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>other companies, because our investors thought that

833
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.181
<v Tony Wasserman:>was the thing to do.

834
00:35:47.241 --> 00:35:49.064
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so I left and I joined

835
00:35:49.124 --> 00:35:50.846
<v Tony Wasserman:>a startup, which wasn't going to be

836
00:35:50.867 --> 00:35:51.849
<v Tony Wasserman:>successful.

837
00:35:58.785 --> 00:36:03.594
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I learned Java Enterprise Edition at

838
00:36:03.634 --> 00:36:04.214
<v Tony Wasserman:>that point.

839
00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:06.479
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that got me to my next

840
00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:06.620
<v Tony Wasserman:>job, which was with a great small

841
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.026
<v Tony Wasserman:>company And that got me to my

842
00:36:07.026 --> 00:36:07.096
<v Tony Wasserman:>next job, which was with a great

843
00:36:07.096 --> 00:36:08.108
<v Tony Wasserman:>small company called Bluestone Software.

844
00:36:08.489 --> 00:36:11.562
<v Tony Wasserman:>They were based, they were based in

845
00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:12.784
<v Tony Wasserman:>South Jersey.

846
00:36:12.844 --> 00:36:13.225
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oh, my gosh.

847
00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:17.071
<v Tony Wasserman:>So you don't associate New Jersey with

848
00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:18.294
<v Tony Wasserman:>software.

849
00:36:18.314 --> 00:36:22.125
<v Tony Wasserman:>No, not, not, it's not, it's not

850
00:36:22.907 --> 00:36:25.352
<v Tony Wasserman:>the Silicon Valley of the East, for

851
00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:25.673
<v Tony Wasserman:>sure.

852
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:28.058
<v Tony Wasserman:>But they were the best Java software

853
00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:34.893
<v Tony Wasserman:>for miles in any direction, including creeping

854
00:36:34.953 --> 00:36:37.197
<v Tony Wasserman:>into Pennsylvania, which wasn't all that far

855
00:36:37.257 --> 00:36:37.477
<v Tony Wasserman:>away.

856
00:36:37.497 --> 00:36:38.449
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so so I ran their West

857
00:36:38.449 --> 00:36:39.746
<v Tony Wasserman:>Coast Development Lab, far away.

858
00:36:39.746 --> 00:36:39.816
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so so I ran their West

859
00:36:39.816 --> 00:36:41.390
<v Tony Wasserman:>Coast Development Lab, and we built tools

860
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:50.415
<v Tony Wasserman:>that were actually to run on mobile

861
00:36:50.436 --> 00:36:51.939
<v Tony Wasserman:>devices to talk to a Java Enterprise

862
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Tony Wasserman:>server.

863
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.150
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we gave away, and we gave

864
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.180
<v Tony Wasserman:>away the code.

865
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>devices to talk to a Java Enterprise

866
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Tony Wasserman:>server.

867
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.330
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we gave away, and we gave

868
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:52.360
<v Tony Wasserman:>away the code.

869
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.886
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay, under the terms of a license,

870
00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:57.207
<v Tony Wasserman:>I'm assuming.

871
00:36:57.227 --> 00:36:57.267
<v Tony Wasserman:>No.

872
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Okay.

873
00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:01.083
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So, because by that time,

874
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.984
<v Tony Wasserman:>Bluestone had sold itself to Hewlett Packard.

875
00:37:08.004 --> 00:37:10.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so when we wanted to give

876
00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:18.223
<v Tony Wasserman:>away the software, they said, Oh, yeah,

877
00:37:18.243 --> 00:37:19.365
<v Tony Wasserman:>yeah, you can give it away.

878
00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:19.846
<v Tony Wasserman:>You can.

879
00:37:19.886 --> 00:37:20.888
<v Tony Wasserman:>But they had no clue of that

880
00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:31.209
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source at that point, which is

881
00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:34.114
<v Tony Wasserman:>funny, because Hewlett Packard was one of

882
00:37:34.154 --> 00:37:37.585
<v Tony Wasserman:>the true leaders in open source and

883
00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:40.511
<v Tony Wasserman:>in adoption of open source, their group

884
00:37:40.552 --> 00:37:41.734
<v Tony Wasserman:>in Colorado Springs.

885
00:37:43.243 --> 00:37:46.269
<v Tony Wasserman:>Some very well known people in the

886
00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:48.694
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source community were there, Stormy Peters,

887
00:37:50.562 --> 00:37:53.348
<v Tony Wasserman:>who you probably know from her stint

888
00:37:53.509 --> 00:37:56.214
<v Tony Wasserman:>at Microsoft and at GitHub.

889
00:37:57.883 --> 00:37:59.886
<v Tony Wasserman:>Phil Robb, who runs open source for

890
00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:02.009
<v Tony Wasserman:>Ericsson here in the United States.

891
00:38:03.653 --> 00:38:06.081
<v Tony Wasserman:>And several other people, I mean, there

892
00:38:06.101 --> 00:38:08.627
<v Tony Wasserman:>was a really, they were really avant

893
00:38:08.687 --> 00:38:11.053
<v Tony Wasserman:>garde, if you will, when it comes

894
00:38:11.394 --> 00:38:16.323
<v Tony Wasserman:>to They built the whole Fossology lab.

895
00:38:17.245 --> 00:38:19.087
<v Tony Wasserman:>But this other little corner of Hewlett

896
00:38:19.128 --> 00:38:23.094
<v Tony Wasserman:>Packard didn't do open source.

897
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.261
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we gave away the source code,

898
00:38:25.322 --> 00:38:27.306
<v Tony Wasserman:>but it didn't have an open source

899
00:38:27.366 --> 00:38:27.767
<v Tony Wasserman:>license.

900
00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:31.155
<v Tony Wasserman:>So in theory, we retained the copyright

901
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.466
<v Tony Wasserman:>to it.

902
00:38:34.148 --> 00:38:36.212
<v Tony Wasserman:>Actually, in practice, we retained the copyright

903
00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:36.494
<v Tony Wasserman:>to it.

904
00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:38.343
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

905
00:38:38.844 --> 00:38:41.790
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So you mentioned a couple names of

906
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.153
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>folks, you know, from those days.

907
00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:47.387
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What do you remember about your early

908
00:38:47.427 --> 00:38:49.772
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>encounters, I guess, with people in the

909
00:38:49.852 --> 00:38:53.107
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>open source ecosystem early on when it

910
00:38:53.147 --> 00:38:53.910
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>was in its genesis?

911
00:38:55.382 --> 00:38:58.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, part of that, of course, is

912
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.415
<v Tony Wasserman:>based on what we mean by genesis.

913
00:39:00.983 --> 00:39:01.848
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, right.

914
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.424
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, I mean, there are people

915
00:39:03.464 --> 00:39:05.891
<v Tony Wasserman:>who were there at the very beginning,

916
00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:11.326
<v Tony Wasserman:>Bruce Perens, for example, and Brian Bellendorf,

917
00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:14.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>who was at CollabNet.

918
00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:19.317
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I didn't meet them till later.

919
00:39:21.183 --> 00:39:24.029
<v Tony Wasserman:>And because I hadn't really sunk into

920
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.971
<v Tony Wasserman:>that community yet.

921
00:39:25.612 --> 00:39:32.027
<v Tony Wasserman:>But what happened was, in 2004, I

922
00:39:32.087 --> 00:39:36.995
<v Tony Wasserman:>was running product development for another startup

923
00:39:37.015 --> 00:39:38.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>that was not going to be successful.

924
00:39:39.063 --> 00:39:42.252
<v Tony Wasserman:>But you know, 90% of them failed.

925
00:39:42.333 --> 00:39:43.035
<v Tony Wasserman:>So okay.

926
00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:44.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

927
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:45.869
<v Tony Wasserman:>It wasn't my startup.

928
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.986
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, yeah.

929
00:39:48.501 --> 00:39:49.702
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

930
00:39:50.383 --> 00:39:53.346
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was two guys who had,

931
00:39:53.507 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think, a promising idea.

932
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Tony Wasserman:>And they built the company, they built

933
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.305
<v Tony Wasserman:>the product, and the company stuck around

934
00:40:05.365 --> 00:40:06.126
<v Tony Wasserman:>for a little while.

935
00:40:07.209 --> 00:40:09.233
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I didn't.

936
00:40:09.233 --> 00:40:12.966
<v Tony Wasserman:>In 2004, it turns out I went

937
00:40:12.986 --> 00:40:15.293
<v Tony Wasserman:>to the International Conference on Software Engineering

938
00:40:16.762 --> 00:40:18.685
<v Tony Wasserman:>in Edinburgh.

939
00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:23.191
<v Tony Wasserman:>And one of the people that I

940
00:40:23.312 --> 00:40:26.416
<v Tony Wasserman:>ran into there, I've been going to

941
00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:29.006
<v Tony Wasserman:>these international conferences on software engineering since

942
00:40:29.046 --> 00:40:32.154
<v Tony Wasserman:>the very first one in the mid

943
00:40:32.174 --> 00:40:32.194
<v Tony Wasserman:>70s.

944
00:40:34.404 --> 00:40:35.486
<v Tony Wasserman:>So one of the people I met

945
00:40:35.506 --> 00:40:37.711
<v Tony Wasserman:>there was Martin Griss, who I had

946
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:38.653
<v Tony Wasserman:>known for many years.

947
00:40:39.314 --> 00:40:41.043
<v Tony Wasserman:>He ran the research lab at Hewlett

948
00:40:41.083 --> 00:40:42.226
<v Tony Wasserman:>Packard for a long time.

949
00:40:43.148 --> 00:40:48.764
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then he had just joined the

950
00:40:49.064 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Tony Wasserman:>brand new Carnegie Mellon campus that's in

951
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:55.276
<v Tony Wasserman:>Silicon Valley, which for people who know

952
00:40:55.316 --> 00:40:58.625
<v Tony Wasserman:>the geography, is on the NASA Ames

953
00:40:58.665 --> 00:41:00.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>Research Park in Mountain View.

954
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.220
<v Tony Wasserman:>So Martin says to me, hey, you

955
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.227
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, we're doing, we're getting this academic

956
00:41:08.288 --> 00:41:11.562
<v Tony Wasserman:>program in software engineering started out here.

957
00:41:11.582 --> 00:41:13.267
<v Tony Wasserman:>Why don't you come around and take

958
00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:13.648
<v Tony Wasserman:>a look.

959
00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:15.994
<v Tony Wasserman:>One thing led to another.

960
00:41:17.242 --> 00:41:21.028
<v Tony Wasserman:>And in 2005, I joined the faculty

961
00:41:21.609 --> 00:41:21.909
<v Tony Wasserman:>there.

962
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.896
<v Tony Wasserman:>And one of the things that came

963
00:41:25.976 --> 00:41:28.344
<v Tony Wasserman:>out of that was that I wanted

964
00:41:28.424 --> 00:41:31.511
<v Tony Wasserman:>to be able to establish a research

965
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.779
<v Tony Wasserman:>program in addition to the course that

966
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.261
<v Tony Wasserman:>I taught.

967
00:41:35.022 --> 00:41:38.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so for a research topic, I

968
00:41:38.568 --> 00:41:39.489
<v Tony Wasserman:>picked open source.

969
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.491
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

970
00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:47.567
<v Tony Wasserman:>And not building open source code so

971
00:41:47.607 --> 00:41:51.234
<v Tony Wasserman:>much as evaluation and adoption and use

972
00:41:51.274 --> 00:41:52.035
<v Tony Wasserman:>of open source.

973
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:52.800
<v Tony Wasserman:>I see.

974
00:41:53.141 --> 00:41:53.442
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

975
00:41:54.464 --> 00:41:58.231
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so, you know, I went off

976
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:00.475
<v Tony Wasserman:>and started talking to people at the

977
00:42:00.535 --> 00:42:00.915
<v Tony Wasserman:>time.

978
00:42:02.362 --> 00:42:07.071
<v Tony Wasserman:>Microsoft was, of course, totally dominant in

979
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:09.996
<v Tony Wasserman:>the software industry, both in terms of

980
00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:14.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>the Windows operating system and also with

981
00:42:14.628 --> 00:42:15.971
<v Tony Wasserman:>Microsoft Office Suite.

982
00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:20.022
<v Tony Wasserman:>So you really didn't do much computing

983
00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.589
<v Tony Wasserman:>on the desktop without Microsoft.

984
00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:26.655
<v Tony Wasserman:>So one of the first places I

985
00:42:27.982 --> 00:42:30.969
<v Tony Wasserman:>looked was at Microsoft to see what

986
00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:31.590
<v Tony Wasserman:>they were doing.

987
00:42:32.392 --> 00:42:34.100
<v Tony Wasserman:>At the time, Steve Ballmer, who was

988
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:39.328
<v Tony Wasserman:>their CEO at the time, was saying

989
00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:42.975
<v Tony Wasserman:>things like the open source is a

990
00:42:43.035 --> 00:42:43.516
<v Tony Wasserman:>cancer.

991
00:42:45.343 --> 00:42:47.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>Open source is a communist plot.

992
00:42:48.128 --> 00:42:50.051
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, here are all these people

993
00:42:50.131 --> 00:42:55.063
<v Tony Wasserman:>in t-shirts hanging out in, you know,

994
00:42:55.164 --> 00:42:57.748
<v Tony Wasserman:>in rooms writing code and sharing it

995
00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:00.011
<v Tony Wasserman:>and giving it away when it has

996
00:43:00.032 --> 00:43:00.233
<v Tony Wasserman:>value.

997
00:43:05.703 --> 00:43:07.226
<v Tony Wasserman:>But it turns out that they had

998
00:43:07.246 --> 00:43:12.455
<v Tony Wasserman:>a guy who was responsible for monitoring

999
00:43:12.495 --> 00:43:13.921
<v Tony Wasserman:>what was going on in open source.

1000
00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:15.705
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I met him.

1001
00:43:17.348 --> 00:43:19.111
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then he didn't last all that

1002
00:43:19.172 --> 00:43:19.472
<v Tony Wasserman:>long.

1003
00:43:19.893 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then the next person in that

1004
00:43:21.941 --> 00:43:25.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>link was Sam Ramji, who has been,

1005
00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:27.671
<v Tony Wasserman:>I think, a key part of the

1006
00:43:28.092 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source community for a long time.

1007
00:43:31.763 --> 00:43:33.847
<v Tony Wasserman:>And he's still active.

1008
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.794
<v Tony Wasserman:>Anyway, so in addition to that, we

1009
00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:39.643
<v Tony Wasserman:>were beginning to see a number of

1010
00:43:40.946 --> 00:43:42.348
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source projects pop up.

1011
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.455
<v Tony Wasserman:>One of the best known is MySQL,

1012
00:43:48.503 --> 00:43:49.745
<v Tony Wasserman:>which started in the mid 90s, 1994.

1013
00:43:49.745 --> 00:43:51.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we also saw the huge growth

1014
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:58.116
<v Tony Wasserman:>of Linux, which started from 1991.

1015
00:43:58.684 --> 00:44:02.591
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Red Hat, your former employer, you

1016
00:44:02.611 --> 00:44:06.299
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, started doing Linux in 1994 or

1017
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:06.620
<v Tony Wasserman:>so.

1018
00:44:08.623 --> 00:44:11.888
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so there was this momentum started

1019
00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:12.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>to build up.

1020
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:17.441
<v Tony Wasserman:>But so these were, you know, things

1021
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:19.766
<v Tony Wasserman:>that were, I think, very influential in

1022
00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:22.433
<v Tony Wasserman:>driving the Unix community, or the Linux

1023
00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:24.261
<v Tony Wasserman:>community and the open source community.

1024
00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:27.649
<v Tony Wasserman:>We began to see conferences.

1025
00:44:29.373 --> 00:44:31.181
<v Tony Wasserman:>It was the open source business conference,

1026
00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:35.531
<v Tony Wasserman:>which was focused on commercial adoption.

1027
00:44:36.012 --> 00:44:37.615
<v Tony Wasserman:>There was the open source think tank,

1028
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.487
<v Tony Wasserman:>which was this much smaller meeting, chaired

1029
00:44:41.547 --> 00:44:45.455
<v Tony Wasserman:>by Andrew Aitken, who eventually ended up

1030
00:44:45.615 --> 00:44:48.104
<v Tony Wasserman:>running the open source business for Wipro,

1031
00:44:50.067 --> 00:44:51.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>the Indian services company.

1032
00:44:53.253 --> 00:44:55.300
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so, you know, these names keep

1033
00:44:56.282 --> 00:45:01.149
<v Tony Wasserman:>reappearing, popping up, yeah, as people move

1034
00:45:01.189 --> 00:45:01.670
<v Tony Wasserman:>around.

1035
00:45:03.773 --> 00:45:05.676
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so you had, you also had

1036
00:45:05.716 --> 00:45:07.203
<v Tony Wasserman:>the wiki movement, there were a number

1037
00:45:07.223 --> 00:45:10.372
<v Tony Wasserman:>of different wikis that came about, of

1038
00:45:10.412 --> 00:45:11.861
<v Tony Wasserman:>which the best known, of course, is

1039
00:45:11.921 --> 00:45:13.864
<v Tony Wasserman:>MediaWiki because of Wikipedia.

1040
00:45:16.209 --> 00:45:19.114
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so there's a challenge that I

1041
00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:22.625
<v Tony Wasserman:>formulated at that time, which is how

1042
00:45:22.705 --> 00:45:27.234
<v Tony Wasserman:>much can you do with only open

1043
00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:27.995
<v Tony Wasserman:>source software?

1044
00:45:29.222 --> 00:45:33.610
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Okay, so, so OpenOffice was there, right?

1045
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.976
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It wasn't as compatible with Microsoft Office,

1046
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.382
<v Tony Wasserman:>then as it is now.

1047
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:42.510
<v Tony Wasserman:>Of course, LibreOffice also was a fork

1048
00:45:42.571 --> 00:45:43.031
<v Tony Wasserman:>from that.

1049
00:45:43.893 --> 00:45:46.121
<v Tony Wasserman:>There were early content management systems.

1050
00:45:49.968 --> 00:45:50.549
<v Tony Wasserman:>Joomla!

1051
00:45:50.629 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Tony Wasserman:>and Drupal.

1052
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.993
<v Tony Wasserman:>Drupal, of course, is still around.

1053
00:45:53.393 --> 00:45:55.941
<v Tony Wasserman:>Drupal has a huge community, has been

1054
00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:56.823
<v Tony Wasserman:>a huge success.

1055
00:45:57.365 --> 00:46:01.193
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, it was actually Dries Voithoudt's

1056
00:46:01.293 --> 00:46:02.375
<v Tony Wasserman:>PhD dissertation.

1057
00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:03.745
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yes, that's right.

1058
00:46:03.786 --> 00:46:04.207
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>That's right.

1059
00:46:04.247 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah, yeah.

1060
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:05.272
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Okay.

1061
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.448
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so, but what we, so those

1062
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:12.733
<v Tony Wasserman:>are kind of the grassroots of a

1063
00:46:12.753 --> 00:46:15.082
<v Tony Wasserman:>lot of open source, and people were

1064
00:46:15.122 --> 00:46:19.052
<v Tony Wasserman:>putting open source on a shared repository,

1065
00:46:19.253 --> 00:46:19.854
<v Tony Wasserman:>SourceForge.

1066
00:46:21.482 --> 00:46:24.648
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So SourceForge was the GitHub of its

1067
00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.088
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>day.

1068
00:46:27.172 --> 00:46:29.895
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And again, SourceForge still exists, but

1069
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Tony Wasserman:>obviously has been dwarfed by the adoption

1070
00:46:35.972 --> 00:46:37.776
<v Tony Wasserman:>and widespread use of GitHub.

1071
00:46:39.604 --> 00:46:42.851
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, you know, not everything dies, it

1072
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:44.535
<v Tony Wasserman:>just kind of hangs around for a

1073
00:46:44.615 --> 00:46:44.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>while.

1074
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.323
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, right, right.

1075
00:46:46.784 --> 00:46:49.690
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, then, when did you, when did

1076
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.015
<v Tony Wasserman:>you know that you wanted to play

1077
00:46:52.055 --> 00:46:52.295
<v Tony Wasserman:>a more

1078
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.429
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>pivotal role in influencing the, in stewarding

1079
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:57.031
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>open source?

1080
00:46:57.071 --> 00:46:58.955
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You were, you joined the OSI at

1081
00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.681
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>some point, right?

1082
00:47:00.403 --> 00:47:01.385
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So that was a little later.

1083
00:47:01.405 --> 00:47:05.694
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Because OSI didn't have affiliate members,

1084
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>and they didn't have individual members for

1085
00:47:08.466 --> 00:47:09.028
<v Tony Wasserman:>a long time.

1086
00:47:09.469 --> 00:47:13.182
<v Tony Wasserman:>But in 2005, my first year at

1087
00:47:13.282 --> 00:47:16.929
<v Tony Wasserman:>Carnegie Mellon, I organized a conference on

1088
00:47:17.049 --> 00:47:20.175
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source software in the Bay Area,

1089
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.325
<v Tony Wasserman:>and we got 100 or so people,

1090
00:47:23.465 --> 00:47:25.908
<v Tony Wasserman:>and I managed to get some, you

1091
00:47:26.631 --> 00:47:29.961
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, luminaries in, in open source, Denise

1092
00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:31.625
<v Tony Wasserman:>Cooper was one of our speakers, for

1093
00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:34.192
<v Tony Wasserman:>example, and she's certainly very well known

1094
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.226
<v Tony Wasserman:>for her long term contributions in open

1095
00:47:38.266 --> 00:47:38.547
<v Tony Wasserman:>source.

1096
00:47:40.971 --> 00:47:43.195
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so, you know, that was the

1097
00:47:43.215 --> 00:47:45.903
<v Tony Wasserman:>thing that told me that this was

1098
00:47:46.804 --> 00:47:50.731
<v Tony Wasserman:>what's happening now, that this movement toward

1099
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:54.121
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source was happening, it was happening

1100
00:47:54.201 --> 00:47:54.642
<v Tony Wasserman:>slowly.

1101
00:47:55.564 --> 00:47:58.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because at that time, and maybe for

1102
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.174
<v Tony Wasserman:>the next four or five years after

1103
00:48:01.215 --> 00:48:04.848
<v Tony Wasserman:>that, there were camps, that there were

1104
00:48:04.888 --> 00:48:07.634
<v Tony Wasserman:>people who believed in open source, and

1105
00:48:07.654 --> 00:48:08.901
<v Tony Wasserman:>they didn't want to send any money

1106
00:48:08.982 --> 00:48:13.010
<v Tony Wasserman:>to Redmond, Washington, or to Redwood Shores,

1107
00:48:13.051 --> 00:48:16.261
<v Tony Wasserman:>California, or other places that were homes

1108
00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:19.068
<v Tony Wasserman:>to major proprietary software businesses.

1109
00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:22.134
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then, of course, you had the

1110
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.805
<v Tony Wasserman:>other side, which are the large companies

1111
00:48:25.286 --> 00:48:28.493
<v Tony Wasserman:>that said, you know, they believed what

1112
00:48:28.513 --> 00:48:31.724
<v Tony Wasserman:>Microsoft said, or they got everything that

1113
00:48:31.764 --> 00:48:36.252
<v Tony Wasserman:>they needed from proprietary software, and had

1114
00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:37.701
<v Tony Wasserman:>no use for open source.

1115
00:48:39.004 --> 00:48:40.567
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the executives in some of those

1116
00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:43.394
<v Tony Wasserman:>companies would say, we don't use open

1117
00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:43.775
<v Tony Wasserman:>source.

1118
00:48:45.104 --> 00:48:47.109
<v Tony Wasserman:>And my answer to them was, you

1119
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.770
<v Tony Wasserman:>want to bet?

1120
00:48:48.373 --> 00:48:48.955
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

1121
00:48:51.944 --> 00:48:52.264
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yep.

1122
00:48:53.226 --> 00:48:55.631
<v Tony Wasserman:>And you know, at that time, you

1123
00:48:55.711 --> 00:48:58.115
<v Tony Wasserman:>had the emergence of companies like Black

1124
00:48:58.155 --> 00:49:02.687
<v Tony Wasserman:>Duck, which were out there analyzing source

1125
00:49:02.748 --> 00:49:06.033
<v Tony Wasserman:>code and looking for open source software

1126
00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:10.067
<v Tony Wasserman:>in those larger systems.

1127
00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:12.513
<v Tony Wasserman:>And surprise, surprise, there was a lot

1128
00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:13.134
<v Tony Wasserman:>of it out there.

1129
00:49:14.944 --> 00:49:17.309
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, of course, Black Duck has evolved

1130
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.933
<v Tony Wasserman:>and been acquired, and they're now part

1131
00:49:18.973 --> 00:49:19.694
<v Tony Wasserman:>of Synopsys.

1132
00:49:20.721 --> 00:49:27.388
<v Tony Wasserman:>I don't know if I knew that.

1133
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:29.291
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

1134
00:49:29.311 --> 00:49:31.253
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there was this division.

1135
00:49:31.994 --> 00:49:36.183
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it wasn't until considerably later, maybe

1136
00:49:36.263 --> 00:49:42.292
<v Tony Wasserman:>after the 2008 Great Recession, that some

1137
00:49:42.333 --> 00:49:44.819
<v Tony Wasserman:>of these companies said, you know, we

1138
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.525
<v Tony Wasserman:>have all this work to do, and

1139
00:49:46.585 --> 00:49:48.129
<v Tony Wasserman:>our budgets have all been cut.

1140
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.054
<v Tony Wasserman:>Let's go take a look at this

1141
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.826
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source stuff, which is free.

1142
00:49:54.667 --> 00:49:56.611
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that's what they did.

1143
00:49:57.633 --> 00:49:59.496
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we saw, we began to

1144
00:49:59.556 --> 00:50:03.267
<v Tony Wasserman:>see gradual adoption of open source in

1145
00:50:03.347 --> 00:50:03.808
<v Tony Wasserman:>companies.

1146
00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:07.315
<v Tony Wasserman:>And this is that place where what

1147
00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:09.403
<v Tony Wasserman:>I was doing, evaluation and adoption of

1148
00:50:09.483 --> 00:50:14.154
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source, really became a central activity,

1149
00:50:14.234 --> 00:50:14.535
<v Tony Wasserman:>all these.

1150
00:50:16.423 --> 00:50:17.545
<v Tony Wasserman:>It took a long time.

1151
00:50:17.626 --> 00:50:20.691
<v Tony Wasserman:>And in fact, it's still in process.

1152
00:50:21.293 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Tony Wasserman:>But to get the analysts, the industry

1153
00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:26.165
<v Tony Wasserman:>analysts, like the partners of the world,

1154
00:50:27.068 --> 00:50:31.001
<v Tony Wasserman:>to when they do their evaluation, their

1155
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:32.066
<v Tony Wasserman:>four quadrants.

1156
00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.271
<v Tony Wasserman:>The other quadrant, yeah.

1157
00:50:34.022 --> 00:50:36.268
<v Tony Wasserman:>So how do you get open source

1158
00:50:36.328 --> 00:50:38.874
<v Tony Wasserman:>software products into the upper quadrant?

1159
00:50:41.546 --> 00:50:42.869
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Because otherwise, they'd be in the lower

1160
00:50:42.929 --> 00:50:43.451
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>left, right?

1161
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:44.573
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>They don't have the structural

1162
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.325
<v Tony Wasserman:>organization of the company, they don't have

1163
00:50:46.466 --> 00:50:48.633
<v Tony Wasserman:>the revenue, they don't have the roadmap,

1164
00:50:48.633 --> 00:50:49.842
<v Tony Wasserman:>they they don't have the support.

1165
00:50:51.786 --> 00:50:53.629
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so what turns out, as we

1166
00:50:53.971 --> 00:50:56.962
<v Tony Wasserman:>can say, looking backward, is that some

1167
00:50:57.002 --> 00:50:59.547
<v Tony Wasserman:>of the most successful open source companies

1168
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:04.502
<v Tony Wasserman:>became that way by creating companies that

1169
00:51:04.663 --> 00:51:05.784
<v Tony Wasserman:>used that software.

1170
00:51:06.666 --> 00:51:11.314
<v Tony Wasserman:>So Drupal, for example, the founders of

1171
00:51:11.354 --> 00:51:13.221
<v Tony Wasserman:>Drupal set up a company called Acquia.

1172
00:51:14.663 --> 00:51:18.130
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Acquia provides a very good level

1173
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:24.864
<v Tony Wasserman:>of hosting and commercial support for Drupal.

1174
00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:27.289
<v Tony Wasserman:>You have the same thing with Cassandra

1175
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.455
<v Tony Wasserman:>and Hadoop, where there are companies that

1176
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.863
<v Tony Wasserman:>provide that support.

1177
00:51:32.385 --> 00:51:33.488
<v Tony Wasserman:>But now to come back to your

1178
00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:37.744
<v Tony Wasserman:>question about open source and the OSI.

1179
00:51:38.986 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Tony Wasserman:>So the OSI, of course, was founded

1180
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.471
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 1998.

1181
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:45.756
<v Tony Wasserman:>And they had a board of directors.

1182
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.165
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the board of directors, of course,

1183
00:51:49.205 --> 00:51:53.933
<v Tony Wasserman:>was started by Bruce Perens and by

1184
00:51:53.973 --> 00:51:54.594
<v Tony Wasserman:>Eric Raymond.

1185
00:51:56.381 --> 00:52:01.092
<v Tony Wasserman:>And what's his name from Red Hat?

1186
00:52:02.434 --> 00:52:02.956
<v Tony Wasserman:>Michael Tiemann.

1187
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:04.522
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yes, thank you.

1188
00:52:05.484 --> 00:52:09.611
<v Tony Wasserman:>So Michael Tiemann, and then other people

1189
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:11.233
<v Tony Wasserman:>were appointed.

1190
00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:14.842
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it was kind of a closed

1191
00:52:14.862 --> 00:52:15.923
<v Tony Wasserman:>system.

1192
00:52:15.943 --> 00:52:18.427
<v Tony Wasserman:>And in 2010, when they appointed new

1193
00:52:19.608 --> 00:52:30.646
<v Tony Wasserman:>members, invited to join and accepted.

1194
00:52:31.668 --> 00:52:34.973
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Simon Phipps also came out at

1195
00:52:35.013 --> 00:52:36.634
<v Tony Wasserman:>the same time as I did.

1196
00:52:37.096 --> 00:52:39.323
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Simon had been at Sun Microsystems.

1197
00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:46.835
<v Tony Wasserman:>But he has, these days, a very

1198
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:52.468
<v Tony Wasserman:>successful open source consulting practice and does

1199
00:52:52.489 --> 00:52:55.875
<v Tony Wasserman:>some work for European governments and for

1200
00:52:55.895 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Tony Wasserman:>the UK government.

1201
00:52:58.403 --> 00:53:01.488
<v Tony Wasserman:>So a couple of things during our

1202
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.850
<v Tony Wasserman:>tenure.

1203
00:53:03.611 --> 00:53:06.396
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I was on the board for

1204
00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.844
<v Tony Wasserman:>two terms, you know, I was termed

1205
00:53:08.964 --> 00:53:09.305
<v Tony Wasserman:>out, right?

1206
00:53:09.325 --> 00:53:10.407
<v Tony Wasserman:>That was the legal maximum.

1207
00:53:12.352 --> 00:53:13.634
<v Tony Wasserman:>But a few things happened.

1208
00:53:13.755 --> 00:53:17.406
<v Tony Wasserman:>First of all, Simon really drove the

1209
00:53:17.547 --> 00:53:20.494
<v Tony Wasserman:>idea of an affiliate program, so that

1210
00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:22.080
<v Tony Wasserman:>many of the other groups that were

1211
00:53:22.122 --> 00:53:24.968
<v Tony Wasserman:>doing open source software, and many of

1212
00:53:25.028 --> 00:53:30.505
<v Tony Wasserman:>the foundations doing open source software became

1213
00:53:30.545 --> 00:53:32.028
<v Tony Wasserman:>affiliates of the OSI.

1214
00:53:32.128 --> 00:53:35.254
<v Tony Wasserman:>So that, and that had the, you

1215
00:53:35.835 --> 00:53:38.444
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, that led to improved communication, and

1216
00:53:38.484 --> 00:53:43.273
<v Tony Wasserman:>it led to people being able to

1217
00:53:43.573 --> 00:53:45.557
<v Tony Wasserman:>represent open source more as a group

1218
00:53:45.617 --> 00:53:48.945
<v Tony Wasserman:>than as each individual foundation.

1219
00:53:49.005 --> 00:53:56.276
<v Tony Wasserman:>So getting and eventually, the affiliates, some

1220
00:53:56.296 --> 00:53:57.682
<v Tony Wasserman:>of them contributed money and money and

1221
00:53:58.925 --> 00:54:00.408
<v Tony Wasserman:>so one of the other good things

1222
00:54:00.429 --> 00:54:01.772
<v Tony Wasserman:>that happened is that we were able

1223
00:54:01.813 --> 00:54:05.143
<v Tony Wasserman:>to hire in the OSI, a general

1224
00:54:05.183 --> 00:54:05.604
<v Tony Wasserman:>manager.

1225
00:54:08.468 --> 00:54:13.855
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that was useful, because now you

1226
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:17.585
<v Tony Wasserman:>had somebody whose job it was, primary

1227
00:54:17.645 --> 00:54:21.411
<v Tony Wasserman:>job was to represent the OSI.

1228
00:54:22.013 --> 00:54:25.022
<v Tony Wasserman:>Whereas the rest of us were, you

1229
00:54:25.062 --> 00:54:27.105
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, earning a living doing other things.

1230
00:54:29.489 --> 00:54:32.895
<v Tony Wasserman:>And another thing that happened during that

1231
00:54:33.015 --> 00:54:36.627
<v Tony Wasserman:>era was the creation of individual memberships.

1232
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay.

1233
00:54:38.793 --> 00:54:39.535
<v Tony Wasserman:>In the OSI.

1234
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.906
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oh, right, where an organization could.

1235
00:54:42.548 --> 00:54:42.747
<v Tony Wasserman:>Right.

1236
00:54:42.869 --> 00:54:44.714
<v Tony Wasserman:>As you know, the Free Software Foundation

1237
00:54:44.774 --> 00:54:48.687
<v Tony Wasserman:>has individual members and the Linux Foundation

1238
00:54:48.707 --> 00:54:53.556
<v Tony Wasserman:>has individual members, and other groups as

1239
00:54:53.616 --> 00:54:53.756
<v Tony Wasserman:>well.

1240
00:54:55.181 --> 00:54:57.672
<v Tony Wasserman:>The OSI did not until about 2014,

1241
00:54:58.265 --> 00:55:03.772
<v Tony Wasserman:>maybe, not that long ago.

1242
00:55:04.553 --> 00:55:07.396
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there was not much of a

1243
00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:08.501
<v Tony Wasserman:>marketing program.

1244
00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.808
<v Tony Wasserman:>So they, you know, you'd have a

1245
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:16.605
<v Tony Wasserman:>conference like the O'Reilly conference, where the

1246
00:55:16.645 --> 00:55:18.769
<v Tony Wasserman:>OSI would have a booth and, and

1247
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.234
<v Tony Wasserman:>we tell people, you know, please, please

1248
00:55:22.295 --> 00:55:22.596
<v Tony Wasserman:>join.

1249
00:55:24.606 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Tony Wasserman:>We didn't have all that much to

1250
00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:26.953
<v Tony Wasserman:>give them in return.

1251
00:55:30.404 --> 00:55:33.050
<v Tony Wasserman:>The OSI didn't run its own conferences,

1252
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:35.395
<v Tony Wasserman:>they didn't teach its own courses.

1253
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:39.848
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so the OSI's main mission then

1254
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:42.415
<v Tony Wasserman:>and now has been over license approval.

1255
00:55:43.221 --> 00:55:44.243
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Right, right.

1256
00:55:44.643 --> 00:55:44.844
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

1257
00:55:45.184 --> 00:55:49.372
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And so, and I think that's something

1258
00:55:49.472 --> 00:55:51.596
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>that not only has the OSI done,

1259
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.826
<v Tony Wasserman:>done well, but that the, the open

1260
00:55:54.867 --> 00:55:57.272
<v Tony Wasserman:>source community as a whole, looks to

1261
00:55:57.312 --> 00:56:00.783
<v Tony Wasserman:>the OSI for its leadership and voice

1262
00:56:00.804 --> 00:56:02.607
<v Tony Wasserman:>on that.

1263
00:56:03.248 --> 00:56:03.769
<v Tony Wasserman:>Absolutely.

1264
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:07.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>So if I understand the timeline,

1265
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.027
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>correctly, you know, when you started, you

1266
00:56:10.068 --> 00:56:12.681
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>know, building that program around studying open

1267
00:56:12.721 --> 00:56:16.649
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>source adoption, that was prior to what

1268
00:56:16.689 --> 00:56:18.633
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you kind of signaled as sort of

1269
00:56:18.714 --> 00:56:22.488
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>the more popular mainstream interest in open

1270
00:56:22.508 --> 00:56:24.292
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>source, like, it was prior to the

1271
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:26.102
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Great Recession, which you benchmark as kind

1272
00:56:26.143 --> 00:56:29.330
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of a, that just tells me it's

1273
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.894
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>sort of, you were on, you were

1274
00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.884
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>onto something, right, that you had an

1275
00:56:32.945 --> 00:56:33.206
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>inkling.

1276
00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:35.131
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And I'm wondering what, what was it

1277
00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.162
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>about open source and about the idea

1278
00:56:37.202 --> 00:56:37.944
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of open source?

1279
00:56:39.487 --> 00:56:40.590
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>What did you see at the time

1280
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.002
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>that sparked your passion and curiosity to

1281
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:46.989
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>pursue, build that program and pursue that?

1282
00:56:47.009 --> 00:56:49.435
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It, you know, it just, it tells

1283
00:56:49.475 --> 00:56:51.144
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>me you had, you had insight into

1284
00:56:51.185 --> 00:56:51.867
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>something, right?

1285
00:56:52.107 --> 00:56:53.171
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So there are a couple of things.

1286
00:56:53.532 --> 00:56:54.013
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>First of all,

1287
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.147
<v Tony Wasserman:>in 2005, there was an effort started

1288
00:56:58.207 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Tony Wasserman:>called the Business Readiness Rating.

1289
00:57:00.712 --> 00:57:05.003
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and it was started by SpikeSource,

1290
00:57:05.524 --> 00:57:07.027
<v Tony Wasserman:>which was a startup.

1291
00:57:07.848 --> 00:57:10.712
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the CEO of SpikeSource was Kim

1292
00:57:10.733 --> 00:57:13.562
<v Tony Wasserman:>Polese, who was the first product manager

1293
00:57:13.582 --> 00:57:14.964
<v Tony Wasserman:>for Java at Sun.

1294
00:57:16.669 --> 00:57:18.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>They, all these pieces eventually come back

1295
00:57:18.814 --> 00:57:19.214
<v Tony Wasserman:>together.

1296
00:57:19.215 --> 00:57:20.589
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, Yeah, right, right, right, right, right.

1297
00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and then the, there was funding

1298
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.515
<v Tony Wasserman:>from Intel, a guy named Pete Kronowit,

1299
00:57:30.661 --> 00:57:33.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>who has since left computing to be

1300
00:57:33.626 --> 00:57:34.427
<v Tony Wasserman:>a musician.

1301
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:43.324
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and O'Reilly, Nat forget his last

1302
00:57:43.364 --> 00:57:43.564
<v Tony Wasserman:>name.

1303
00:57:44.927 --> 00:57:49.555
<v Tony Wasserman:>Anyway, Nat was the representative from O'Reilly,

1304
00:57:49.575 --> 00:57:50.700
<v Tony Wasserman:>so that, and then me.

1305
00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Tony Wasserman:>So the, the four groups created this

1306
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:58.093
<v Tony Wasserman:>Business Readiness Rating.

1307
00:57:58.414 --> 00:57:59.839
<v Tony Wasserman:>And as you can imagine, this is

1308
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.325
<v Tony Wasserman:>right up my alley of evaluation and

1309
00:58:02.386 --> 00:58:02.947
<v Tony Wasserman:>adoption.

1310
00:58:05.652 --> 00:58:07.214
<v Tony Wasserman:>What makes a piece of open source

1311
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.826
<v Tony Wasserman:>software ready to be used in a

1312
00:58:09.906 --> 00:58:14.662
<v Tony Wasserman:>business environment, whether that's commercial distribution of

1313
00:58:14.702 --> 00:58:17.409
<v Tony Wasserman:>the software, or inclusion of that software

1314
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.520
<v Tony Wasserman:>in a product that they ship, or

1315
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.003
<v Tony Wasserman:>whether it's internal use.

1316
00:58:22.766 --> 00:58:24.930
<v Tony Wasserman:>So what we did was we came

1317
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.735
<v Tony Wasserman:>out with a set of evaluation criteria.

1318
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.883
<v Tony Wasserman:>Initially, there were a dozen of them.

1319
00:58:31.205 --> 00:58:35.333
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that was a way that you

1320
00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:36.915
<v Tony Wasserman:>could look at a piece of open

1321
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.463
<v Tony Wasserman:>source software and score it on these

1322
00:58:38.503 --> 00:58:44.274
<v Tony Wasserman:>criteria, documentation, the quality of the code,

1323
00:58:44.355 --> 00:58:46.404
<v Tony Wasserman:>the existence of some kind of a

1324
00:58:46.504 --> 00:58:48.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>process for reviewing bugs.

1325
00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:50.694
<v Tony Wasserman:>All these kinds of things could be

1326
00:58:50.774 --> 00:58:52.462
<v Tony Wasserman:>scored on a zero to five scale,

1327
00:58:52.503 --> 00:58:53.384
<v Tony Wasserman:>and you could add up all the

1328
00:58:53.424 --> 00:58:54.467
<v Tony Wasserman:>numbers and weight them.

1329
00:58:57.813 --> 00:59:00.243
<v Tony Wasserman:>But it turned out, when you think

1330
00:59:00.283 --> 00:59:02.749
<v Tony Wasserman:>about it, that you didn't have to

1331
00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:03.872
<v Tony Wasserman:>do a lot of work to know

1332
00:59:03.912 --> 00:59:07.565
<v Tony Wasserman:>which ones were really ready for commercial

1333
00:59:07.685 --> 00:59:10.590
<v Tony Wasserman:>use, because the ones that were the

1334
00:59:11.693 --> 00:59:13.356
<v Tony Wasserman:>most ready were the ones that already

1335
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.946
<v Tony Wasserman:>provided the same kind of customer support

1336
00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:22.015
<v Tony Wasserman:>and updates and roadmaps that companies and

1337
00:59:22.055 --> 00:59:25.105
<v Tony Wasserman:>businesses expected from commercial software.

1338
00:59:25.767 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Tony Wasserman:>So if you made your open source

1339
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.482
<v Tony Wasserman:>software business look like a commercial software

1340
00:59:30.502 --> 00:59:34.711
<v Tony Wasserman:>business, only here's the code too, you

1341
00:59:34.751 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Tony Wasserman:>had a much higher business readiness rating

1342
00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.447
<v Tony Wasserman:>score than if it was two graduate

1343
00:59:41.507 --> 00:59:45.615
<v Tony Wasserman:>students who were releasing new versions of

1344
00:59:45.655 --> 00:59:47.724
<v Tony Wasserman:>the software whenever it pleased them.

1345
00:59:48.005 --> 00:59:49.650
<v Tony Wasserman:>Coming in little mailers and shipping them

1346
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:50.453
<v Tony Wasserman:>out of their apartment or

1347
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.461
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>something, yeah.

1348
00:59:52.483 --> 00:59:52.984
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Exactly.

1349
00:59:53.425 --> 00:59:57.992
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>So the business readiness rating was a

1350
00:59:58.032 --> 01:00:00.616
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>good idea, but we didn't

1351
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.788
<v Tony Wasserman:>build automated tools to let you say,

1352
01:00:04.848 --> 01:00:08.355
<v Tony Wasserman:>here's this piece of software, go evaluate

1353
01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:11.145
<v Tony Wasserman:>it for, you can only evaluate part

1354
01:00:11.185 --> 01:00:13.410
<v Tony Wasserman:>of it because other things, you had

1355
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.055
<v Tony Wasserman:>to go, for example, look on Amazon

1356
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.482
<v Tony Wasserman:>and say, well, how many books are

1357
01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:20.710
<v Tony Wasserman:>written about this particular piece of software?

1358
01:00:21.813 --> 01:00:25.264
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oh, so what happened, first of all,

1359
01:00:25.304 --> 01:00:28.069
<v Tony Wasserman:>is that the guy who was the

1360
01:00:28.129 --> 01:00:32.416
<v Tony Wasserman:>main spike source contributor is Murugan Pal,

1361
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:35.666
<v Tony Wasserman:>and he got sick and he's no

1362
01:00:35.686 --> 01:00:36.287
<v Tony Wasserman:>longer with us.

1363
01:00:36.427 --> 01:00:39.792
<v Tony Wasserman:>He died maybe a decade ago.

1364
01:00:39.813 --> 01:00:45.547
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Nat from O'Reilly went home to

1365
01:00:45.607 --> 01:00:50.856
<v Tony Wasserman:>New Zealand, and Pete Cronenweth from Intel

1366
01:00:51.097 --> 01:00:52.902
<v Tony Wasserman:>had other things he wanted to do.

1367
01:00:53.323 --> 01:00:58.951
<v Tony Wasserman:>So it kind of disintegrated, and it

1368
01:00:59.131 --> 01:01:04.218
<v Tony Wasserman:>actually stayed moribund, if you will, for

1369
01:01:04.278 --> 01:01:04.539
<v Tony Wasserman:>a number of years.

1370
01:01:04.539 --> 01:01:04.609
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then maybe if you will, for

1371
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.649
<v Tony Wasserman:>a number of years.

1372
01:01:04.649 --> 01:01:04.924
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then maybe around 2012 or 13,

1373
01:01:04.924 --> 01:01:06.625
<v Tony Wasserman:>I said, well, this is a good

1374
01:01:06.645 --> 01:01:15.080
<v Tony Wasserman:>idea, so let's bring it back to

1375
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.883
<v Tony Wasserman:>life and let's fix some of the

1376
01:01:16.943 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Tony Wasserman:>things that we need to do.

1377
01:01:21.933 --> 01:01:23.154
<v Tony Wasserman:>So first of all, we gave the

1378
01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:24.881
<v Tony Wasserman:>new project a name, and the name

1379
01:01:24.902 --> 01:01:26.104
<v Tony Wasserman:>is OSS Pal.

1380
01:01:26.706 --> 01:01:30.093
<v Tony Wasserman:>And Pal is obviously a double entendre,

1381
01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:33.144
<v Tony Wasserman:>one as an acknowledgement to Murugan Pal

1382
01:01:33.525 --> 01:01:35.930
<v Tony Wasserman:>and the other, that it's your pal.

1383
01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:37.234
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, yep, yep.

1384
01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:38.741
<v Tony Wasserman:>It's your open source software.

1385
01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:39.582
<v Tony Wasserman:>So I love the name.

1386
01:01:40.104 --> 01:01:43.792
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the other thing we did in

1387
01:01:43.832 --> 01:01:46.903
<v Tony Wasserman:>the OSS Pal project, it was up

1388
01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:50.650
<v Tony Wasserman:>for many years on on OSSPal.org, but

1389
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.856
<v Tony Wasserman:>no longer is maintained, it's not there.

1390
01:01:56.685 --> 01:02:01.254
<v Tony Wasserman:>So instead, if you go out and

1391
01:02:01.294 --> 01:02:03.237
<v Tony Wasserman:>do a search for, let's say, content

1392
01:02:03.277 --> 01:02:06.879
<v Tony Wasserman:>management systems, or even management systems, or

1393
01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:09.495
<v Tony Wasserman:>even open source content management systems, you're

1394
01:02:09.515 --> 01:02:10.999
<v Tony Wasserman:>going to get some huge number of

1395
01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:11.319
<v Tony Wasserman:>hits.

1396
01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:13.108
<v Tony Wasserman:>So if I'm some huge number of

1397
01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:13.118
<v Tony Wasserman:>hits.

1398
01:02:13.118 --> 01:02:14.471
<v Tony Wasserman:>So if I'm in, if I'm some

1399
01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:16.415
<v Tony Wasserman:>engineer in some company, and I say,

1400
01:02:16.756 --> 01:02:18.098
<v Tony Wasserman:>well, I want to go try one

1401
01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:18.325
<v Tony Wasserman:>of these open one of these open

1402
01:02:18.946 --> 01:02:22.375
<v Tony Wasserman:>source content management systems, and you go

1403
01:02:22.395 --> 01:02:23.819
<v Tony Wasserman:>to your favorite search engine, and you

1404
01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:23.980
<v Tony Wasserman:>type you go to your favorite search

1405
01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:24.117
<v Tony Wasserman:>engine, and you type you go to

1406
01:02:24.117 --> 01:02:24.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>your favorite search engine, and you type

1407
01:02:24.187 --> 01:02:24.257
<v Tony Wasserman:>you go to your favorite search engine,

1408
01:02:24.257 --> 01:02:25.149
<v Tony Wasserman:>and you type in open source content

1409
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.489
<v Tony Wasserman:>management systems, you know, this wave.

1410
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:29.091
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yep.

1411
01:02:29.091 --> 01:02:34.165
<v Tony Wasserman:>Like 1400 of them.

1412
01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:36.569
<v Tony Wasserman:>I can only imagine.

1413
01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:36.888
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yep.

1414
01:02:37.551 --> 01:02:37.811
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

1415
01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:40.174
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we said, yeah, that's never

1416
01:02:40.195 --> 01:02:40.616
<v Tony Wasserman:>going to work.

1417
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:43.447
<v Tony Wasserman:>So what we decided to do with

1418
01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:45.672
<v Tony Wasserman:>OSSPal, and I think it's it's really

1419
01:02:45.713 --> 01:02:46.515
<v Tony Wasserman:>a sound idea.

1420
01:02:47.242 --> 01:02:49.048
<v Tony Wasserman:>And if I had the resources, we

1421
01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:50.313
<v Tony Wasserman:>bring it all back to life.

1422
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.750
<v Tony Wasserman:>As we curated, we said, look, you

1423
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.894
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, what we know from our previous

1424
01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:00.102
<v Tony Wasserman:>experiences, there's certain things that you need

1425
01:03:00.123 --> 01:03:02.950
<v Tony Wasserman:>to have in a project for it

1426
01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.975
<v Tony Wasserman:>to be suitable for business use.

1427
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:07.384
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we could go in there and

1428
01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:09.488
<v Tony Wasserman:>look at Drupal, for example, and say,

1429
01:03:09.509 --> 01:03:12.359
<v Tony Wasserman:>ah, okay, well, there's a company that

1430
01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.267
<v Tony Wasserman:>supports it, there's an ecosystem around it,

1431
01:03:15.307 --> 01:03:16.529
<v Tony Wasserman:>there's a big community.

1432
01:03:17.993 --> 01:03:19.821
<v Tony Wasserman:>It's been around for a while, there's

1433
01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:22.327
<v Tony Wasserman:>a roadmap, there are new releases, all

1434
01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:26.035
<v Tony Wasserman:>these things that make it attractive to

1435
01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:29.707
<v Tony Wasserman:>people who would be evaluating software.

1436
01:03:30.288 --> 01:03:33.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, you know, that makes the bar.

1437
01:03:33.794 --> 01:03:35.801
<v Tony Wasserman:>So what we would do was to

1438
01:03:36.002 --> 01:03:40.111
<v Tony Wasserman:>find candidates that people would want to

1439
01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:40.491
<v Tony Wasserman:>look at.

1440
01:03:40.852 --> 01:03:42.556
<v Tony Wasserman:>So rather than our saying to you,

1441
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.749
<v Tony Wasserman:>use this content management system, we use

1442
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:48.743
<v Tony Wasserman:>this database management system, we would say,

1443
01:03:48.763 --> 01:03:52.212
<v Tony Wasserman:>here are three or five candidates that

1444
01:03:52.232 --> 01:03:53.555
<v Tony Wasserman:>we think you should look at.

1445
01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:58.288
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then they could put weights for

1446
01:03:58.308 --> 01:04:00.191
<v Tony Wasserman:>the different criteria.

1447
01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:02.694
<v Tony Wasserman:>Some of those criteria were based on

1448
01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:05.786
<v Tony Wasserman:>the domain in which the software works.

1449
01:04:05.906 --> 01:04:09.094
<v Tony Wasserman:>So you ask different things in evaluating

1450
01:04:09.134 --> 01:04:11.186
<v Tony Wasserman:>a database management system than you do

1451
01:04:11.246 --> 01:04:13.153
<v Tony Wasserman:>in evaluating a content management system.

1452
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>Does this take you back at all

1453
01:04:16.247 --> 01:04:18.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>to that dissertation project about, you know?

1454
01:04:19.281 --> 01:04:19.925
<v Tony Wasserman:>Not really, no.

1455
01:04:21.723 --> 01:04:25.589
<v Tony Wasserman:>No, but here are these criteria that

1456
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:26.432
<v Tony Wasserman:>you're going to use.

1457
01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:28.215
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so we would pick several of

1458
01:04:28.255 --> 01:04:28.355
<v Tony Wasserman:>them.

1459
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.346
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we worked with IDC, the analyst

1460
01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:33.787
<v Tony Wasserman:>company.

1461
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:39.076
<v Tony Wasserman:>And IDC, it turns out, every year

1462
01:04:39.156 --> 01:04:41.102
<v Tony Wasserman:>publishes a software taxonomy.

1463
01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:44.890
<v Tony Wasserman:>And their software taxonomy breaks all of

1464
01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:46.754
<v Tony Wasserman:>software into categories.

1465
01:04:47.235 --> 01:04:50.605
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there are about 80 categories that

1466
01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:51.687
<v Tony Wasserman:>they identify.

1467
01:04:54.873 --> 01:04:56.395
<v Tony Wasserman:>Was it a perfect fit for open

1468
01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:56.856
<v Tony Wasserman:>source?

1469
01:04:58.383 --> 01:05:00.808
<v Tony Wasserman:>Not entirely, because a lot of the

1470
01:05:00.889 --> 01:05:02.933
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source projects that were most widely

1471
01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:08.308
<v Tony Wasserman:>used were developer tools and infrastructure, much

1472
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.353
<v Tony Wasserman:>less the application side.

1473
01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.761
<v Tony Wasserman:>But it was a good starting point.

1474
01:05:12.822 --> 01:05:17.592
<v Tony Wasserman:>And we tried adding some additional application

1475
01:05:17.632 --> 01:05:19.941
<v Tony Wasserman:>domains so we could divide up development

1476
01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:20.883
<v Tony Wasserman:>tools, for example.

1477
01:05:22.046 --> 01:05:23.468
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we went ahead with that.

1478
01:05:23.769 --> 01:05:27.440
<v Tony Wasserman:>And the idea was, okay, we're going

1479
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.422
<v Tony Wasserman:>to do the curation.

1480
01:05:28.502 --> 01:05:32.670
<v Tony Wasserman:>Now what we want is we get

1481
01:05:32.691 --> 01:05:35.356
<v Tony Wasserman:>these evaluations partly on the basis of

1482
01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:40.851
<v Tony Wasserman:>the domain, and partly in general, right?

1483
01:05:40.911 --> 01:05:42.515
<v Tony Wasserman:>How much documentation is there?

1484
01:05:42.615 --> 01:05:45.948
<v Tony Wasserman:>Is there the kind of generic things

1485
01:05:45.989 --> 01:05:47.312
<v Tony Wasserman:>that you might ask about any piece

1486
01:05:47.352 --> 01:05:47.914
<v Tony Wasserman:>of software?

1487
01:05:49.462 --> 01:05:53.748
<v Tony Wasserman:>So the idea then was that people

1488
01:05:53.788 --> 01:05:55.650
<v Tony Wasserman:>would write reviews.

1489
01:05:55.670 --> 01:06:00.621
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay, so I've used Mozilla Firefox, okay?

1490
01:06:00.701 --> 01:06:03.346
<v Tony Wasserman:>And here's how I would evaluate it.

1491
01:06:03.648 --> 01:06:04.911
<v Tony Wasserman:>The same way you would evaluate a

1492
01:06:04.951 --> 01:06:06.941
<v Tony Wasserman:>movie or a restaurant or much of

1493
01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:08.907
<v Tony Wasserman:>anything else, give it, you know, a

1494
01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:10.725
<v Tony Wasserman:>bunch of check marks or scores, 05

1495
01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:14.685
<v Tony Wasserman:>in these different categories, and then free

1496
01:06:14.726 --> 01:06:15.107
<v Tony Wasserman:>text.

1497
01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:20.154
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, we had the same

1498
01:06:20.215 --> 01:06:23.723
<v Tony Wasserman:>issue that all online surveys have, which

1499
01:06:23.844 --> 01:06:26.288
<v Tony Wasserman:>is that, how do you know that

1500
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:31.716
<v Tony Wasserman:>the person who's writing the review is

1501
01:06:33.103 --> 01:06:34.225
<v Tony Wasserman:>being accurate about it?

1502
01:06:34.246 --> 01:06:36.591
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1503
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:37.734
<v Tony Wasserman:>There's not much you can do about

1504
01:06:37.754 --> 01:06:39.746
<v Tony Wasserman:>that, other than asking people to register

1505
01:06:39.866 --> 01:06:42.073
<v Tony Wasserman:>and get their email address and verify

1506
01:06:42.133 --> 01:06:42.173
<v Tony Wasserman:>it.

1507
01:06:44.564 --> 01:06:46.428
<v Tony Wasserman:>But we really didn't have the resources

1508
01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:50.296
<v Tony Wasserman:>to do the kind of awareness generation,

1509
01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:55.228
<v Tony Wasserman:>not to say marketing, that it would

1510
01:06:55.268 --> 01:06:57.291
<v Tony Wasserman:>take to bring a lot of people

1511
01:06:57.411 --> 01:06:59.815
<v Tony Wasserman:>in to write these reviews.

1512
01:07:00.256 --> 01:07:02.665
<v Tony Wasserman:>So we concluded that it was a

1513
01:07:02.725 --> 01:07:04.951
<v Tony Wasserman:>great idea, and that if we were

1514
01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:06.755
<v Tony Wasserman:>doing it as a commercial venture and

1515
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.446
<v Tony Wasserman:>could raise venture capital to build it,

1516
01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:13.872
<v Tony Wasserman:>it would be valuable.

1517
01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:18.283
<v Tony Wasserman:>What's happened in the meantime is, of

1518
01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:23.172
<v Tony Wasserman:>course, the STARS mechanism that exists on

1519
01:07:23.212 --> 01:07:23.652
<v Tony Wasserman:>GitHub.

1520
01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:26.322
<v Tony Wasserman:>There's always been, or at least there's

1521
01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:28.648
<v Tony Wasserman:>been for a long time, OpenHub, which

1522
01:07:28.749 --> 01:07:30.779
<v Tony Wasserman:>lets you look at the source code,

1523
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.743
<v Tony Wasserman:>and the contributions, and the dates, and

1524
01:07:33.185 --> 01:07:37.494
<v Tony Wasserman:>the, let's say, the aliveness of a

1525
01:07:37.534 --> 01:07:38.621
<v Tony Wasserman:>particular project.

1526
01:07:39.643 --> 01:07:41.186
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there's some other things that are

1527
01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:45.394
<v Tony Wasserman:>out there that play a valuable role

1528
01:07:45.894 --> 01:07:48.865
<v Tony Wasserman:>in terms of helping people evaluate open

1529
01:07:48.885 --> 01:07:49.647
<v Tony Wasserman:>source software.

1530
01:07:50.028 --> 01:07:51.873
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, of course, more and more with

1531
01:07:51.933 --> 01:07:59.130
<v Tony Wasserman:>commercial open source, you have salespeople.

1532
01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:02.134
<v Tony Wasserman:>And you have conferences like the Open

1533
01:08:02.155 --> 01:08:04.544
<v Tony Wasserman:>Source Summit that the Linux Foundation puts

1534
01:08:04.724 --> 01:08:06.629
<v Tony Wasserman:>on several times a year around the

1535
01:08:06.669 --> 01:08:09.080
<v Tony Wasserman:>world, and those have exhibit booths.

1536
01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:12.226
<v Tony Wasserman:>And so that's an opportunity for these

1537
01:08:12.266 --> 01:08:18.416
<v Tony Wasserman:>commercial businesses to tell the world about

1538
01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.081
<v Tony Wasserman:>their products.

1539
01:08:20.944 --> 01:08:23.149
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, the final question I wanted to

1540
01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.614
<v Tony Wasserman:>ask you was about what you see

1541
01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:25.675
<v Tony Wasserman:>as

1542
01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:31.450
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>the biggest challenges for open source as

1543
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:33.934
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>an idea, or for open source as

1544
01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:35.983
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>a movement, or even as a set

1545
01:08:36.023 --> 01:08:38.509
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of practices in the future.

1546
01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:39.973
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Now and in the future, what you

1547
01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:42.705
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>see is the largest potential impediments to

1548
01:08:42.745 --> 01:08:44.490
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>its proliferation or growth.

1549
01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:46.101
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And I wonder if that's, is that

1550
01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.229
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>one of them, curation, you see as

1551
01:08:48.408 --> 01:08:49.453
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>a challenge or an issue?

1552
01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.425
<v Tony Wasserman:>Well, there are a lot of issues,

1553
01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:51.926
<v Tony Wasserman:>of course.

1554
01:08:52.267 --> 01:08:54.974
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, answering this would depend

1555
01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:56.161
<v Tony Wasserman:>on how much time we have.

1556
01:08:58.865 --> 01:09:01.589
<v Tony Wasserman:>But the first part of it is

1557
01:09:01.769 --> 01:09:04.774
<v Tony Wasserman:>that proprietary software isn't going away.

1558
01:09:04.794 --> 01:09:08.243
<v Tony Wasserman:>Okay, that, you know, there are these

1559
01:09:08.384 --> 01:09:10.269
<v Tony Wasserman:>pipe dreams that some people have had

1560
01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:12.540
<v Tony Wasserman:>about, you know, the world going to

1561
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.281
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source.

1562
01:09:13.702 --> 01:09:16.287
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, I simply don't see

1563
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:22.024
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oracle giving away their source code, or

1564
01:09:22.104 --> 01:09:24.849
<v Tony Wasserman:>other companies with such a major investment.

1565
01:09:25.111 --> 01:09:26.474
<v Tony Wasserman:>Now, Microsoft did a bit of that

1566
01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:29.844
<v Tony Wasserman:>when they did Visual Studio Code, above

1567
01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:32.388
<v Tony Wasserman:>what was in Visual Studio Pro, I

1568
01:09:33.871 --> 01:09:36.576
<v Tony Wasserman:>think, and made that freely available.

1569
01:09:36.616 --> 01:09:38.163
<v Tony Wasserman:>And there's some other examples of it.

1570
01:09:38.743 --> 01:09:42.213
<v Tony Wasserman:>But I think open source and proprietary

1571
01:09:42.353 --> 01:09:43.741
<v Tony Wasserman:>software are going to to coexist.

1572
01:09:44.341 --> 01:09:46.205
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I think that over time, as

1573
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:51.314
<v Tony Wasserman:>more people come into the industry, they're

1574
01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:54.985
<v Tony Wasserman:>going to do their evaluations based on

1575
01:09:55.085 --> 01:10:00.133
<v Tony Wasserman:>functionality of the product, rather than, oh,

1576
01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:03.563
<v Tony Wasserman:>it's open, or it's closed, or here's

1577
01:10:03.603 --> 01:10:04.566
<v Tony Wasserman:>how much it costs.

1578
01:10:04.586 --> 01:10:07.532
<v Tony Wasserman:>I mean, that those become factors in

1579
01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:08.781
<v Tony Wasserman:>doing evaluation.

1580
01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:13.870
<v Tony Wasserman:>Another thing is that open source has

1581
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:16.515
<v Tony Wasserman:>not been very strong, for example, in

1582
01:10:16.555 --> 01:10:16.876
<v Tony Wasserman:>mobile.

1583
01:10:18.122 --> 01:10:19.725
<v Tony Wasserman:>So when you start to look at

1584
01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:22.210
<v Tony Wasserman:>all the applications that have been developed

1585
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:27.023
<v Tony Wasserman:>for mobile devices, you you know, you

1586
01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:31.570
<v Tony Wasserman:>put the F Droid library, which is

1587
01:10:31.651 --> 01:10:34.715
<v Tony Wasserman:>the Android mobile app, you put that

1588
01:10:34.776 --> 01:10:36.362
<v Tony Wasserman:>up against Google's Play Store.

1589
01:10:36.722 --> 01:10:37.544
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it's a joke.

1590
01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:38.505
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah, right.

1591
01:10:38.586 --> 01:10:38.806
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

1592
01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:45.402
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and Apple, in their store, you

1593
01:10:45.883 --> 01:10:48.250
<v Tony Wasserman:>know, makes it very difficult to get

1594
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:49.674
<v Tony Wasserman:>open source software in there.

1595
01:10:50.782 --> 01:10:52.847
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there's not, there's not much of

1596
01:10:52.927 --> 01:10:53.288
<v Tony Wasserman:>it there.

1597
01:10:53.769 --> 01:10:58.224
<v Tony Wasserman:>So there are some definite challenges to

1598
01:10:58.264 --> 01:10:58.525
<v Tony Wasserman:>that.

1599
01:10:58.806 --> 01:11:00.932
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, there's still this educational

1600
01:11:00.992 --> 01:11:03.523
<v Tony Wasserman:>process of how do you make money

1601
01:11:03.584 --> 01:11:04.365
<v Tony Wasserman:>at open source.

1602
01:11:06.069 --> 01:11:08.354
<v Tony Wasserman:>And now I teach open source software,

1603
01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:10.223
<v Tony Wasserman:>I've taught it, you know, 17 times

1604
01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:11.907
<v Tony Wasserman:>or something at Carnegie Mellon.

1605
01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:13.373
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it's evolved over the years, of

1606
01:11:13.453 --> 01:11:17.007
<v Tony Wasserman:>course, has brought guests in to share

1607
01:11:17.068 --> 01:11:18.792
<v Tony Wasserman:>their experience and knowledge.

1608
01:11:18.812 --> 01:11:25.007
<v Tony Wasserman:>But you know, there's still people who

1609
01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:28.354
<v Tony Wasserman:>don't believe, yeah, why would you write

1610
01:11:28.394 --> 01:11:29.155
<v Tony Wasserman:>software for free?

1611
01:11:29.861 --> 01:11:30.022
<v Tony Wasserman:>Yeah.

1612
01:11:30.142 --> 01:11:31.967
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, and my answer to them is,

1613
01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:34.052
<v Tony Wasserman:>well, why would you go volunteer your

1614
01:11:34.092 --> 01:11:35.801
<v Tony Wasserman:>time at the hospital to help six

1615
01:11:35.861 --> 01:11:36.743
<v Tony Wasserman:>people, sick people?

1616
01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:39.629
<v Tony Wasserman:>Why would you go to a place

1617
01:11:39.689 --> 01:11:43.360
<v Tony Wasserman:>where there's been a natural disaster and

1618
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.624
<v Tony Wasserman:>do your best to help out?

1619
01:11:45.386 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Tony Wasserman:>These are, you know, things that people

1620
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.962
<v Tony Wasserman:>do, because it gives them personal fulfillment.

1621
01:11:51.406 --> 01:11:54.592
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so I think that there are

1622
01:11:54.652 --> 01:11:57.526
<v Tony Wasserman:>good answers to the question of why

1623
01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:58.731
<v Tony Wasserman:>do people do this for free?

1624
01:12:00.945 --> 01:12:02.589
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Is that is that is the future

1625
01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.095
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>of open source beholden to people's altruism?

1626
01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:08.028
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Like, is, is the limit of open

1627
01:12:08.068 --> 01:12:09.673
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>source, the limit of people's altruism, do

1628
01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:09.914
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>you think?

1629
01:12:11.242 --> 01:12:11.823
<v Tony Wasserman:>I don't know.

1630
01:12:11.843 --> 01:12:15.831
<v Tony Wasserman:>You know, it's, it's, you know, if

1631
01:12:15.912 --> 01:12:17.353
<v Tony Wasserman:>I were able to predict the future

1632
01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:19.764
<v Tony Wasserman:>that well, then I would be, I

1633
01:12:19.804 --> 01:12:20.867
<v Tony Wasserman:>would be very wealthy.

1634
01:12:21.408 --> 01:12:22.932
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I would be, I would be

1635
01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.902
<v Tony Wasserman:>like rich, Richard Branson on my own

1636
01:12:25.064 --> 01:12:25.346
<v Tony Wasserman:>island.

1637
01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.766
<v Tony Wasserman:>We probably wouldn't have been working for

1638
01:12:27.786 --> 01:12:29.572
<v Tony Wasserman:>so many failed startups, I guess, if

1639
01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:29.853
<v Tony Wasserman:>you could.

1640
01:12:29.853 --> 01:12:32.645
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>You You know, startups fail.

1641
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:37.534
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>I, you know, I taught startup creation

1642
01:12:37.594 --> 01:12:38.316
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>kinds of things

1643
01:12:39.002 --> 01:12:39.964
<v Tony Wasserman:>at Carnegie Mellon.

1644
01:12:40.025 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Tony Wasserman:>And every now and then one of

1645
01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:45.625
<v Tony Wasserman:>the companies goes beyond the campus and

1646
01:12:45.705 --> 01:12:46.807
<v Tony Wasserman:>starts their own business.

1647
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:49.253
<v Tony Wasserman:>But it's, there are a lot of

1648
01:12:49.293 --> 01:12:50.355
<v Tony Wasserman:>barriers to success.

1649
01:12:52.183 --> 01:12:53.486
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it's not until you're out there

1650
01:12:53.546 --> 01:12:53.967
<v Tony Wasserman:>doing it.

1651
01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:58.175
<v Tony Wasserman:>I work these days with Berkeley's accelerator

1652
01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.141
<v Tony Wasserman:>called Skydeck.

1653
01:12:59.822 --> 01:13:02.166
<v Tony Wasserman:>And they, they had like 1000 applicants

1654
01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:03.389
<v Tony Wasserman:>for 18 places, or, you know, some

1655
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.868
<v Tony Wasserman:>key, wildly selective thing.

1656
01:13:11.309 --> 01:13:12.912
<v Tony Wasserman:>And then, and then we meet these

1657
01:13:12.992 --> 01:13:13.573
<v Tony Wasserman:>companies.

1658
01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:15.581
<v Tony Wasserman:>And, you know, a few of them

1659
01:13:16.784 --> 01:13:18.206
<v Tony Wasserman:>make it, right?

1660
01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.453
<v Tony Wasserman:>Because everything falls into place at the

1661
01:13:21.493 --> 01:13:22.074
<v Tony Wasserman:>right time.

1662
01:13:22.495 --> 01:13:24.423
<v Tony Wasserman:>But most of them, most of them

1663
01:13:24.463 --> 01:13:24.844
<v Tony Wasserman:>struggle.

1664
01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:26.187
<v Tony Wasserman:>And that's true of startups.

1665
01:13:27.109 --> 01:13:29.875
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it's been true as long as

1666
01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:30.987
<v Tony Wasserman:>the field has existed.

1667
01:13:31.642 --> 01:13:32.406
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Mm hmm.

1668
01:13:32.828 --> 01:13:33.028
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

1669
01:13:33.571 --> 01:13:33.731
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Yeah.

1670
01:13:35.443 --> 01:13:38.189
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Well, this has been a wonderful way

1671
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:39.411
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>to spend an afternoon.

1672
01:13:39.472 --> 01:13:41.295
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And I really appreciate your time.

1673

<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>Thanks for sharing your memories.

1675
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:47.041
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And, and, you know, this, this, as

1676
01:13:47.081 --> 01:13:48.766
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>we construct this great kind of oral

1677
01:13:48.806 --> 01:13:50.310
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>history of open source.

1678
01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:51.954
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>It's just been wonderful.

1679
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:52.926
<v Bryan Berhenshausen:>And I'm very grateful.

1680
01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.406
<v Tony Wasserman:>Oh, it's been it's been my pleasure.

1681
01:13:55.526 --> 01:13:57.711
<v Tony Wasserman:>And it forced me to recollect some

1682
01:13:57.731 --> 01:13:59.622
<v Tony Wasserman:>of these things and to dig some

1683
01:13:59.662 --> 01:14:01.569
<v Tony Wasserman:>of these names out of the far

1684
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:02.773
<v Tony Wasserman:>reaches of my memory.

1685
01:14:04.464 --> 01:14:06.929
<v Tony Wasserman:>It's definitely good to have it down

1686
01:14:06.949 --> 01:14:07.210
<v Tony Wasserman:>there.

1687
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:11.264
<v Tony Wasserman:>And I'll want to see the the

1688
01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:13.290
<v Tony Wasserman:>final version of it and, and perhaps

1689
01:14:14.011 --> 01:14:15.235
<v Tony Wasserman:>post on my LinkedIn.

1690
01:14:16.346 --> 01:14:16.687
<v Tony Wasserman:>Great.

1691
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:19.324
<v Tony Wasserman:>Where, where this is all gone.

1692
01:14:19.344 --> 01:14:21.448
<v Tony Wasserman:>So, so that's great.
