18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.785
<v Kirk McKusick>Welcome, Kirk, and thank you for

19
00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:12.568
<v Kirk McKusick>being here today.

20
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:14.582
<v Elisabetta Mori>Thank you.

21
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.071
<v Kirk McKusick>Okay, so let's start with where
and when were you born?

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.471
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was born in Wilmington,
Delaware, Delaware on the east

23
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>coast of the United States, and I
grew up in Wilmington.

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.152
<v Elisabetta Mori>My father was an executive for the
DuPont Company.

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.183
<v Elisabetta Mori>He started in the central research
department and then moved over

26
00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:52.625
<v Elisabetta Mori>into agricultural chemicals and
finished his career in the

27
00:01:55.271 --> 00:02:00.649
<v Elisabetta Mori>division that tested chemicals to
verify that they wouldn't have bad

28
00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>effects on the environment or on
people, which was something that

29
00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:09.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>you would take for granted today,
but 40 years ago when he was in

30
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.071
<v Elisabetta Mori>that department, it was a new idea
that was being promoted by the

31
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:19.227
<v Elisabetta Mori>DuPont Company and would
ultimately become something, of

32
00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:22.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>course, that became industry and
countrywide.

33
00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:26.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>My mother was a pediatrician.

34
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.346
<v Elisabetta Mori>She was in the first class at

35
00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:35.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>Harvard University that admitted
women to the medical school.

36
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:43.644
<v Elisabetta Mori>She and two other women were in
that initial class, and she came

37
00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:50.647
<v Elisabetta Mori>to Wilmington because that's where
my father was working, and the

38
00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:53.943
<v Elisabetta Mori>normal thing that you would do
when you were a new doctor is you

39
00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:58.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>would get associated with some
other doctor, and they would bring

40
00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:03.687
<v Elisabetta Mori>them in, and you could start to
build up a practice, but none of

41
00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:06.742
<v Elisabetta Mori>the male doctors that were
pediatricians in Wilmington seemed

42
00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:10.111
<v Elisabetta Mori>in Wilmington seemed particularly
interested in having her be part

43
00:03:10.131 --> 00:03:14.027
<v Elisabetta Mori>of their office, and so she
decided that she would just,

44
00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:22.381
<v Elisabetta Mori>quote, hang her shingle out and
start just accepting patients, and

45
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.721
<v Elisabetta Mori>that, of course, financially
wouldn't normally work out, but

46
00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:30.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>since my father had a significant
income, she was able to do this,

47
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:38.484
<v Elisabetta Mori>and in particular, she was willing
to take black patients, which the

48
00:03:38.564 --> 00:03:42.702
<v Elisabetta Mori>other doctors were a little bit
hesitant about, and so they would,

49
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>for example, say, well, black
patients could come on Thursdays

50
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>because that way the white
patients, if they didn't feel

51
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.582
<v Elisabetta Mori>comfortable being in the same
office with black patients, could

52
00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:57.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>just avoid making appointments on
Thursdays, and, of course, if they

53
00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.903
<v Elisabetta Mori>needed an appointment some other
day of the week and they were

54
00:03:59.943 --> 00:04:05.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>black, well, that was just too bad
for them, so it became well known

55
00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>in the black community that that
my mother was willing to take

56
00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:11.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>black patients, and before very
long, she had about 2,000

57
00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:22.368
<v Elisabetta Mori>patients, and because of this,
ended up living in a house that

58
00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:26.725
<v Elisabetta Mori>was right literally across the
street from where the black

59
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:30.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>community started, and we needed
to do this because many of her

60
00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:32.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>patients didn't own automobiles.

61
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:35.911
<v Elisabetta Mori>They had to use public transit or

62
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:41.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>walk, and so we needed to have an
office that was near to where they

63
00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:46.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>lived, and because of this,
although my parents were very

64
00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:52.908
<v Elisabetta Mori>strong believers in public
education, the public schools that

65
00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:57.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>we would have gone to were dire
because they would have been the

66
00:04:57.886 --> 00:05:05.593
<v Elisabetta Mori>schools that were in the inner
city and in those days, the inner

67
00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:08.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>city schools, since since they
largely served the black

68
00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:12.228
<v Elisabetta Mori>community, did not have the
funding and resources that the

69
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.491
<v Elisabetta Mori>schools in the suburbs had, so the
one concession they made was that

70
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:25.421
<v Elisabetta Mori>they decided that we really should
go to a private school, but there

71
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:28.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>were three private schools that
you could attend in Wilmington,

72
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:37.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>two of them were for the super
elite white families that had huge

73
00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:42.272
<v Elisabetta Mori>amounts of money, and they had an
attitude that my parents couldn't

74
00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:49.246
<v Elisabetta Mori>abide by, but the third was the
one run by the Quakers, Wilmington

75
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:55.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>Friends School, and so they felt
that this would be the appropriate

76
00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:59.531
<v Elisabetta Mori>compromise because the Wilmington
Friends School actually had, for

77
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:07.783
<v Elisabetta Mori>example, black students and other
lower income folks there, and so

78
00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:14.002
<v Elisabetta Mori>in fact, I ended up doing my
entire growing up, I started in

79
00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:18.562
<v Elisabetta Mori>kindergarten and I went all the
way through high school at

80
00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:30.295
<v Elisabetta Mori>Wilmington Friends School, and it
was certainly very beneficial to

81
00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:34.642
<v Elisabetta Mori>my growing up to be able to be,
first of all, in this school where

82
00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:38.285
<v Elisabetta Mori>you had everything from
kindergarten students to high

83
00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:41.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>school students all in the same
building and you had all these

84
00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:47.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>different people that you could
look up to, and the other thing

85
00:06:47.086 --> 00:06:51.963
<v Elisabetta Mori>was that the Quakers had sort of a
philosophy, although I'm not, I

86
00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:55.886
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't consider myself a Quaker,
they had a philosophy that

87
00:06:56.207 --> 00:07:03.814
<v Elisabetta Mori>resonated with me, and for
example, during the anti-war

88
00:07:03.874 --> 00:07:08.383
<v Elisabetta Mori>demonstrations, the anti-Vietnam
War demonstrations, they organized

89
00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:15.704
<v Elisabetta Mori>buses that would take us to
protests in Washington, D.C., and

90
00:07:16.045 --> 00:07:19.623
<v Elisabetta Mori>your parents had to sign off
saying that you could go, and then

91
00:07:19.663 --> 00:07:23.028
<v Elisabetta Mori>they also had to check a box
whether or not you were allowed to

92
00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>be in a situation that would allow
you to be arrested or not.

93
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>My parents wouldn't let me do the
thing where they actually arrested

94
00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:31.094
<v Elisabetta Mori>you.

95
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>They said, no, no, we're not

96
00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:34.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>letting you do that, but do that,
but you can go and you can

97
00:07:34.628 --> 00:07:36.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>protest, but when they tell you
you have to leave, you have to

98
00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:37.167
<v Elisabetta Mori>leave.

99
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.371
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the other thing that is kind

100
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:48.031
<v Elisabetta Mori>of amusing is that Joe Biden, of
course, started his political

101
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:56.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>career as a senator from Delaware,
and I actually worked on his

102
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.887
<v Elisabetta Mori>campaign for his very first
campaign for public office.

103
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.332
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I have a little tiny, I've
actually met him and talked to

104
00:08:07.352 --> 00:08:07.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>him.

105
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>I'm sure he would have no memory

106
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.948
<v Elisabetta Mori>of me today because that was a
very, very long time ago.

107
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:18.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>Another one of the little stories
that came out of Wilmington

108
00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:25.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>Friends School was that I, at a
very early age, realized that I

109
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:32.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>was attracted to men, and I was
told, well, boys like other boys,

110
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:37.011
<v Elisabetta Mori>and then you grow up and you start
liking girls.

111
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>But no one really said, well, when
that transition was supposed to

112
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:40.692
<v Elisabetta Mori>happen.

113
00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:44.491
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, I got to about 16 before I

114
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Elisabetta Mori>realized, I just don't think that
transition is going to happen for

115
00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:48.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>me.

116
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:53.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>But at any rate, at one point,

117
00:08:55.412 --> 00:08:59.666
<v Elisabetta Mori>probably in maybe fifth grade or
something, one of the other

118
00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>students made some kind of
derogatory comment to me.

119
00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:08.769
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't even quite remember what
the comment was, but I don't think

120
00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:12.405
<v Elisabetta Mori>it was as strong as something like
faggot, but it was something

121
00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:17.316
<v Elisabetta Mori>demeaning the fact that I appeared
to be too interested in boys.

122
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one of the teachers just came
down on this person like a ton of

123
00:09:21.653 --> 00:09:21.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>bricks.

124
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.066
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like, it is not for you to

125
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:32.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>lay these sorts of judgments on
other people.

126
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:34.444
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was it.

127
00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Elisabetta Mori>That was like the one negative

128
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.294
<v Elisabetta Mori>comment I ever got.

129
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the teacher just came down on

130
00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:41.372
<v Elisabetta Mori>this person like a ton of bricks,
and that was it.

131
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.983
<v Elisabetta Mori>After that, it was like, fine.

132
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that was in an environment.

133
00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:55.855
<v Elisabetta Mori>In the 1960s, things like gay
rights were not, they were still

134
00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:56.356
<v Elisabetta Mori>in the future.

135
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:58.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>We hadn't had Stonewall yet or any

136
00:09:58.128 --> 00:09:58.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>of those other things.

137
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.365
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, to have that attitude by

138
00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:11.945
<v Elisabetta Mori>teachers was just a thing that was
important and was unlikely to have

139
00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:14.312
<v Elisabetta Mori>been seen in other school
situations.

140
00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:18.931
<v Kirk McKusick>Can you briefly describe your
siblings?

141
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:21.143
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

142
00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:22.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was the oldest of three

143
00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:23.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>children.

144
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:27.469
<v Elisabetta Mori>I have a brother that's two years

145
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>younger than I am and a sister who
is five years younger than I am.

146
00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:43.721
<v Elisabetta Mori>My brother ended up going and
getting his PhD in English and

147
00:10:43.781 --> 00:10:48.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>became an English professor
initially at the University of

148
00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:50.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>Maryland, Baltimore campus.

149
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:56.429
<v Elisabetta Mori>He then started to become

150
00:10:56.469 --> 00:11:00.996
<v Elisabetta Mori>interested in moving up more into
the administrative levels.

151
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:06.094
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the people that were above him
there were close enough to his age

152
00:11:06.221 --> 00:11:07.929
<v Elisabetta Mori>that there wasn't going to be a
lot of turnover.

153
00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:14.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, he ended up moving to the
University of Montana in Missoula

154
00:11:15.323 --> 00:11:19.315
<v Elisabetta Mori>where he became the dean of their
honors college.

155
00:11:24.186 --> 00:11:28.194
<v Elisabetta Mori>The honors college, for the most
part, didn't take their own

156
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:28.975
<v Elisabetta Mori>professors.

157
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:32.247
<v Elisabetta Mori>They mostly would take professors

158
00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:35.674
<v Elisabetta Mori>from other departments.

159
00:11:36.642 --> 00:11:38.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the professors would be

160
00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:40.743
<v Elisabetta Mori>professors of these other
departments, but they would teach

161
00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:41.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>honors classes.

162
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.413
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, you know, he was quite happy

163
00:11:49.453 --> 00:11:49.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>there.

164
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>But he then got an opportunity to,

165
00:11:55.107 --> 00:12:01.260
<v Elisabetta Mori>or he got invited to apply to
start an honors college at the

166
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.593
<v Elisabetta Mori>University of Missouri in Kansas
City.

167
00:12:06.481 --> 00:12:10.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they were going to build a
building and have staff and all of

168
00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:11.413
<v Elisabetta Mori>these things.

169
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.171
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was a considerable step

170
00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:16.673
<v Elisabetta Mori>up for him.

171
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.728
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, he chose to do that.

172
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:25.625
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, then he moved to Kansas City,
Missouri, and finished his career

173
00:12:28.532 --> 00:12:30.536
<v Elisabetta Mori>organizing and running that honors
college.

174
00:12:30.943 --> 00:12:32.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, just last year, he
retired.

175
00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:38.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>My sister, meanwhile, started out.

176
00:12:39.243 --> 00:12:41.209
<v Elisabetta Mori>She got her undergraduate degree

177
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:47.593
<v Elisabetta Mori>in biology and then went on and
did a master's degree in computer

178
00:12:47.613 --> 00:12:48.014
<v Elisabetta Mori>science.

179
00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:51.024
<v Elisabetta Mori>And she initially started out

180
00:12:51.945 --> 00:13:00.376
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually teaching biology in high
school in Nashville, Tennessee.

181
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:08.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>But that, you know, she didn't
find that all that rewarding.

182
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.209
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, she actually got an
opportunity to work at a startup

183
00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:22.377
<v Elisabetta Mori>company that was developing drugs.

184
00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:25.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, actually, no. Back up.

185
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.489
<v Elisabetta Mori>She started, she got an
opportunity to work on the human

186
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.935
<v Elisabetta Mori>genome project at Stanford
University.

187
00:13:33.763 --> 00:13:41.182
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there, she could use both of
her skill sets because she

188
00:13:41.282 --> 00:13:45.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>understood the biology side of
what they needed to do in order to

189
00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:47.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>sequence the genes.

190
00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:49.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>There was this huge amount of data

191
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>coming in, and she understood the
computer science side where she

192
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>understood, essentially, how to
structure a database to put that

193
00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:01.707
<v Elisabetta Mori>data in and be able to answer the
kinds of questions that the

194
00:14:01.767 --> 00:14:03.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>biologists wanted to ask about it.

195
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:06.045
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, it's fine, you have a big

196
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:09.435
<v Elisabetta Mori>pile of data, but you need to be
able to ask questions about it,

197
00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:12.307
<v Elisabetta Mori>and about it, and you have to have
that data structured in such a way

198
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:15.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>that you can retrieve based on
what the question is.

199
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:22.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, she ended up using both her
computer science and her biology.

200
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:28.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it was from that that that
project, of course, wound up.

201
00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>But one of the people that she had
worked with there had done a

202
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.356
<v Elisabetta Mori>startup company doing drug
development.

203
00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:40.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he brought her in to have the
same sort of role at that company,

204
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>where she would both organize the
collection of data from the

205
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.856
<v Elisabetta Mori>scientists and the storage and
retrieval of that data.

206
00:14:49.783 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that became her sweet spot.

207
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:54.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>And she loved startup companies,

208
00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:58.173
<v Elisabetta Mori>but when they would get to the
point where they were sort of two

209
00:14:58.213 --> 00:15:00.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>levels of management, so more than
about 150 people, that was it.

210
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>She was done with it because there
was too much hoofer on politics

211
00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:06.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>that she didn't like.

212
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, about every five to seven

213
00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.694
<v Elisabetta Mori>years, she would jump ship and get
to another one of these startups,

214
00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:16.273
<v Elisabetta Mori>where she could again have this
role.

215
00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:20.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, she did that on at least three
different occasions.

216
00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:21.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>Maybe it was four.

217
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.186
<v Elisabetta Mori>And anyway, that sort of thing

218
00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:29.715
<v Elisabetta Mori>finished up for her about a year
ago.

219
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:34.209
<v Elisabetta Mori>And although she's a couple of
years from being 65, official

220
00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:42.089
<v Elisabetta Mori>retirement age, she's decided to
take some time off because she

221
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>doesn't really want to start
another seven years at this point.

222
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it looks like it's going to
stick.

223
00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:51.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>And she's now in Redwood City.

224
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, she's just a 45-minute drive

225
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:55.672
<v Elisabetta Mori>from here.

226
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.085
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I actually get to see her a

227
00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:57.547
<v Elisabetta Mori>fair amount.

228
00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:00.868
<v Elisabetta Mori>My brother and his wife did not

229
00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>have any children.

230
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.024
<v Elisabetta Mori>My sister married but then

231
00:16:05.044 --> 00:16:09.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>divorced and ultimately just
decided to have a child on her

232
00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:09.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>own.

233
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.025
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I have a niece who is now in

234
00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:17.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>college, Oberlin College in Ohio.

235
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.028
<v Elisabetta Mori>And she's got this fascinating

236
00:16:22.088 --> 00:16:23.091
<v Elisabetta Mori>degree program.

237
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>Oberlin, of course, is a liberal

238
00:16:25.224 --> 00:16:25.867
<v Elisabetta Mori>arts college.

239
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one of Rosie's, her

240
00:16:31.207 --> 00:16:36.555
<v Elisabetta Mori>daughter's, interest is
international politics.

241
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, in particular, she's fluent in
Mandarin.

242
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.685
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one of the things that she
considered being involved with is

243
00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:50.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>some kind of job working with
China and things of that ill.

244
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>The other thing that she was
really interested in was robotics.

245
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.151
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, her specialty was
controlling robots to walk up and

246
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:02.772
<v Elisabetta Mori>down stairs.

247
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.731
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, she wasn't unclear exactly

248
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:12.218
<v Elisabetta Mori>what she wanted to do.

249
00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:12.321
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, to do.

250
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:17.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, Oberlin has this program
they call the 3 plus 2 program.

251
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you start and you do three
years of sort of liberal arts but

252
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>includes a lot of science-related
stuff.

253
00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:28.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then after three years, you
get a decision.

254
00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:32.131
<v Elisabetta Mori>You either do one more year and
just get your bachelor's degree in

255
00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:32.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>liberal arts.

256
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:35.086
<v Elisabetta Mori>Or you can go to one of six

257
00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:37.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>schools that they have partnered
with.

258
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.152
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these are schools like Caltech
and MIT and pretty serious

259
00:17:42.192 --> 00:17:43.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>technical schools.

260
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.583
<v Elisabetta Mori>And do two years and then you come

261
00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:51.252
<v Elisabetta Mori>out with a master's or a
bachelor's degree in science of

262
00:17:51.813 --> 00:17:53.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>whatever, in her case, mechanical
engineering.

263
00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.334
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then you'll also finish up and
get your bachelor's of liberal

264
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:00.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>arts.

265
00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:04.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, you then spent

266
00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:06.894
<v Elisabetta Mori>five years but you have two
bachelor's degrees.

267
00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it will be interesting to see.

268
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>She's coming up at the end of her

269
00:18:10.326 --> 00:18:10.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>third year.

270
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.305
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, she's going to have to decide

271
00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:13.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>which way she's going to go.

272
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.143
<v Elisabetta Mori>And when I last asked her, she

273
00:18:15.183 --> 00:18:16.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>still hadn't made up her mind.

274
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.463
<v Kirk McKusick>Thank you.

275
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.809
<v Kirk McKusick>So, let's go back to your
education.

276
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Kirk McKusick>So, what were your favorite
subjects and what made you choose

277
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:34.636
<v Kirk McKusick>your undergrad degree in
electrical engineering?

278
00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:41.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, math and science classes
were clearly my strong suit in

279
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>school and the ones that I enjoyed
the most.

280
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:52.769
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I had just a little bit of
stuff with computers because there

281
00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:58.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>was nothing in my high school at
that time that involved computers.

282
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I had an opportunity to do
some other stuff at the University

283
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>of Delaware where I'd gotten a
little bit of introduction to

284
00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:06.995
<v Elisabetta Mori>computers.

285
00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:09.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, what I wanted to do was

286
00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:10.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>computer science.

287
00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:12.848
<v Elisabetta Mori>But at that time, Cornell did not

288
00:19:12.928 --> 00:19:15.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>have a computer science
undergraduate degree.

289
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:21.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>They had kind of one in as for
advanced degrees but graduate

290
00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:21.436
<v Elisabetta Mori>degree.

291
00:19:22.622 --> 00:19:25.526
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the only option that I had or

292
00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:30.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>the closest I could get to was
electrical engineering and sort of

293
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.917
<v Elisabetta Mori>computer hardware design
specialization.

294
00:19:34.527 --> 00:19:35.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that's what I did.

295
00:19:35.501 --> 00:19:37.065
<v Elisabetta Mori>Although, I did manage to take

296
00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:41.636
<v Elisabetta Mori>some of the graduate level classes
in computer science.

297
00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, science.

298
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:42.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I got a little bit of that

299
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>under my belt.

300
00:19:43.693 --> 00:19:44.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>But belt.

301
00:19:44.513 --> 00:19:49.135
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I was limited in how many of
those courses that I would be able

302
00:19:49.195 --> 00:19:49.516
<v Elisabetta Mori>to take.

303
00:19:49.516 --> 00:19:49.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>Of take.

304
00:19:49.532 --> 00:19:52.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>Of course, they wanted me to stay
on and do a graduate degree.

305
00:19:52.614 --> 00:19:52.711
<v Elisabetta Mori>But degree.

306
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:58.673
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I ultimately chose to do that

307
00:19:59.494 --> 00:20:00.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>at Berkeley.

308
00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:02.931
<v Kirk McKusick>So, let's talk about your time at

309
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:03.393
<v Kirk McKusick>Berkeley.

310
00:20:04.242 --> 00:20:09.091
<v Kirk McKusick>So, in 1976, you got your degree

311
00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:12.216
<v Kirk McKusick>and moved to University of
California at Berkeley.

312
00:20:13.222 --> 00:20:17.201
<v Kirk McKusick>And there you received a master's
degree in computer science in 1980

313
00:20:17.511 --> 00:20:20.236
<v Kirk McKusick>and a master's degree in business
administration.

314
00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:26.647
<v Kirk McKusick>And then also a doctoral degree in
computer science in 1984.

315
00:20:26.647 --> 00:20:27.241
<v Kirk McKusick>In 1984, yes.

316
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.746
<v Kirk McKusick>So, can you talk about your time

317
00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:38.153
<v Kirk McKusick>at Berkeley and in particular the
times when you were sharing an

318
00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:47.810
<v Kirk McKusick>office with Bill Joy later?
No. Who in 1982 was going to

319
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.236
<v Kirk McKusick>co-found Sun Microsystems.

320
00:20:52.443 --> 00:20:59.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, when I graduated from Cornell,

321
00:20:59.413 --> 00:21:02.758
<v Elisabetta Mori>I then had to make a decision
about graduate school.

322
00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:03.011
<v Elisabetta Mori>And school.

323
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, I ended up applying to

324
00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:10.288
<v Elisabetta Mori>University of California at
Berkeley, University of Illinois

325
00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:20.198
<v Elisabetta Mori>in Champaign-Urbana, and MIT and
Carnegie Mellon.

326
00:21:21.684 --> 00:21:25.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I did a tour where I went and
visited each of these places.

327
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:33.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>Today, schools are very organized
around planning things and having

328
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:34.856
<v Elisabetta Mori>people that will take you around,
et cetera.

329
00:21:35.743 --> 00:21:37.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>But in those days, you were just
on your own.

330
00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:40.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I just sort of showed up and
walked into buildings and tried to

331
00:21:40.872 --> 00:21:41.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>find people.

332
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:46.850
<v Elisabetta Mori>And when I visited Berkeley, I ran

333
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.276
<v Elisabetta Mori>into Bill Joy and he said, oh,
well, we have this new PDP-11.

334
00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:54.633
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he sat me down and he said,
and you can edit files and you can

335
00:21:54.673 --> 00:21:55.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>play chess.

336
00:21:55.642 --> 00:21:57.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, I played chess for a while

337
00:21:57.088 --> 00:21:57.911
<v Elisabetta Mori>and that was about it.

338
00:21:59.344 --> 00:22:01.612
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, you know, I ended up, I

339
00:22:01.652 --> 00:22:02.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>think, having a meal with him.

340
00:22:02.635 --> 00:22:03.264
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that a meal with him.

341
00:22:03.264 --> 00:22:05.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was about the extent that
I interacted with people there.

342
00:22:07.564 --> 00:22:10.392
<v Elisabetta Mori>At the University of Illinois,
they came the closest to really

343
00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:11.395
<v Elisabetta Mori>having something organized.

344
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.346
<v Elisabetta Mori>They gave me a really in-depth

345
00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:16.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>tour and, you know, people to take
me around and all that.

346
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that was sort of my neat one
to go to.

347
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.867
<v Elisabetta Mori>Carnegie Mellon, I basically
could, you know, other than

348
00:22:23.907 --> 00:22:26.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>walking around the buildings and
seeing stuff, I really didn't

349
00:22:26.292 --> 00:22:27.194
<v Elisabetta Mori>interact with anybody.

350
00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.388
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the folks at MIT, you know,

351
00:22:31.428 --> 00:22:33.132
<v Elisabetta Mori>just said we don't do any of that
stuff.

352
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, I similarly just kind of
walked around the building a

353
00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:37.170
<v Elisabetta Mori>little bit.

354
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:42.228
<v Elisabetta Mori>In the end, neither MIT nor

355
00:22:42.288 --> 00:22:45.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>Carnegie Mellon offered me a
position.

356
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:48.831
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it was boiled down to the
University of Illinois or

357
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:49.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley.

358
00:22:49.922 --> 00:22:50.985
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I was much more impressed

359
00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:54.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>with, you know, the interaction at
the University of Illinois.

360
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>Except that Berkeley said, well,
we'll give you a first one-year

361
00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.073
<v Elisabetta Mori>fellowship, you know.

362
00:22:58.341 --> 00:22:59.867
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I was like, done, ding.

363
00:23:01.822 --> 00:23:03.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that's how I ended up at
Berkeley.

364
00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:13.453
<v Elisabetta Mori>And my interest, sort of the thing
that I had spent the most time on

365
00:23:13.533 --> 00:23:15.796
<v Elisabetta Mori>at Cornell was programming
languages.

366
00:23:16.942 --> 00:23:21.954
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in particular, I really liked
dealing with the assembly language

367
00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:22.656
<v Elisabetta Mori>level of things.

368
00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:22.902
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of things.

369
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:27.616
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you can't really do that as a
degree, but compilers compile into

370
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:27.836
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

371
00:23:27.836 --> 00:23:29.025
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so, you have to, you know,

372
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.415
<v Elisabetta Mori>it still lets you get your fingers
down in the low-level bits.

373
00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:35.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I decided to do programming
languages.

374
00:23:35.601 --> 00:23:42.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, connected up with
Professor Susan Graham, who was

375
00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:44.517
<v Elisabetta Mori>one of the programming language
folks at Berkeley.

376
00:23:44.517 --> 00:23:48.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And it turned out that Bill
Joy was also one of her students.

377
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, all of the professor's
grad students got crammed into one

378
00:23:53.553 --> 00:23:53.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>office.

379
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.464
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, there was this

380
00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:57.792
<v Elisabetta Mori>office with five desks or whatever
it was.

381
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.105
<v Elisabetta Mori>And each of us had a desk.

382
00:24:00.603 --> 00:24:02.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Bill had one and I had one.

383
00:24:02.261 --> 00:24:05.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there was one phone in the
office.

384
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:10.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, Bill was one of
these people that was, you know,

385
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.174
<v Elisabetta Mori>very outgoing and very, you know.

386
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.526
<v Elisabetta Mori>Someone once asked me to compare

387
00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:16.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>myself to Bill Joy.

388
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.581
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I said, you know, there's

389
00:24:17.602 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>really nothing I've done that I
couldn't do.

390
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.128
<v Elisabetta Mori>But he will do in a month what
would take me a year.

391
00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:29.531
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I mean, he just, he would pick
up a problem.

392
00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:31.489
<v Elisabetta Mori>He'd say, here's where we are.

393
00:24:31.489 --> 00:24:31.542
<v Elisabetta Mori>Here's we are.

394
00:24:31.542 --> 00:24:32.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>Here's where we want to get to.

395
00:24:33.281 --> 00:24:34.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>This is the shortest path, boom,

396
00:24:34.829 --> 00:24:35.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>from here to there.

397
00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:36.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And it would just be done.

398
00:24:37.421 --> 00:24:41.374
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you'd end up with this program
like what he did, the VI editor.

399
00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.211
<v Elisabetta Mori>He did the seashell.

400
00:24:44.765 --> 00:24:46.209
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you ended up with this code

401
00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:47.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>that you couldn't change a line.

402
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.547
<v Elisabetta Mori>It would just dissolve in a

403
00:24:49.628 --> 00:24:49.929
<v Elisabetta Mori>puddle.

404
00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:52.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because, you know, it was just

405
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>total hack.

406
00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:54.447
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it worked.

407
00:24:56.382 --> 00:25:01.451
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, a very interesting person to
be around, constantly saying, oh,

408
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:03.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>you should just try this or do
that or whatever.

409
00:25:04.643 --> 00:25:05.487
<v Elisabetta Mori>The phone would ring.

410
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.067
<v Elisabetta Mori>You would pick it up.

411
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.268
<v Elisabetta Mori>You wouldn't even, like, answer
it.

412
00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:09.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>You'd You'd just pick it up and
hand it to Bill.

413
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.466
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because, you know, 99% of the
calls coming in were people that

414
00:25:13.526 --> 00:25:17.453
<v Elisabetta Mori>wanted to talk to Bill Joy about
whatever it was that Bill was

415
00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:18.435
<v Elisabetta Mori>working on at the moment.

416
00:25:19.902 --> 00:25:22.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it was a very interesting and

417
00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:24.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>dynamic environment to be working
in.

418
00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:30.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>The other thing, though, was I had
this fellowship, but it was only

419
00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:31.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>for the first year.

420
00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.025
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And it was a special thing

421
00:25:33.146 --> 00:25:36.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was, you know, I couldn't
apply to get it again the next

422
00:25:36.114 --> 00:25:36.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>year.

423
00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:36.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because year.

424
00:25:36.492 --> 00:25:38.211
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because it was only for first-year
students.

425
00:25:39.542 --> 00:25:46.675
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I ended up getting connected
up with the Hughes Aircraft

426
00:25:46.715 --> 00:25:47.096
<v Elisabetta Mori>Company.

427
00:25:48.343 --> 00:25:49.666
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they had these fellowships

428
00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:52.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>where you would work for them in
the summertime.

429
00:25:53.401 --> 00:25:56.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then in the other nine months
of the year, they essentially paid

430
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:57.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>for you to go to school.

431
00:25:59.902 --> 00:26:01.884
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, that's how I ended up

432
00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:10.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>working in Los Angeles for a
number of years before eventually

433
00:26:10.755 --> 00:26:12.577
<v Elisabetta Mori>just being full-time students.

434
00:26:16.486 --> 00:26:18.930
<v Kirk McKusick>So, you moved to Berkeley.

435
00:26:24.403 --> 00:26:31.793
<v Kirk McKusick>And then, you know, you had first
– you were sharing your room with

436
00:26:32.053 --> 00:26:35.578
<v Kirk McKusick>Bill Joy when you were, like, a
graduate student.

437
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:43.455
<v Kirk McKusick>And how did you get involved in
the Berkeley Software Distribution

438
00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:45.407
<v Kirk McKusick>Project?
What happened?

439
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.781
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

440
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:54.695
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, Bill had written a number of

441
00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:54.956
<v Elisabetta Mori>things.

442
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>He'd written the VI Editor.

443
00:26:56.542 --> 00:26:58.771
<v Elisabetta Mori>He'd written the Pascal
Interpreter.

444
00:27:00.004 --> 00:27:01.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he'd written the C-Shell.

445
00:27:02.862 --> 00:27:04.426
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these were just things that

446
00:27:04.487 --> 00:27:07.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>you would put onto an existing
UNIX system.

447
00:27:07.234 --> 00:27:11.928
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, So, at the time, we were
running UNIX version 6, later

448
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:15.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>using UNIX version 7 on PDP-11
computers.

449
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these were just programs that
you would add to the set of things

450
00:27:20.489 --> 00:27:22.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>that were already part of that.

451
00:27:23.762 --> 00:27:25.300
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, that would have been about

452
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>1978.

453
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:30.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>He put together what he called the

454
00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:32.134
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley Software Distribution.

455
00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:33.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And it's kind of like a rock

456
00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:34.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>album.

457
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.725
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, the first album they put

458
00:27:35.846 --> 00:27:38.334
<v Elisabetta Mori>out is just the name of the album
is the name of the group.

459
00:27:38.803 --> 00:27:41.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, oh my goodness, they now
have a second album.

460
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, what are they going to do,
you know?

461
00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:46.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it was – originally, it
was just BSD.

462
00:27:46.962 --> 00:27:51.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, later, he had, you know,
a new distribution he wanted to

463
00:27:51.794 --> 00:27:52.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>put together.

464
00:27:52.235 --> 00:27:52.946
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, Well, what is he going to

465
00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:55.231
<v Elisabetta Mori>call this?
So, So, the first one was just

466
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:55.592
<v Elisabetta Mori>BSD.

467
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:56.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>The next one was 2BSD.

468
00:27:57.281 --> 00:27:59.751
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, after that, you know,
the numbering became a little more

469
00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>clear.

470
00:28:00.943 --> 00:28:02.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, historically, we often call

471
00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:03.852
<v Elisabetta Mori>that first distribution 1BSD.

472
00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:05.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it wasn't actually called

473
00:28:05.989 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

474
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.366
<v Elisabetta Mori>It was actually just called BSD.

475
00:28:08.621 --> 00:28:12.011
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in those days, you know, we
didn't have the networking that we

476
00:28:12.051 --> 00:28:13.475
<v Elisabetta Mori>have today.

477
00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:15.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, really, the way you

478
00:28:15.247 --> 00:28:17.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>distributed stuff was on magnetic
tape.

479
00:28:18.324 --> 00:28:21.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, he had – he would, you
know, put a tape.

480
00:28:21.641 --> 00:28:25.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>If you wanted to get it, he'd
mount a tape, write the stuff onto

481
00:28:25.753 --> 00:28:28.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>the tape, and then mail the tape
to you.

482
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.488
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, all these phone calls that
were coming in as people that

483
00:28:31.548 --> 00:28:32.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>wanted to order this.

484
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:36.708
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he realized that, as a

485
00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:39.334
<v Elisabetta Mori>graduate student, he didn't have
the money to keep buying all these

486
00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:39.674
<v Elisabetta Mori>tapes.

487
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.724
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, he instituted some kind of

488
00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:45.501
<v Elisabetta Mori>fee, like $30 or something, so
that, you know, he'd have the

489
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:48.451
<v Elisabetta Mori>money to buy the tape and pay the
postage to mail the thing off.

490
00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:49.765
<v Elisabetta Mori>All right.

491
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.303
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the first distribution that he

492
00:28:51.383 --> 00:28:54.151
<v Elisabetta Mori>did was just the three utilities
that he had done.

493
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then some others of us that
were in his office and in the

494
00:28:58.808 --> 00:29:01.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>department started doing other
things as well.

495
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.111
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, the second Berkeley
distribution was the things that

496
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:10.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>Bill had done, plus this other
stuff that many of others of us

497
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.431
<v Elisabetta Mori>had done.

498
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.547
<v Elisabetta Mori>For example, Peter Kessler, one of

499
00:29:14.608 --> 00:29:18.461
<v Elisabetta Mori>the other Sue Graham graduate
students and I, had written

500
00:29:18.521 --> 00:29:23.824
<v Elisabetta Mori>something called GPROF, the
Graphical Profiler, which would

501
00:29:23.964 --> 00:29:26.952
<v Elisabetta Mori>essentially give you a detailed
analysis of where your program was

502
00:29:26.992 --> 00:29:27.894
<v Elisabetta Mori>spending its time.

503
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:30.144
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, that was one of the things

504
00:29:30.244 --> 00:29:34.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>that ended up being added into
this 2BSD distribution.

505
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.592
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's bizarre that that program
was like the go-to thing for doing

506
00:29:40.632 --> 00:29:44.269
<v Elisabetta Mori>that for almost 30 years, before
better things came along.

507
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I remember my sister at some
point writing to me and said, oh,

508
00:29:48.261 --> 00:29:51.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>yeah, we were trying to figure out
why our database was running slow.

509
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, we were using GPROF to
figure it out.

510
00:29:53.461 --> 00:29:56.192
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I looked at the manual page
and it says that you wrote it.

511
00:29:56.192 --> 00:29:56.251
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I it.

512
00:29:56.251 --> 00:29:57.306
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I was like, yeah.

513
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like small world.

514
00:30:00.561 --> 00:30:03.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>Anyway, so, the second

515
00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:07.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>distribution, again, was just
utilities that you would add on

516
00:30:07.287 --> 00:30:10.233
<v Elisabetta Mori>top of an existing distribution.

517
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.483
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then, what ended up happening

518
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:25.716
<v Elisabetta Mori>was that some of the research that
was going on at Berkeley was a

519
00:30:26.076 --> 00:30:27.017
<v Elisabetta Mori>thing called Vaxima.

520
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.350
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it was a system for doing

521
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>numerical analysis.

522
00:30:33.682 --> 00:30:35.469
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it was written in Lisp.

523
00:30:36.842 --> 00:30:40.682
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Lisp is one of these things
where you start it up, and by the

524
00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:43.913
<v Elisabetta Mori>time you get to a prompt, you're
already using half the memory on

525
00:30:43.933 --> 00:30:44.414
<v Elisabetta Mori>the machine.

526
00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:45.345
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And then, when you actually

527
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>want to do something, it needs
more.

528
00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:52.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it just was overwhelming,
the PDP-11, because the PDP-11 was

529
00:30:52.273 --> 00:30:55.911
<v Elisabetta Mori>a 16-bit machine, and so, it could
only handle up to 64 kilobytes.

530
00:30:56.482 --> 00:30:57.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>Then, you were out of address
space.

531
00:30:58.761 --> 00:31:04.292
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, they had bought one of these
brand-new 32-bit machines from

532
00:31:04.372 --> 00:31:06.156
<v Elisabetta Mori>Digital Equipment Corporation
called the Vax.

533
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:12.755
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And the Vax came with VMS, the
operating system that DEC

534
00:31:12.815 --> 00:31:13.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>provided.

535
00:31:13.842 --> 00:31:15.506
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, of course, VMS was sort of an

536
00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:19.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>old-style, batch-ish kind of
operating system, and people were

537
00:31:19.902 --> 00:31:22.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>used to Unix, and they wanted to
be able to sit at a terminal and

538
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:26.188
<v Elisabetta Mori>type stuff and compile things and
do all that kind of interactive

539
00:31:26.248 --> 00:31:26.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>thing.

540
00:31:27.681 --> 00:31:31.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, there was a move to bring

541
00:31:31.832 --> 00:31:33.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>Unix over to the Vax.

542
00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:36.146
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the initial port of that was

543
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:38.993
<v Elisabetta Mori>done, actually, by the folks at
Bell Labs, and it was called 32V.

544
00:31:40.701 --> 00:31:47.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it was just a raw, basic, take
what ran on the PDP-11 and get it

545
00:31:47.595 --> 00:31:48.557
<v Elisabetta Mori>to run on the Vax.

546
00:31:48.557 --> 00:31:48.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it on the Vax.

547
00:31:48.811 --> 00:31:51.408
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it didn't use any of the
paging hardware on the Vax or a

548
00:31:51.488 --> 00:31:54.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>lot of the capabilities that the
Vax had.

549
00:31:55.062 --> 00:31:59.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>It just looked sort of like a
PDP-11 with a bigger address

550
00:31:59.032 --> 00:31:59.273
<v Elisabetta Mori>space.

551
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.965
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the people that had paid for

552
00:32:03.026 --> 00:32:06.292
<v Elisabetta Mori>this, or the grant that had paid
for this, was the people doing the

553
00:32:06.332 --> 00:32:07.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>numerical analysis stuff.

554
00:32:08.582 --> 00:32:10.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they needed the virtual

555
00:32:10.248 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>memory.

556
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.886
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, this port of Unix didn't

557
00:32:12.946 --> 00:32:14.973
<v Elisabetta Mori>have it, but the VMS did.

558
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.626
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, they said, well, we'll run

559
00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:17.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>VMS.

560
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.484
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Bill was like, oh, that's

561
00:32:19.545 --> 00:32:21.210
<v Elisabetta Mori>terrible, we can't possibly do
that.

562
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.612
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, we need to get Unix that
runs on the Vax to actually be

563
00:32:28.692 --> 00:32:30.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>able to use the paging hardware.

564
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:34.287
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Bill's philosophy was always,

565
00:32:34.527 --> 00:32:37.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>why come up with a good idea when
you can steal a better one?

566
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.326
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it turned out that there was
another graduate student that was

567
00:32:41.386 --> 00:32:47.985
<v Elisabetta Mori>working on a virtual memory system
thesis or whatever, Ozop Babagalu,

568
00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:49.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>from Italy.

569
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:54.707
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, Bill and Ozop got together

570
00:32:55.048 --> 00:32:58.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>and said, let's take what you've
got, and we're going to put it in

571
00:32:58.715 --> 00:32:58.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>here.

572
00:32:59.802 --> 00:33:00.984
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course, there was only one

573
00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:04.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>Vax, and you need to keep
rebooting it and testing it and so

574
00:33:04.934 --> 00:33:04.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>on.

575
00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:07.487
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the only period that that

576
00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:10.034
<v Elisabetta Mori>could happen was the Christmas
break.

577
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:13.209
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the students all left about
the middle of December, and then

578
00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:15.134
<v Elisabetta Mori>they all came back in about the
middle of January.

579
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.908
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, there was this four-week
window where the machine could

580
00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.154
<v Elisabetta Mori>basically be used for development.

581
00:33:20.842 --> 00:33:21.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>And for whatever reason, I had

582
00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:25.844
<v Elisabetta Mori>decided to be around during that
period, because it was one of the

583
00:33:25.884 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>few times when there wasn't so
much demand for the machine that

584
00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.356
<v Elisabetta Mori>you could actually get a fair
amount of useful time on it.

585
00:33:32.081 --> 00:33:37.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, during that time, you'd be
sitting there, and it would come

586
00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:42.778
<v Elisabetta Mori>up with VMS, and you'd be trying
to do stuff.

587
00:33:42.778 --> 00:33:42.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>And to do stuff.

588
00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.406
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then a message would come

589
00:33:44.426 --> 00:33:47.636
<v Elisabetta Mori>saying, going down to boot Unix
and VM Unix.

590
00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:50.469
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, then it would come up on
VM Unix, and you'd be working away

591
00:33:50.489 --> 00:33:52.435
<v Elisabetta Mori>and working away, and suddenly it
would all freeze.

592
00:33:52.435 --> 00:33:56.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And then about a minute later,
the VMS prompt would come up.

593
00:33:57.062 --> 00:34:00.771
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it was more and more and more
time that it was coming up on VM

594
00:34:00.832 --> 00:34:02.817
<v Elisabetta Mori>Unix, and less and less time that
it was VMS.

595
00:34:02.817 --> 00:34:03.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>And VMS.

596
00:34:03.033 --> 00:34:04.749
<v Elisabetta Mori>And really, they weren't quite

597
00:34:04.829 --> 00:34:07.444
<v Elisabetta Mori>ready when the students all came
back, but back, but they somehow

598
00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:10.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>persevered and got through that
two-week break-in period.

599
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:13.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>And after that, we never saw VMS
again.

600
00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:15.154
<v Elisabetta Mori>It was just VM Unix that was
running.

601
00:34:16.141 --> 00:34:22.514
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the contribution that came out
was, for the first time, a whole

602
00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:22.955
<v Elisabetta Mori>system.

603
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.103
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, it was the operating system,

604
00:34:25.164 --> 00:34:30.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>and all the utilities, and all of
the additions that Phil Joy had

605
00:34:30.254 --> 00:34:30.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>done.

606
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:39.192
<v Elisabetta Mori>And now, Bill is still coding, and

607
00:34:39.292 --> 00:34:42.460
<v Elisabetta Mori>being a student, and by the way,
doing these distributions, except

608
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>that now, there's this huge demand
for it.

609
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.731
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, at least 100 institutions
wanted to get it.

610
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, the phone is ringing off
the hook.

611
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.848
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, now, it's not just the stuff
that Bill has written, but it's

612
00:34:59.888 --> 00:35:04.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>got all this Unix code in it as
well, which, of course, is owned

613
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>by AT&T.

614
00:35:05.641 --> 00:35:09.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it wasn't open source in

615
00:35:09.472 --> 00:35:09.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>that sense.

616
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.464
<v Elisabetta Mori>You had to have a license from

617
00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:13.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>AT&T in order to be allowed to
have Unix.

618
00:35:15.664 --> 00:35:20.263
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, Bill's verification of
this was, Oh, hello, you want it?

619
00:35:20.303 --> 00:35:20.524
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

620
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>You have a Unix license, right?

621
00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:22.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>Great.

622
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay, I'll send you the tape.

623
00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:30.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, that didn't really hold
muster with the university

624
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:31.175
<v Elisabetta Mori>lawyers.

625
00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:35.647
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it was decided that they

626
00:35:35.707 --> 00:35:40.796
<v Elisabetta Mori>really needed to get somebody else
who was going to deal with that.

627
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:46.667
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, the other thing that was
happening at the same time was

628
00:35:46.827 --> 00:35:56.125
<v Elisabetta Mori>that DARPA was beginning to be
interested in, well, the thing

629
00:35:56.165 --> 00:35:59.132
<v Elisabetta Mori>that they were pushing on was to
build what would ultimately become

630
00:35:59.152 --> 00:35:59.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>the Internet.

631
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.044
<v Elisabetta Mori>It was called the DARPAnet in

632
00:36:01.064 --> 00:36:01.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>those days.

633
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.905
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they had all these

634
00:36:04.965 --> 00:36:07.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>researchers, and they all had
different hardware, and different

635
00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:11.189
<v Elisabetta Mori>software, and trying to exchange
stuff between each other was just

636
00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:12.252
<v Elisabetta Mori>painful and slow.

637
00:36:13.761 --> 00:36:15.546
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, they wanted to pick a

638
00:36:16.087 --> 00:36:19.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>hardware base, they wanted to pick
a software base, and then they

639
00:36:19.882 --> 00:36:23.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>wanted all of their programs to
use that.

640
00:36:24.842 --> 00:36:27.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, they first of all decided that
the VAX was the right machine

641
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.729
<v Elisabetta Mori>because it was low enough cost
that that they could afford to buy

642
00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:33.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>one for everybody.

643
00:36:34.902 --> 00:36:36.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then there was this initial

644
00:36:36.626 --> 00:36:40.180
<v Elisabetta Mori>drive that it should be, you know,
it's going to be a VAX, and it's

645
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Elisabetta Mori>going to be the vendor-supported
software, which is going to be

646
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>VMS.

647
00:36:44.421 --> 00:36:46.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>And people were like, we want, you

648
00:36:46.749 --> 00:36:48.173
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, we want Unix-like thing.

649
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.663
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, there was a big debate,

650
00:36:49.723 --> 00:36:55.314
<v Elisabetta Mori>but ultimately it was decided that
they would in fact use VSD Unix.

651
00:36:57.001 --> 00:37:02.468
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, a grant came to Berkeley
to essentially get the networking

652
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.692
<v Elisabetta Mori>and ultimately to also then get
the networking incorporated into

653
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:13.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

654
00:37:15.242 --> 00:37:20.772
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it also meant that then what

655
00:37:20.892 --> 00:37:22.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>became the CSRG got formed.

656
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>In particular, a full-time

657
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:31.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>administrator got hired, and her
job was to actually verify that

658
00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:32.813
<v Elisabetta Mori>people had these licenses.

659
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.903
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they had to send the

660
00:37:33.923 --> 00:37:37.803
<v Elisabetta Mori>copies, and she had to call up
AT&T and say, is this a valid

661
00:37:37.843 --> 00:37:39.550
<v Elisabetta Mori>license, and they'd say, yes, it
is.

662
00:37:42.005 --> 00:37:46.676
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, and that meant then that Bill
didn't have to do that anymore.

663
00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:46.696
<v Elisabetta Mori>It anymore.

664
00:37:46.696 --> 00:37:49.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>It also meant that he got his own

665
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:50.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>office, so he was in a different
office.

666
00:37:51.344 --> 00:37:53.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>He didn't have to share an office
with these other students any

667
00:37:53.973 --> 00:37:54.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>longer.

668
00:37:55.824 --> 00:38:00.694
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, at any rate, that started

669
00:38:00.835 --> 00:38:04.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>getting underway, and there's the
whole story about how that goes

670
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.755
<v Elisabetta Mori>on, which perhaps we'll get to
eventually.

671
00:38:06.483 --> 00:38:11.534
<v Elisabetta Mori>But my interaction with Bill at
that point would have sort of

672
00:38:11.574 --> 00:38:18.932
<v Elisabetta Mori>fallen off a bit, but bit, but for
the fact that my funding as a

673
00:38:19.012 --> 00:38:21.517
<v Elisabetta Mori>student was coming through my
advisor.

674
00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:24.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, And, I mean, she was
well-known.

675
00:38:25.062 --> 00:38:31.606
<v Elisabetta Mori>She was the editor of transactions
on programming languages, and

676
00:38:31.606 --> 00:38:33.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>highly respected languages, and
highly respected in the field.

677
00:38:35.663 --> 00:38:38.384
<v Elisabetta Mori>She had no difficulty in raising
money, but she was a little bit

678
00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:41.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>forgetful about some of the things
she needed to do on that.

679
00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:49.565
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, as a graduate student, you
get paid 49.5% time, because if

680
00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:52.715
<v Elisabetta Mori>they paid you 50% time, then
they'd have to give you benefits.

681
00:38:52.715 --> 00:38:52.765
<v Elisabetta Mori>But if it's 49.5%, you benefits.

682
00:38:52.765 --> 00:38:53.365
<v Elisabetta Mori>But if it's 49.5%, then they

683
00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:53.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't.

684
00:38:56.182 --> 00:38:57.945
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then in the summertime, they

685
00:38:57.985 --> 00:39:04.401
<v Elisabetta Mori>let you ramp up to full-time for
89 days, because if it was 90

686
00:39:05.008 --> 00:39:06.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>days, then they'd have to give you
benefits.

687
00:39:06.493 --> 00:39:06.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>But benefits.

688
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>But for 89 days, you get full, and

689
00:39:08.307 --> 00:39:09.409
<v Elisabetta Mori>then you go back to 49.5%.

690
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.308
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, during your school year, your

691
00:39:13.348 --> 00:39:15.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>checking account is going down and
down and down.

692
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, by June, you're on fumes.

693
00:39:19.802 --> 00:39:21.227
<v Elisabetta Mori>But you're going to have two weeks

694
00:39:21.307 --> 00:39:24.527
<v Elisabetta Mori>that are going to be half-time,
and then and then two weeks that

695
00:39:24.547 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>are going to be full-time.

696
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.624
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, So, you get sort of

697
00:39:25.664 --> 00:39:26.751
<v Elisabetta Mori>three-quarter time pay.

698
00:39:26.763 --> 00:39:28.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that first sort of chunk of

699
00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:28.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>money comes in.

700
00:39:29.882 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, end of the month comes,

701
00:39:33.591 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Elisabetta Mori>and instead of getting that, I get
the first two weeks of half-time

702
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:38.775
<v Elisabetta Mori>and nothing for the rest.

703
00:39:38.775 --> 00:39:39.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's like, for the rest.

704
00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:41.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's like, oh my God, they
didn't know I was going to be here

705
00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:41.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>for the summer.

706
00:39:41.574 --> 00:39:41.624
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I for the summer.

707
00:39:41.624 --> 00:39:44.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I go running over to the
administrators and say, oh, what's

708
00:39:44.913 --> 00:39:45.451
<v Elisabetta Mori>going on?
And on?

709
00:39:45.451 --> 00:39:49.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they say, oh, well, your
advisor hasn't given us the new

710
00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.555
<v Elisabetta Mori>numbers that we need.

711
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:50.601
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we need.

712
00:39:50.601 --> 00:39:55.455
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, I go back to my advisor,
and she says, oh, gosh, I forgot

713
00:39:55.475 --> 00:39:55.716
<v Elisabetta Mori>about that.

714
00:39:55.716 --> 00:39:55.973
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, you know, forgot about that.

715
00:39:55.973 --> 00:39:58.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, you know, I'll get that
sorted out, you know, in a month.

716
00:39:59.685 --> 00:40:02.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, meantime, I definitely needed
some money.

717
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:08.213
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I went downstairs to Bill's
office, and I said, so, Bill, our

718
00:40:08.253 --> 00:40:09.777
<v Elisabetta Mori>advisor, you know, I told his
story.

719
00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:13.873
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, basically, could you just,
like, you know, put me on for the

720
00:40:13.934 --> 00:40:15.348
<v Elisabetta Mori>summer, you know, and you know,
and give me something to do?

721
00:40:16.222 --> 00:40:19.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, you and I know that
I'm basically just going to be

722
00:40:19.288 --> 00:40:22.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>working on my research, but, you
know, I'll do something.

723
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.929
<v Elisabetta Mori>He says, well, I got this idea for
a file system, and, you know, I

724
00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:28.344
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of sketched it out and said,
if you could just sort of, you

725
00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:31.983
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, put that together and, you
know, maybe come up with a little

726
00:40:32.024 --> 00:40:33.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>prototype or something, that'd be
great.

727
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, of course, suckered me in,
and I spent the whole summer

728
00:40:37.088 --> 00:40:38.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>working on this file system.

729
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, end of summer

730
00:40:41.808 --> 00:40:43.472
<v Elisabetta Mori>comes, and I say, well, here it
is.

731
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.572
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, and I had it running in
simulation.

732
00:40:46.572 --> 00:40:49.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I said, well, why don't we just
drop it into the operating system

733
00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:51.704
<v Elisabetta Mori>and see how it works?
And, And, you know, there was some

734
00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:55.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>locking issues and a few other
things, but it more or less came

735
00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:55.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>up, and it worked.

736
00:40:56.602 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he said, oh, this is

737
00:40:59.371 --> 00:40:59.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>fantastic.

738
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>This is like, you know, runs 10

739
00:41:01.164 --> 00:41:03.192
<v Elisabetta Mori>times faster than the one that was
there before.

740
00:41:03.301 --> 00:41:04.105
<v Elisabetta Mori>That's so great.

741
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.045
<v Elisabetta Mori>Of course, you know, we need to

742
00:41:07.085 --> 00:41:11.456
<v Elisabetta Mori>release this, and except there's
just a couple other things.

743
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:15.731
<v Elisabetta Mori>We need a dump program, a restore
program, the check program, you

744
00:41:15.771 --> 00:41:16.814
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
dah, dah.

745
00:41:16.814 --> 00:41:21.828
<v Elisabetta Mori>18 months later, I finally had all
that done, and that's part of the

746
00:41:21.868 --> 00:41:25.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>reason that it took me more than
eight years to get my degree.

747
00:41:27.561 --> 00:41:32.553
<v Elisabetta Mori>In fact, the university pretty
much doesn't want you there for

748
00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:33.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>more than seven years.

749
00:41:33.481 --> 00:41:35.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>They make it, you know, difficult.

750
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the way they do it is they,
you know, they say, well, you

751
00:41:39.726 --> 00:41:45.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, you've got too many credits
on your, units on your transcript.

752
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:49.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>But what you can do is you can
file for a degree, and then the

753
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>units that are needed for that
degree gets sort of pulled out of

754
00:41:52.115 --> 00:41:52.496
<v Elisabetta Mori>the pool.

755
00:41:53.004 --> 00:41:54.690
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so then you can start

756
00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:55.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>collecting some more.

757
00:41:55.875 --> 00:41:55.923
<v Elisabetta Mori>So some more.

758
00:41:55.923 --> 00:41:58.792
<v Elisabetta Mori>So you may notice I have two
master's degrees along with my

759
00:41:58.812 --> 00:42:05.191
<v Elisabetta Mori>PhD. And part of that was to be
able to extend the amount of time

760
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:06.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I was able to be there.

761
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>Although the, I mean, the master's

762
00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:15.573
<v Elisabetta Mori>degree in computer science, that
was the sole purpose for doing

763
00:42:15.593 --> 00:42:16.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was to get the units off.

764
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.383
<v Elisabetta Mori>The one in business administration

765
00:42:19.483 --> 00:42:26.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually came about because for a
graduate degree, for a PhD,

766
00:42:26.372 --> 00:42:29.757
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley requires you to do stuff
that's outside your area that

767
00:42:29.777 --> 00:42:30.337
<v Elisabetta Mori>you're studying.

768
00:42:31.545 --> 00:42:33.431
<v Elisabetta Mori>And historically, that was like

769
00:42:33.511 --> 00:42:34.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>foreign language or something.

770
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:39.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>But a lot of people sort of, you

771
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.356
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, they go and take some math
classes or something.

772
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:45.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I said, well, hey, you know,
you want me to do something

773
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:49.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>outside this, you know, I've
always been interested in business

774
00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:49.316
<v Elisabetta Mori>stuff.

775
00:42:50.545 --> 00:42:52.612
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, but you had to take courses.

776
00:42:54.264 --> 00:42:56.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course, I didn't have all
the prerequisites that I needed

777
00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:56.973
<v Elisabetta Mori>for that.

778
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.202
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I had to take all these sort of

779
00:42:58.282 --> 00:43:02.410
<v Elisabetta Mori>undergraduate economics classes
and other things to be eligible to

780
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.935
<v Elisabetta Mori>take the graduate classes in
business.

781
00:43:06.263 --> 00:43:10.094
<v Elisabetta Mori>The other thing in business is you
normally specialize in something.

782
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when you normally you get an
MBA, it's like an MBA in marketing

783
00:43:13.827 --> 00:43:18.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>or an MBA in finance or an MBA in
whatever.

784
00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:21.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And I mean, I didn't want to
do that.

785
00:43:22.702 --> 00:43:25.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>What I wanted was just sort of a
general understanding of business.

786
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:33.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, it turned out that the dean
of the business school was having

787
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>some trouble dealing with the
computers in the computer center

788
00:43:36.515 --> 00:43:38.357
<v Elisabetta Mori>that were being used by the
business school.

789
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.806
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I ended up helping him
figure out how to get those things

790
00:43:42.866 --> 00:43:47.312
<v Elisabetta Mori>working in an appropriate way,
because the computer center was

791
00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:51.838
<v Elisabetta Mori>just running him around in circles
in ways they shouldn't have done.

792
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:54.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And I said, look, just go in
and tell them this, this and this.

793
00:43:55.103 --> 00:43:58.274
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, just say you have
to do those three things.

794
00:43:58.274 --> 00:44:00.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>You You know, you're you're the
one that providing the service.

795
00:44:00.854 --> 00:44:00.924
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these are the services the
service.

796
00:44:00.924 --> 00:44:01.364
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these are the services I need
from you.

797
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.551
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he did that and suddenly he
started getting what he needed.

798
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I became his darling because I
could, you know, essentially help

799
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.913
<v Elisabetta Mori>him maneuver around things.

800
00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:18.550
<v Elisabetta Mori>He was a very famous person and

801
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:19.753
<v Elisabetta Mori>very, very busy.

802
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.545
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he, of course, had a secretary

803
00:44:22.565 --> 00:44:26.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>that would guard the door to make
sure that, you know, nobody was

804
00:44:26.432 --> 00:44:27.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>going to waste this guy's time.

805
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.906
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he'd agreed to be my one of

806
00:44:33.186 --> 00:44:39.915
<v Elisabetta Mori>the people on my committee in
particular because I needed

807
00:44:39.955 --> 00:44:40.937
<v Elisabetta Mori>somebody outside the school.

808
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>So it was sort of this tit for

809
00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:42.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>tat.

810
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.165
<v Elisabetta Mori>He would do that for me and I

811
00:44:44.185 --> 00:44:45.211
<v Elisabetta Mori>would do these other things for
him.

812
00:44:45.681 --> 00:44:48.388
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I would come and I would need
some like little piece of

813
00:44:48.428 --> 00:44:50.794
<v Elisabetta Mori>paperwork or something filled out
and signed.

814
00:44:51.763 --> 00:44:53.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, I needed like five
minutes of his time.

815
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.170
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I would say to the
secretary, look, I need five

816
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:57.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>minutes of his time.

817
00:44:58.641 --> 00:45:00.105
<v Elisabetta Mori>And she said, look, the last time

818
00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:02.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>you were in there, you were in
there for half an hour and you

819
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>completely messed up his schedule
for the whole day.

820
00:45:04.442 --> 00:45:05.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>So just don't do that.

821
00:45:06.763 --> 00:45:07.929
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I'm like, fine, fine.

822
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I went in, you know, and he
immediately wanted to start

823
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.053
<v Elisabetta Mori>talking about this other stuff.

824
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.806
<v Elisabetta Mori>I'm like, I'm told that, you know,

825
00:45:13.826 --> 00:45:15.872
<v Elisabetta Mori>you have this incredible schedule
and I have to get out.

826
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.127
<v Elisabetta Mori>And nope, nothing would do.

827
00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:18.467
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was in there for 20 minutes.

828
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.366
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I came out there were like
three people in suits sitting in

829
00:45:21.406 --> 00:45:24.054
<v Elisabetta Mori>the waiting room and she gave me
the look of death.

830
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.772
<v Elisabetta Mori>But anyway, I continued
interacting with him.

831
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one of the benefits that came
out of that was I said, look, you

832
00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:34.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, I don't want to specialize
in one thing.

833
00:45:34.095 --> 00:45:36.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I want to, you know, I want to
get a master's degree, but, you

834
00:45:36.729 --> 00:45:37.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, in a broad area.

835
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.203
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he said, oh, well, what you

836
00:45:39.243 --> 00:45:43.453
<v Elisabetta Mori>want is not an MBA, but an MSBA, a
Masters of Science in Business

837
00:45:43.493 --> 00:45:44.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>Administration.

838
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because that way, that's for

839
00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:50.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>people going on to a PhD and it's
the consolation prize if you don't

840
00:45:50.354 --> 00:45:50.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>finish.

841
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.824
<v Elisabetta Mori>He said, but for that, you have to

842
00:45:52.864 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Elisabetta Mori>show competency in three areas
like you would for any PhD. And so

843
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:06.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was able to do finance,
marketing, and entrepreneurship.

844
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:11.890
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, so if you give me a
10K report, I know exactly where

845
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.135
<v Elisabetta Mori>to go look to find the skeletons
in the closet.

846
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:16.871
<v Elisabetta Mori>I couldn't write one, but I can do
that.

847
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.169
<v Elisabetta Mori>A marketing plan, I couldn't write
one, but I can sure analyze and

848
00:46:21.189 --> 00:46:24.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>tell you which ones are crap and
which ones are good.

849
00:46:25.162 --> 00:46:28.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>And entrepreneurship, of course,
has been invaluable to me because

850
00:46:28.068 --> 00:46:32.096
<v Elisabetta Mori>I've dealt with probably 30
startup companies in my career.

851
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was the single most
valuable thing I got out of that.

852
00:46:36.354 --> 00:46:37.323
<v Elisabetta Mori>So anyway, of that.

853
00:46:37.323 --> 00:46:38.326
<v Elisabetta Mori>So anyway, that's how I ended up

854
00:46:38.406 --> 00:46:41.034
<v Elisabetta Mori>getting a Masters of Science in
Business Administration.

855
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:46.509
<v Elisabetta Mori>And even though I don't do that
for a living, for the most part,

856
00:46:46.869 --> 00:46:49.153
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was a very, very valuable
little thing to pick up.

857
00:46:51.401 --> 00:46:56.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>OK, and then that pretty much
answered your question.

858
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.822
<v Kirk McKusick>Oh, yes.

859
00:46:58.544 --> 00:47:00.469
<v Kirk McKusick>So you finished your PhD in

860
00:47:00.469 --> 00:47:02.442
<v Kirk McKusick>December 1984, right?
Yes.

861
00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:11.453
<v Kirk McKusick>And then in January 1985, you took
over the Berkeley Software

862
00:47:11.493 --> 00:47:12.655
<v Kirk McKusick>Distribution Project.

863
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.343
<v Kirk McKusick>You were a research computer

864
00:47:15.383 --> 00:47:23.016
<v Kirk McKusick>scientist at the Berkeley Computer
System Research Group, RG, right?

865
00:47:23.603 --> 00:47:23.783
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

866
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.204
<v Kirk McKusick>So what do you think were your

867
00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:32.291
<v Kirk McKusick>major contributions to the
project?

868
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:39.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I'm going to start slightly
before that transition happened.

869
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was, well, sort of the
first big contribution I made was

870
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.835
<v Elisabetta Mori>the Pascal compiler.

871
00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:53.726
<v Elisabetta Mori>And although Pascal, although

872
00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:57.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>important at that time, faded away
fairly quickly.

873
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>The other major contribution I
made was the fast file system,

874
00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:05.094
<v Elisabetta Mori>which was that summer project that
turned into a two year project.

875
00:48:06.682 --> 00:48:08.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that is still in use today.

876
00:48:09.921 --> 00:48:12.946
<v Elisabetta Mori>In fact, I've had up until very

877
00:48:12.986 --> 00:48:17.753
<v Elisabetta Mori>recently a consulting contract
with Netflix because they use that

878
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>for their content distribution.

879
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.224
<v Elisabetta Mori>And certainly at their peak, they

880
00:48:22.264 --> 00:48:27.373
<v Elisabetta Mori>were pushing about a quarter of
all the packets on the Internet

881
00:48:27.393 --> 00:48:27.954
<v Elisabetta Mori>worldwide.

882
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.764
<v Elisabetta Mori>And those packets were being fed

883
00:48:30.904 --> 00:48:34.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>out of my file system that I had
written 40 years ago.

884
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:39.770
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they needed, you know, the
usual tweaks that you need to keep

885
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>it current with the current disk
technology and so on.

886
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:47.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that was certainly the single
piece that I'm most well known

887
00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:47.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>for.

888
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>I also wrote a paper that is still

889
00:48:54.288 --> 00:48:59.275
<v Elisabetta Mori>one of the core papers that gets
cited in computer science classes

890
00:48:59.535 --> 00:49:01.518
<v Elisabetta Mori>about file system technology.

891
00:49:01.582 --> 00:49:03.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>It really was the basis and should

892
00:49:03.811 --> 00:49:04.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>have been my thesis.

893
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.324
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the department at that time

894
00:49:08.705 --> 00:49:13.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>still believed that theses had to
be theoretical and that, you know,

895
00:49:13.852 --> 00:49:17.116
<v Elisabetta Mori>just a practical thing like this
wouldn't qualify.

896
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>Ultimately, I mean, today, this
sort of system based degrees are,

897
00:49:26.212 --> 00:49:28.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>in fact, much more common than the
research ones.

898
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>But at the time, that was not
deemed suitable.

899
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:38.589
<v Elisabetta Mori>So my actual thesis is having to
do with register allocation and

900
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:43.456
<v Elisabetta Mori>table driven code generators,
which at the time was kind of

901
00:49:43.516 --> 00:49:43.937
<v Elisabetta Mori>pointless.

902
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.363
<v Elisabetta Mori>Although it turned out now that we

903
00:49:45.383 --> 00:49:50.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>have machines with many more
registers, it is actually had a

904
00:49:50.095 --> 00:49:50.536
<v Elisabetta Mori>revival.

905
00:49:50.536 --> 00:49:51.644
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so some of the stuff that

906
00:49:51.684 --> 00:49:54.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>I did at that time is actually
somewhat useful today.

907
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.769
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I would say that the file
system was certainly one of the

908
00:49:59.809 --> 00:50:02.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>very significant pieces of what I
did.

909
00:50:04.261 --> 00:50:11.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>At any rate, I, of course, was
still a student in 1982 and was

910
00:50:11.672 --> 00:50:15.157
<v Elisabetta Mori>still doing some stuff with Bill
in the BSD stuff.

911
00:50:15.921 --> 00:50:20.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he calls me into my office
one day and he says, I'm just in

912
00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:22.815
<v Elisabetta Mori>the midst of starting up this new
company.

913
00:50:24.381 --> 00:50:29.427
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we're going to build
workstations and it's going to be

914
00:50:29.467 --> 00:50:35.294
<v Elisabetta Mori>based on commodity hardware, the
Motorola 68000 series and

915
00:50:35.394 --> 00:50:37.697
<v Elisabetta Mori>commodity software, which is going
to be Unix.

916
00:50:38.561 --> 00:50:42.494
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, we're going to be
great.

917
00:50:42.494 --> 00:50:42.572
<v Elisabetta Mori>We're to be great.

918
00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:43.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>We're going to take over the

919
00:50:43.628 --> 00:50:43.809
<v Elisabetta Mori>world.

920
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:52.452
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I said, you know, Bill, you

921
00:50:52.472 --> 00:50:55.917
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, you're coming into a market
where, you know, that's all that's

922
00:50:55.957 --> 00:50:56.557
<v Elisabetta Mori>all nice.

923
00:50:56.761 --> 00:51:02.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>But what people actually care

924
00:51:02.632 --> 00:51:04.996
<v Elisabetta Mori>about is the applications that
they're running.

925
00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:12.888
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, there's Apollo has
this system where they, you know,

926
00:51:12.908 --> 00:51:16.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>they have a commodity or a
proprietary workstation,

927
00:51:16.752 --> 00:51:19.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>proprietary operating system, but
they run all the CAD CAM software

928
00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:21.357
<v Elisabetta Mori>and people want CAD CAM software.

929
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.843
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, that's a great idea

930
00:51:24.863 --> 00:51:29.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>that you have, but, you know, I
don't think that, you know, I

931
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.955
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't see that as, you know,
really having what it takes to,

932
00:51:34.076 --> 00:51:35.237
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, become big.

933
00:51:35.237 --> 00:51:36.825
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I said, yeah, but, you know,

934
00:51:36.845 --> 00:51:39.452
<v Elisabetta Mori>you'll be a single digit employee
of Sun, you know, and you'll get

935
00:51:39.472 --> 00:51:40.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>all this stock.

936
00:51:40.214 --> 00:51:41.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And I'm like, well, look,

937
00:51:41.706 --> 00:51:43.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>we'll see how that goes.

938
00:51:43.962 --> 00:51:46.931
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, I'm about a year

939
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>from finishing my PhD. And I know
that if I go off there, I won't

940
00:51:49.788 --> 00:51:50.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>finish it.

941
00:51:50.261 --> 00:51:51.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>I really do want to finish my PhD.

942
00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:58.715
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we'll just, I'll finish my
degree and we'll see how your Sun

943
00:51:58.755 --> 00:51:59.737
<v Elisabetta Mori>microsystem is doing.

944
00:51:59.737 --> 00:52:00.024
<v Elisabetta Mori>And is doing.

945
00:52:00.024 --> 00:52:01.630
<v Elisabetta Mori>And maybe that'd be the right time
for me to come.

946
00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:05.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>I said, well, all right, well,
will you at least be a consultant?

947
00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:08.888
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because Because we need the Pascal
compiler ported over and we need a

948
00:52:08.908 --> 00:52:11.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>little help with getting the Unix
ported to the Motorola.

949
00:52:12.422 --> 00:52:13.288
<v Elisabetta Mori>I said, OK, fine.

950
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.585
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I ended up getting a few

951
00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:20.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>thousand shares of Sun stock for
being their very first consultant,

952
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.708
<v Elisabetta Mori>which is just written out by Bill
Joy and signed by him and Vinod

953
00:52:23.748 --> 00:52:25.993
<v Elisabetta Mori>Khosla, who was the CEO of this
startup company.

954
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.866
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I tell people, you know, I
may have this degree in business,

955
00:52:31.987 --> 00:52:36.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>but, you know, perhaps you
shouldn't necessarily take my

956
00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>advice about these things.

957
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, of course, Sun was wildly

958
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.531
<v Elisabetta Mori>successful.

959
00:52:43.541 --> 00:52:45.425
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, even though I only

960
00:52:45.485 --> 00:52:48.552
<v Elisabetta Mori>had the 2000 shares, by the time
they went public, it was worth

961
00:52:48.612 --> 00:52:49.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>about a million dollars.

962
00:52:50.381 --> 00:52:52.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, I didn't bat badly

963
00:52:52.848 --> 00:52:53.269
<v Elisabetta Mori>out of that.

964
00:52:55.681 --> 00:52:59.189
<v Elisabetta Mori>At any rate, I, you know, took me

965
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.855
<v Elisabetta Mori>more like a year and a half to
finish my degree.

966
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>And by the time I finished my
degree, you know, Sun was already

967
00:53:05.409 --> 00:53:05.991
<v Elisabetta Mori>way out there.

968
00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:13.448
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so with Bill gone, they had

969
00:53:13.708 --> 00:53:18.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>brought in this other person, Mike
Carls, to sort of take the role of

970
00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.676
<v Elisabetta Mori>the technical lead there.

971
00:53:21.142 --> 00:53:24.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>But Mike was, I mean, his degree

972
00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:27.855
<v Elisabetta Mori>was in biology, I guess.

973
00:53:28.802 --> 00:53:31.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I mean, computing in biology.

974
00:53:32.783 --> 00:53:35.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>But he didn't really have a
computer science background.

975
00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.707
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I really felt that it was
important to have someone with a

976
00:53:37.767 --> 00:53:39.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>CS background around the group.

977
00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.907
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I ended up becoming essentially

978
00:53:44.628 --> 00:53:47.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>the academic in charge of the
group.

979
00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:52.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Mike and I sort of co-shared
that job.

980
00:53:52.781 --> 00:53:58.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>We also brought in Keith Bostick,
who had a degree in English, and

981
00:53:58.992 --> 00:54:01.577
<v Elisabetta Mori>Keith Sklauer, who had a degree in
music.

982
00:54:01.577 --> 00:54:05.390
<v Elisabetta Mori>So So I was the only one of the
four core people at CSRG that had

983
00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:06.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>computer science as a background.

984
00:54:08.162 --> 00:54:10.806
<v Elisabetta Mori>But in those days, you know, there

985
00:54:10.826 --> 00:54:13.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>were a lot of, we'll just say
self-taught people that, you know,

986
00:54:15.134 --> 00:54:15.996
<v Elisabetta Mori>that knew these things.

987
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.344
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, we had that

988
00:54:18.404 --> 00:54:24.016
<v Elisabetta Mori>group, and the four of us more or
less put together the BSDs that

989
00:54:24.056 --> 00:54:24.456
<v Elisabetta Mori>came out.

990
00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:26.446
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the real thing that made this

991
00:54:26.527 --> 00:54:29.375
<v Elisabetta Mori>possible, and it was really
something that Bill had set up,

992
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:33.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>and up, and that was bringing in
stuff from other people.

993
00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:38.431
<v Elisabetta Mori>And although it wasn't open source
at that point, everybody had to

994
00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:39.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>have Unix licenses.

995
00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.806
<v Elisabetta Mori>The Unix licenses initially had

996
00:54:41.846 --> 00:54:42.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>been like $99 for a university.

997
00:54:45.403 --> 00:54:47.127
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, eventually rose to,

998
00:54:47.147 --> 00:54:50.596
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, about $10,000 maybe for
a university.

999
00:54:50.642 --> 00:54:53.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>But all the universities just
basically had it, and they all had

1000
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:53.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>VAXs.

1001
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.666
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, there was lots of

1002
00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:56.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>sharing that was going on.

1003
00:54:57.762 --> 00:54:59.547
<v Elisabetta Mori>And companies could get licenses

1004
00:54:59.647 --> 00:55:02.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>for, at the time, about $40,000 or
$50,000.

1005
00:55:02.381 --> 00:55:06.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, again, that was something
that they could do.

1006
00:55:06.474 --> 00:55:06.541
<v Elisabetta Mori>So could do.

1007
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:09.229
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we had a lot of people who were

1008
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:11.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>using these things in companies
and in universities, and in

1009
00:55:11.732 --> 00:55:14.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>universities, and a lot of sharing
of the code going around.

1010
00:55:15.261 --> 00:55:21.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>And once we got up on the network
where you had the TCP IP

1011
00:55:21.611 --> 00:55:24.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>networking, it was possible for
people to log in and, you know,

1012
00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:25.317
<v Elisabetta Mori>interact.

1013
00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.486
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, in fact, we ended up

1014
00:55:29.728 --> 00:55:34.377
<v Elisabetta Mori>probably coordinating from about
400 people that were contributing.

1015
00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:38.711
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the way it actually worked was
we would have a designated person

1016
00:55:39.794 --> 00:55:40.395
<v Elisabetta Mori>at each site.

1017
00:55:40.395 --> 00:55:40.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>So site.

1018
00:55:40.712 --> 00:55:43.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the University of Utah, for
example, was a big contributor.

1019
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:47.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there was one or two people
there that had accounts on our

1020
00:55:47.993 --> 00:55:50.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>machine, so they could bring their
stuff over and check it in.

1021
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:56.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>Source code control was also
something that came about in

1022
00:55:56.289 --> 00:55:57.992
<v Elisabetta Mori>around 1979 or 1980, which we
started using at that point.

1023
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.275
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that allowed us to directly
let people check things in.

1024
00:56:05.441 --> 00:56:07.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>We could see who put it in, what
they put in.

1025
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:11.428
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, in fact, Bill would do this
thing where he would print out all

1026
00:56:11.488 --> 00:56:14.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>the changes that had been made
since the last distribution.

1027
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>We would literally go through line
by line and look at all those

1028
00:56:16.668 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>changes.

1029
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.803
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, different of us would look

1030
00:56:19.823 --> 00:56:25.111
<v Elisabetta Mori>at different parts, but that was
how we did our quality control

1031
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:27.716
<v Elisabetta Mori>stuff to get distributions out the
door.

1032
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:39.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, at any rate, ultimately, Mike
and Keith Bostic left and went off

1033
00:56:39.871 --> 00:56:47.562
<v Elisabetta Mori>to start VSDI, Berkeley Software
Distribution, Inc. And so at that

1034
00:56:47.622 --> 00:56:53.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>point, then I was the sole person
in charge of, truly in charge of

1035
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:56.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>the thing, as opposed to just sort
of co-doing it with these other

1036
00:56:56.155 --> 00:56:56.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>folks.

1037
00:56:57.461 --> 00:56:58.325
<v Kirk McKusick>What year was this?

1038
00:57:00.801 --> 00:57:07.273
<v Elisabetta Mori>That would have been after 4.2 and
before the, or maybe we got as far

1039
00:57:07.273 --> 00:57:10.136
<v Elisabetta Mori>as 4.3. I think we got as far as
4.3.

1040
00:57:10.422 --> 00:57:12.512
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, I basically took over after
that.

1041
00:57:12.621 --> 00:57:19.372
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, did five more distributions
after that or oversaw, directly

1042
00:57:19.432 --> 00:57:20.754
<v Elisabetta Mori>oversaw five more distributions.

1043
00:57:22.741 --> 00:57:27.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>The big thing was moving from this

1044
00:57:27.268 --> 00:57:30.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>thing where you had to have an
AT&T source license to one which

1045
00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:31.395
<v Elisabetta Mori>you did not.

1046
00:57:32.902 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that turned out to be more

1047
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.314
<v Elisabetta Mori>difficult than one might expect.

1048
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:43.611
<v Elisabetta Mori>The issue was we had written

1049
00:57:43.912 --> 00:57:45.135
<v Elisabetta Mori>ourselves TCP IP.

1050
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.064
<v Elisabetta Mori>The only networking that came from

1051
00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:52.374
<v Elisabetta Mori>Bell Labs was something called
UUCP, Unix to Unix copy, which was

1052
00:57:52.474 --> 00:57:53.557
<v Elisabetta Mori>a dial-up thing.

1053
00:57:53.621 --> 00:57:54.783
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so you would dial up, you'd

1054
00:57:55.024 --> 00:57:57.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>batch stuff together and then
you'd dial up and push it across

1055
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>to the other side and then it
would be distributed on the other

1056
00:58:00.555 --> 00:58:00.815
<v Elisabetta Mori>side.

1057
00:58:01.761 --> 00:58:03.103
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, this concept of direct

1058
00:58:03.183 --> 00:58:07.790
<v Elisabetta Mori>networking TCP IP was entirely
stuff that had been done at

1059
00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:11.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley or by the contributors to
Berkeley, like BBNN.

1060
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:21.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, there were a number of
companies that wanted to build TCP

1061
00:58:21.493 --> 00:58:23.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>IP for the IBM PC.

1062
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.945
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the IBM PC, of course, that

1063
00:58:25.985 --> 00:58:28.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>was proprietary Microsoft
software.

1064
00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.125
<v Elisabetta Mori>But what they wanted was a card
that you could plug into the side

1065
00:58:33.145 --> 00:58:39.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>that would just look like a port
to Windows, but would run the

1066
00:58:39.053 --> 00:58:41.516
<v Elisabetta Mori>whole TCP IP networking on that
board.

1067
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, it would do all the
chit-chat that was needed.

1068
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>And for that, they needed the TCP
IP software to put on their board.

1069
00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they wanted to get that from
Berkeley.

1070
00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:56.572
<v Elisabetta Mori>By this time, AT&T had raised the
price of getting a Swiss license

1071
00:58:56.692 --> 00:58:58.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>to a quarter million dollars.

1072
00:58:59.005 --> 00:59:00.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was for one machine.

1073
00:59:00.722 --> 00:59:03.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, if you had like two machines,
it was a half a million dollars,

1074
00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:06.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>etc. So, and these little
companies that just wanted to

1075
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:08.315
<v Elisabetta Mori>build boards didn't have that kind
of money.

1076
00:59:09.143 --> 00:59:12.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, they came to us and said,
well, you know, you wrote TCP IP.

1077
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:17.291
<v Elisabetta Mori>Can't you release that to us as,
you know, under just a Berkeley

1078
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:22.368
<v Elisabetta Mori>license and not an AT&T license?
And so, we went through and we

1079
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.496
<v Elisabetta Mori>picked out all of that networking
software.

1080
00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:25.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, software.

1081
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:27.263
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, there was the TCP IP code

1082
00:59:27.303 --> 00:59:32.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>itself and the device drivers for
it and the utilities like Telnet

1083
00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:38.137
<v Elisabetta Mori>and SMTP, the electronic mail, and
all of those things.

1084
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we packaged that together and
we called it the Networking

1085
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.264
<v Elisabetta Mori>Release 1.

1086
00:59:43.962 --> 00:59:45.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we went to the Berkeley

1087
00:59:45.525 --> 00:59:49.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>lawyers and said, you know, we
want to do this as a release from

1088
00:59:49.173 --> 00:59:49.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley.

1089
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.082
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we want to, you know, have

1090
00:59:52.486 --> 00:59:55.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>people be able to freely give it
away and do whatever they want

1091
00:59:55.112 --> 00:59:55.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>with it.

1092
00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:58.124
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the lawyers came back with

1093
00:59:58.144 --> 01:00:01.913
<v Elisabetta Mori>this like 20-page thing that we
were going to have to put at the

1094
01:00:01.953 --> 01:00:03.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>top of every single file.

1095
01:00:03.155 --> 01:00:04.526
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And we're like, no, no, no,

1096
01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.966
<v Elisabetta Mori>no, no, no, no, no, no. You do not
understand.

1097
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:07.984
<v Elisabetta Mori>We're not doing this.

1098
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.261
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we finally got it distilled

1099
01:00:10.321 --> 01:00:15.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>down to what is called the BSD
license, which is sort of half a

1100
01:00:15.728 --> 01:00:21.797
<v Elisabetta Mori>page, the well-known, you know,
open source document.

1101
01:00:22.682 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, we went and we put that
into the top.

1102
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:29.817
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, we would sell these
networking one tapes for $1,000.

1103
01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we figured we'd sell like
three, you know.

1104
01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.908
<v Elisabetta Mori>UUNet would buy one and would put
it up and everyone would just

1105
01:00:35.968 --> 01:00:36.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>download it from them.

1106
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.183
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it turned out that all these

1107
01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>little companies were more than
happy to spend $1,000 to get a

1108
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.714
<v Elisabetta Mori>piece of paper from the university
that said, this is open source

1109
01:00:47.755 --> 01:00:49.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>software and you can do whatever
you want with it.

1110
01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:51.309
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we sold about 1,000 of those
tapes.

1111
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:58.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, that provided us
like a million dollars just right

1112
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.656
<v Elisabetta Mori>off the top that we could then
continue doing stuff with.

1113
01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:11.794
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the upshot of that was that
Keith Bostic was like, well, you

1114
01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.056
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, this has been so successful.

1115
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.447
<v Elisabetta Mori>But now, people want, you know,

1116
01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:14.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>more.

1117
01:01:15.341 --> 01:01:16.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they want the rest of

1118
01:01:16.726 --> 01:01:17.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>all the stuff that we've done.

1119
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.622
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we're like, you know, Keith,

1120
01:01:21.605 --> 01:01:25.691
<v Elisabetta Mori>first of all, you know, there's
the utilities and, you know, we're

1121
01:01:26.232 --> 01:01:29.077
<v Elisabetta Mori>not clear which of the, you know,
LS and other things like that.

1122
01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:30.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they came from AT&T.

1123
01:01:30.663 --> 01:01:31.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, we can't really

1124
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:32.592
<v Elisabetta Mori>release those.

1125
01:01:32.592 --> 01:01:32.671
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you those.

1126
01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:36.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, and there's all the
stuff in the C library that came

1127
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.796
<v Elisabetta Mori>from the original Unix and blah,
blah, blah.

1128
01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.629
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, if you can figure
out some way of dealing with that,

1129
01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:44.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, then somehow we'll see
what we can do with the kernel.

1130
01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:46.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>And knowing full well that he
wasn't going to be able to do it.

1131
01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:47.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that would be the end of that.

1132
01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:47.154
<v Elisabetta Mori>wasn't going to be able to do it.

1133
01:01:47.154 --> 01:01:47.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, that would be the end of that.

1134
01:01:49.384 --> 01:01:51.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>But he, we started going to these

1135
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.294
<v Elisabetta Mori>USENIC conferences.

1136
01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:54.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, we had been going to them

1137
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:54.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>for a long time.

1138
01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:54.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>And a long time.

1139
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:59.291
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there was always these things
called bird of feather, which was

1140
01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:01.877
<v Elisabetta Mori>where you would just have some
topic that you would talk about.

1141
01:02:02.002 --> 01:02:05.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we would always do a bird of a
feather on what was going on at

1142
01:02:05.551 --> 01:02:07.456
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley with Berkeley Unix.

1143
01:02:08.221 --> 01:02:09.362
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, we get up at this and

1144
01:02:09.402 --> 01:02:15.472
<v Elisabetta Mori>Keith gets up and he puts up a
slide that's a list of, you know,

1145
01:02:15.472 --> 01:02:21.275
<v Elisabetta Mori>100 some utilities and libraries
and says, you know, we are trying

1146
01:02:21.335 --> 01:02:23.758
<v Elisabetta Mori>to get, you know, a complete free
distribution.

1147
01:02:23.863 --> 01:02:26.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>We need all of these programs
rewritten.

1148
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:32.348
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, so, you know, I'm
inviting all of you and take to go

1149
01:02:32.468 --> 01:02:35.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>out and do these and send them to
us, you know, and, you know, we'll

1150
01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:38.997
<v Elisabetta Mori>give you credit for having written
them and blah, blah, blah.

1151
01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:43.011
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, so some of the easy
things like LS is not a hard

1152
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:43.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>program to write.

1153
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, someone writes that

1154
01:02:45.725 --> 01:02:48.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>and someone writes some of the
other easy ones.

1155
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:53.009
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then at some point, things
like the TROC comes in, you know,

1156
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:56.555
<v Elisabetta Mori>someone's rewritten this entire
text processing system, which is

1157
01:02:56.695 --> 01:02:57.617
<v Elisabetta Mori>huge and complex.

1158
01:02:57.782 --> 01:02:59.808
<v Elisabetta Mori>And people start sending in some

1159
01:02:59.828 --> 01:03:02.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>of the more significant pieces of
the libraries.

1160
01:03:02.515 --> 01:03:05.028
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, And, you know, at some point,
Keith comes in and said, well,

1161
01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:07.194
<v Elisabetta Mori>I've got about 80% of this stuff
done.

1162
01:03:07.221 --> 01:03:10.504
<v Elisabetta Mori>How's that kernel going, guys?
I look at Mike and Mike looks at

1163
01:03:10.544 --> 01:03:13.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>me and we're like, how are we
going to deal with this?

1164
01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>Because, of course, you know,
there's the way you write code is

1165
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.216
<v Elisabetta Mori>you grab snippets of things from
one place and drop them in another

1166
01:03:23.276 --> 01:03:23.617
<v Elisabetta Mori>place.

1167
01:03:23.617 --> 01:03:25.448
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so, you know, there's just

1168
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>this whole mishmash of stuff.

1169
01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you can't just sort of rewrite

1170
01:03:29.188 --> 01:03:30.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>the kernel from scratch.

1171
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:34.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>So Keith finally comes up with

1172
01:03:34.184 --> 01:03:41.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>this idea of going through and
building a database where each

1173
01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:46.977
<v Elisabetta Mori>line of code in our kernel is an
element that you can look up.

1174
01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:51.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then going and getting the
original Unix from which we had

1175
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.376
<v Elisabetta Mori>started and doing the same thing
with that and then doing matches.

1176
01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:59.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And any place you get a run of
four more lines of code, you sort

1177
01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:00.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>of look at it and see.

1178
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.384
<v Elisabetta Mori>And sure enough, you know, you can

1179
01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>see, oh, they cut this and put it
over there.

1180
01:04:05.481 --> 01:04:08.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>And a lot of these things were
just stupid stuff.

1181
01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.432
<v Elisabetta Mori>Like you would do a link of a look
through a table.

1182
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.028
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we would just change it to,
you know, be a linked list instead

1183
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:19.674
<v Elisabetta Mori>of an array or something like
that.

1184
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>Enough to change it so that it was
different.

1185
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.785
<v Elisabetta Mori>The code was different.

1186
01:04:23.503 --> 01:04:24.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we go through.

1187
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>And before long, we're down to the
point where there's only about six

1188
01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:31.236
<v Elisabetta Mori>files left that have any of the
original code left in it.

1189
01:04:32.162 --> 01:04:36.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's really only going to be a
few month project to get those

1190
01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:37.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>last six rewritten.

1191
01:04:38.122 --> 01:04:39.406
<v Elisabetta Mori>But we decide, you know, that

1192
01:04:39.446 --> 01:04:43.115
<v Elisabetta Mori>would be kind of pulling the chain
of AT&T a little bit too much.

1193
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:46.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>So if we release something and
say, well, it's not a complete

1194
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>kernel.

1195
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.144
<v Elisabetta Mori>There's some parts that are

1196
01:04:48.204 --> 01:04:50.333
<v Elisabetta Mori>missing because they were
proprietary.

1197
01:04:50.802 --> 01:04:53.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>Then they won't mind and they will
just let it go.

1198
01:04:54.381 --> 01:04:55.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we put together.

1199
01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then we don't want to have the

1200
01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:01.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>lawyers go through too much more
hoo-for-rah.

1201
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.388
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we just say, well, we're
just going to present this to them

1202
01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:07.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>as an update to the networking
tape.

1203
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.729
<v Elisabetta Mori>So this is going to be networking
release two tape.

1204
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they are like, whoa, how much
has changed?

1205
01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like, oh, well, it's got
about 2,000% more lines of code in

1206
01:05:21.391 --> 01:05:22.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>it than the previous one did.

1207
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.683
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they're like, well, where did

1208
01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:26.447
<v Elisabetta Mori>all this code come from?
So we sort of fess up to what we'd

1209
01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:26.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>done.

1210
01:05:27.741 --> 01:05:30.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they insisted on having us

1211
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:32.754
<v Elisabetta Mori>bring in an outside expert.

1212
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.328
<v Elisabetta Mori>They designated him.

1213
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:37.471
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this person came in and did
an audit of all of our changes.

1214
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.847
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it did, in fact, find some
things we'd missed.

1215
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.231
<v Elisabetta Mori>But once we got a call from this
auditor, the university says, OK,

1216
01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:47.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>fine, go ahead, do it.

1217
01:05:48.801 --> 01:05:51.326
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so out goes networking release

1218
01:05:51.366 --> 01:05:54.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>two, which is pretty much the
whole system with this same

1219
01:05:54.252 --> 01:05:56.196
<v Elisabetta Mori>license that says you can do what
you want with it.

1220
01:05:57.102 --> 01:06:00.408
<v Elisabetta Mori>And sure enough, another thousand
people pay the thousand dollars to

1221
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>get this piece of paper that says
it's OK.

1222
01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:07.746
<v Elisabetta Mori>One of which, of course, is
Berkeley Software Design, Inc.,

1223
01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:13.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>because they can now start
releasing a Unix system.

1224
01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:18.894
<v Elisabetta Mori>And unfortunately, they were a
little bit aggressive in some of

1225
01:06:18.954 --> 01:06:19.616
<v Elisabetta Mori>their marketing.

1226
01:06:19.761 --> 01:06:22.669
<v Elisabetta Mori>So they got their phone number was

1227
01:06:22.689 --> 01:06:23.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>1-800-ITS-UNIX.

1228
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.285
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they ran these ads saying, you

1229
01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:33.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, all the same features as the
System 5 release, whatever, at 99%

1230
01:06:33.608 --> 01:06:34.009
<v Elisabetta Mori>off on the price.

1231
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.244
<v Elisabetta Mori>So instead of being half a million

1232
01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:49.233
<v Elisabetta Mori>dollars, it's, I don't know,
$20,000 or whatever the heck it

1233
01:06:49.253 --> 01:06:49.414
<v Elisabetta Mori>was.

1234
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.727
<v Elisabetta Mori>So anyway, AT&T saw this and they

1235
01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:59.046
<v Elisabetta Mori>were like, ah!
And so the upshot is that they

1236
01:06:59.106 --> 01:07:04.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>sued BSDI and said, you know,
you're releasing our proprietary

1237
01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:04.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>stuff.

1238
01:07:05.841 --> 01:07:07.704
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so here you have a little

1239
01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:13.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>startup of, you know, eight or 10
people versus, you know, the AT&T

1240
01:07:13.372 --> 01:07:14.434
<v Elisabetta Mori>monolith of lawyers.

1241
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.105
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they, you know, they had this

1242
01:07:18.145 --> 01:07:21.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>piece of paper that said, hey, you
know, this is, you know, free and

1243
01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:22.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>available software.

1244
01:07:22.923 --> 01:07:25.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>And all we've done is add these

1245
01:07:25.311 --> 01:07:26.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>six files, you know.

1246
01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.808
<v Elisabetta Mori>So they go into the courtroom and

1247
01:07:28.848 --> 01:07:30.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>they say, you know, all we've
done.

1248
01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:31.924
<v Elisabetta Mori>This is free.

1249
01:07:32.025 --> 01:07:32.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>It says so right here.

1250
01:07:33.562 --> 01:07:35.751
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, if you don't like it,
talk to the University of

1251
01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:36.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>California.

1252
01:07:36.702 --> 01:07:37.807
<v Elisabetta Mori>We added these six files.

1253
01:07:37.847 --> 01:07:39.694
<v Elisabetta Mori>Which of these six files do you
have a problem with?

1254
01:07:39.694 --> 01:07:40.726
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, they a problem with?
Well, they didn't have any problem

1255
01:07:40.746 --> 01:07:42.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>because these had been written
from scratch.

1256
01:07:42.493 --> 01:07:42.831
<v Elisabetta Mori>So scratch.

1257
01:07:42.831 --> 01:07:46.409
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the judge basically told AT&T,

1258
01:07:47.592 --> 01:07:49.536
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, you have no standing.

1259
01:07:49.582 --> 01:07:51.452
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, you have no complaint on

1260
01:07:51.472 --> 01:07:51.633
<v Elisabetta Mori>this.

1261
01:07:51.803 --> 01:07:54.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, they've got this

1262
01:07:54.373 --> 01:07:54.775
<v Elisabetta Mori>document.

1263
01:07:54.775 --> 01:07:54.822
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I'm going this document.

1264
01:07:54.822 --> 01:07:56.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I'm going to throw the case
out.

1265
01:07:59.124 --> 01:08:02.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so AT&T went, oh!
So they sued the University of

1266
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:03.552
<v Elisabetta Mori>California.

1267
01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:05.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, now we have, you know,

1268
01:08:05.366 --> 01:08:08.415
<v Elisabetta Mori>immovable object versus large
movable object.

1269
01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:13.450
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, of course, the university
immediately stopped the

1270
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:14.873
<v Elisabetta Mori>distribution of NET2.

1271
01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:17.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, I mean, it's out there.

1272
01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:20.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>So it didn't really stop much of
anything.

1273
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then the university, you know,
comes around and it's like, you

1274
01:08:25.812 --> 01:08:28.042
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, what's going on here?
And I said, well, we told you, you

1275
01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:30.551
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, remember, we did this review
and blah, blah, blah.

1276
01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:32.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they're like, oh, yeah, right.

1277
01:08:37.786 --> 01:08:40.091
<v Elisabetta Mori>The university lawyers themselves

1278
01:08:40.432 --> 01:08:42.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>really deal with writing
contracts.

1279
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>They don't deal with resolving
issues.

1280
01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:47.328
<v Elisabetta Mori>That's a different sort of area of
law.

1281
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:52.947
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they ended up having to
hire this other group, this other

1282
01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:56.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>law firm, to come in and actually
do this, this piece of it,

1283
01:08:58.955 --> 01:08:59.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>contesting with AT&T.

1284
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.805
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they, you know, the university

1285
01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:03.852
<v Elisabetta Mori>doesn't want to, there was no
money in it for them.

1286
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.988
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, they weren't
really going to, that eager to

1287
01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>spend a lot of money to try and
deal with it.

1288
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.143
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they figured, all right, well,
we'll, you know, at least get the

1289
01:09:12.183 --> 01:09:14.687
<v Elisabetta Mori>framework of it, you know, because
we're saying like, look, you know,

1290
01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:18.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>this is so important for the world
and blah, blah, blah, you know,

1291
01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.395
<v Elisabetta Mori>like what you would say.

1292
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.884
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so anyway, we're in this, the

1293
01:09:23.904 --> 01:09:29.852
<v Elisabetta Mori>way these things work is you have
depositions where, you know, the

1294
01:09:29.892 --> 01:09:32.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>facts get gathered before you go
to trial.

1295
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.970
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so normally you would hire an
expert.

1296
01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.979
<v Elisabetta Mori>But of course, the university
doesn't have the money to pay the

1297
01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:39.687
<v Elisabetta Mori>$500 an hour that experts get.

1298
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.144
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I got to be the expert

1299
01:09:44.404 --> 01:09:49.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>about this stuff because I was
already an employee.

1300
01:09:49.336 --> 01:09:50.688
<v Elisabetta Mori>So So they were just paying my
salary.

1301
01:09:51.701 --> 01:09:57.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course, lawyers never want
to use an expert that hasn't been

1302
01:09:57.849 --> 01:10:00.814
<v Elisabetta Mori>an expert before because, well,
you know, they don't know how well

1303
01:10:00.854 --> 01:10:01.815
<v Elisabetta Mori>this person is going to do.

1304
01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.484
<v Elisabetta Mori>It turns out, actually, there's

1305
01:10:04.644 --> 01:10:08.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of the three most important
things to be an expert.

1306
01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:11.750
<v Elisabetta Mori>The first one is that you have a
Ph.D. because if you have a Ph.D.,

1307
01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:12.954
<v Elisabetta Mori>you must know what you're talking
about.

1308
01:10:13.281 --> 01:10:14.045
<v Elisabetta Mori>Don't laugh to court.

1309
01:10:15.422 --> 01:10:15.884
<v Elisabetta Mori>So check.

1310
01:10:15.944 --> 01:10:16.427
<v Elisabetta Mori>I have that.

1311
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:20.527
<v Elisabetta Mori>The second one is that you have to

1312
01:10:20.567 --> 01:10:24.334
<v Elisabetta Mori>be really good at public speaking
and not being flustered.

1313
01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:28.169
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, I mean, at this
point, I've had about 10,000

1314
01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:29.334
<v Elisabetta Mori>students in my career.

1315
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:30.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>But even at that point, I'd had

1316
01:10:30.847 --> 01:10:32.694
<v Elisabetta Mori>quite a few that I'd worked with.

1317
01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:32.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you I'd worked with.

1318
01:10:32.951 --> 01:10:36.028
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, graduate students
are some of the toughest people

1319
01:10:36.048 --> 01:10:38.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>you're ever going to have because
they're trying to prove that they

1320
01:10:38.252 --> 01:10:39.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>know more than you do about
something.

1321
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.407
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I, you know, a lawyer
doesn't stand a chance compared to

1322
01:10:44.487 --> 01:10:49.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>a graduate Ph.D. student trying to
argue with me about this

1323
01:10:49.075 --> 01:10:49.696
<v Elisabetta Mori>technology.

1324
01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:51.586
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then third is what you

1325
01:10:51.807 --> 01:10:53.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually the facts that you know.

1326
01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:57.069
<v Elisabetta Mori>But there you have a whole set of

1327
01:10:57.109 --> 01:10:59.273
<v Elisabetta Mori>people that are working with you
to, you know, gather the

1328
01:10:59.314 --> 01:10:59.775
<v Elisabetta Mori>information.

1329
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.862
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you just want to say, I need

1330
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.488
<v Elisabetta Mori>this and someone will go find it
for you.

1331
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:06.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>I often describe being an expert.

1332
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.423
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's kind of like being the

1333
01:11:08.523 --> 01:11:11.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>newscaster, you know, and the
newscaster is just, you know,

1334
01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:15.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>reading off a teleprompter of, you
know, some news story that's been

1335
01:11:15.514 --> 01:11:16.375
<v Elisabetta Mori>put together for them.

1336
01:11:17.562 --> 01:11:18.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's not quite that easy.

1337
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the point is that, you know,
there's a lot of infrastructure

1338
01:11:23.773 --> 01:11:24.375
<v Elisabetta Mori>around you to help.

1339
01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:26.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>So deposition.

1340
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:29.771
<v Elisabetta Mori>And these days, depositions are
really tightly scripted.

1341
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>And but in those days, it could
just go on for more or less

1342
01:11:35.132 --> 01:11:36.195
<v Elisabetta Mori>indefinite period of time.

1343
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.843
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this one, I think it went

1344
01:11:37.903 --> 01:11:43.675
<v Elisabetta Mori>on for three days, eight hours a
day for three days.

1345
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:53.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they had AT&T had hired this
New York lawyer who was like one

1346
01:11:53.374 --> 01:11:55.758
<v Elisabetta Mori>of the top 10 people for taking
depositions.

1347
01:11:55.758 --> 01:11:55.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, depositions.

1348
01:11:55.788 --> 01:11:56.983
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, he was just one of these

1349
01:11:57.003 --> 01:12:01.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>people that could just absolutely
drill down, you know, alternately,

1350
01:12:01.632 --> 01:12:04.577
<v Elisabetta Mori>like trying to be your best friend
and sort of get your confidence.

1351
01:12:04.577 --> 01:12:07.152
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And then suddenly turning on
you and stabbing you.

1352
01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:10.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, just it was an
interesting experience.

1353
01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:14.907
<v Elisabetta Mori>The lawyer that was prepping me
for it said, think of it as like a

1354
01:12:14.987 --> 01:12:16.831
<v Elisabetta Mori>proctate exam from Captain Hook.

1355
01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.291
<v Elisabetta Mori>Anyway, so we get in there.

1356
01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:24.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the thing about a deposition
is they ask you a question.

1357
01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:30.573
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then your lawyer can basically
say, well, that's not a reasonable

1358
01:12:30.593 --> 01:12:30.894
<v Elisabetta Mori>question.

1359
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.644
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's not phrased properly or it's,

1360
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.773
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, vague or, you know,
whatever.

1361
01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:39.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so then there's a debate that
goes between them as to the

1362
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:40.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>relevance of the question.

1363
01:12:41.561 --> 01:12:42.864
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then after that, you have to

1364
01:12:42.964 --> 01:12:46.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>answer it because the judge will
ultimately decide whether the

1365
01:12:46.513 --> 01:12:47.556
<v Elisabetta Mori>question could have been asked.

1366
01:12:47.556 --> 01:12:48.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And if the judge decides it

1367
01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:50.132
<v Elisabetta Mori>couldn't have been asked, then
they can't use it.

1368
01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>But if he decides it can, you
don't know that because the judge

1369
01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:53.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>isn't there.

1370
01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.630
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the big debate happens and then

1371
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.054
<v Elisabetta Mori>you answer the question.

1372
01:12:59.301 --> 01:13:01.409
<v Elisabetta Mori>On my case, I had not one but two

1373
01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:01.771
<v Elisabetta Mori>lawyers.

1374
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.506
<v Elisabetta Mori>So on one side of me is sitting

1375
01:13:03.586 --> 01:13:04.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>the lawyer for BSDI.

1376
01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>And on the other side is sitting

1377
01:13:06.765 --> 01:13:09.452
<v Elisabetta Mori>the lawyer for the University of
California at Berkeley.

1378
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this guy's been, you know,
going back and forth with me and

1379
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:14.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>finally asked a question.

1380
01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the BSDI lawyer, you know,

1381
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:17.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>blah, blah, blah.

1382
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.246
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they argue about it and

1383
01:13:19.286 --> 01:13:19.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>arguing about it.

1384
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.506
<v Elisabetta Mori>Finally, you know, he goes, you

1385
01:13:22.526 --> 01:13:25.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, all right, now you have to
answer the question.

1386
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I, you know, one of the little
tricks you play is say, well, I

1387
01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:30.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't really remember the
question.

1388
01:13:31.522 --> 01:13:34.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>And what they should do is ask it
to be read back.

1389
01:13:34.293 --> 01:13:34.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>But back.

1390
01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:34.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they didn't.

1391
01:13:35.241 --> 01:13:35.583
<v Elisabetta Mori>He didn't.

1392
01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>He just asked it again in a

1393
01:13:37.306 --> 01:13:37.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>different way.

1394
01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:39.765
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the other lawyer, blah, blah,

1395
01:13:39.785 --> 01:13:41.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you
know.

1396
01:13:42.301 --> 01:13:44.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, they go on.

1397
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.469
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, then some agreement

1398
01:13:51.489 --> 01:13:54.995
<v Elisabetta Mori>that they come to and the BSDI
lawyer jumps in on that and

1399
01:13:55.035 --> 01:13:55.576
<v Elisabetta Mori>doesn't like that.

1400
01:13:56.421 --> 01:13:58.887
<v Elisabetta Mori>And this guy who's like this top

1401
01:13:59.288 --> 01:14:01.573
<v Elisabetta Mori>interrogator loses his cool.

1402
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he says, ladies, let him

1403
01:14:04.086 --> 01:14:05.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>answer the question.

1404
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.784
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, I can tell you that the BSD

1405
01:14:07.884 --> 01:14:12.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>or the Berkeley lawyer did not
like being referred to as a lady.

1406
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>I just saw this going.

1407
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.503
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I knew at that point the

1408
01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:19.170
<v Elisabetta Mori>university was going to fight this
to the end.

1409
01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.603
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they did.

1410
01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.405
<v Elisabetta Mori>So at any rate, what ends up

1411
01:14:27.445 --> 01:14:33.332
<v Elisabetta Mori>happening is that AT&T is supposed
to say, well, you know, you have

1412
01:14:33.372 --> 01:14:37.257
<v Elisabetta Mori>to say what it is that you think
that we're infringing on.

1413
01:14:37.321 --> 01:14:39.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they would just say,
well, it's in there.

1414
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they wouldn't say what
it was.

1415
01:14:41.901 --> 01:14:46.728
<v Elisabetta Mori>And eventually the ruling from the
judge came down and said, look, if

1416
01:14:46.768 --> 01:14:52.175
<v Elisabetta Mori>you don't say what you think is
the conflicting code, then you

1417
01:14:52.216 --> 01:14:52.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't have a case.

1418
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, you say what it is.

1419
01:14:56.642 --> 01:14:58.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they eventually put it out.

1420
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>And what they put out is that it's

1421
01:15:00.665 --> 01:15:02.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>the TCP IP code.

1422
01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>And what had happened, it turned

1423
01:15:04.982 --> 01:15:10.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>out, was that some years earlier
they had taken the TCP IP code

1424
01:15:10.188 --> 01:15:16.556
<v Elisabetta Mori>from Berkeley Unix and put it into
System 5, which they were allowed

1425
01:15:16.576 --> 01:15:16.737
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do.

1426
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, that's, you know, open

1427
01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:19.650
<v Elisabetta Mori>source works that way.

1428
01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:22.907
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the one thing they were not

1429
01:15:22.947 --> 01:15:25.413
<v Elisabetta Mori>allowed to do was remove the
copyright notices.

1430
01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:27.688
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they had.

1431
01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:30.888
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what had happened was that

1432
01:15:30.928 --> 01:15:33.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>they, the people that had done
that were gone.

1433
01:15:33.781 --> 01:15:37.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the people that were there
compared their TCP IP code with

1434
01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:41.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>ours and said, oh, well, they've
copied our TCP IP code, not

1435
01:15:41.073 --> 01:15:42.716
<v Elisabetta Mori>realizing how it had gotten it.

1436
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.224
<v Elisabetta Mori>And as soon as we figured, oh,

1437
01:15:47.065 --> 01:15:52.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>ding, you know, what they had done
was the one thing they weren't

1438
01:15:52.993 --> 01:15:55.576
<v Elisabetta Mori>allowed to do by the copyright,
which is remove the copyright.

1439
01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:03.928
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the University of
California runs out and files a

1440
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:11.456
<v Elisabetta Mori>counterclaim in the California
courts saying, you know, they have

1441
01:16:11.476 --> 01:16:12.737
<v Elisabetta Mori>violated our copyright.

1442
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.885
<v Elisabetta Mori>We want them to recall all of

1443
01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>their distributions and put the
appropriate notices in there.

1444
01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.968
<v Elisabetta Mori>We want them to recall all of
their printed documentation and

1445
01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:22.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>release them with the appropriate
credits.

1446
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.726
<v Elisabetta Mori>We want an ad in The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times and

1447
01:16:26.746 --> 01:16:31.073
<v Elisabetta Mori>The Washington Post apologizing
for this grievous, you know, lack

1448
01:16:31.133 --> 01:16:33.176
<v Elisabetta Mori>of whatever that they've done.

1449
01:16:34.103 --> 01:16:36.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>And boom, that was it.

1450
01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:37.153
<v Elisabetta Mori>Settlement started.

1451
01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:39.727
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in the end, we agreed to,

1452
01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:42.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>well, there wasn't really nothing
that we needed to remove.

1453
01:16:42.601 --> 01:16:45.446
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the lawyers, you know, at some
point take me out of the room and

1454
01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:49.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>say, look, just find three files
and just say, you know, we'll take

1455
01:16:49.915 --> 01:16:50.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>those out.

1456
01:16:50.682 --> 01:16:53.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, just make them happy.

1457
01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:59.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so there was this stuff we had
that was make it compatible with

1458
01:16:59.654 --> 01:17:00.254
<v Elisabetta Mori>System 5.

1459
01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:01.865
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we removed those three

1460
01:17:01.905 --> 01:17:04.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>things because I'd never liked
those stupid things anyway.

1461
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:11.195
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so then we re-released with
these changes made.

1462
01:17:11.195 --> 01:17:16.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And then we also had to say,
all right, we agree that anyone

1463
01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:21.695
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was using Net2 can't use it
anymore, but they can replace it

1464
01:17:21.755 --> 01:17:22.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>with this.

1465
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:25.685
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the thought was that there had

1466
01:17:25.705 --> 01:17:27.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>been by that time there were a
number of distributions out there

1467
01:17:27.949 --> 01:17:30.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>like FreeBSD and OpenBSD and
NetBSD.

1468
01:17:32.102 --> 01:17:36.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they figured, well, you
know, that's going to cost them,

1469
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, a year where they aren't
going to be able to do anything.

1470
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>But in fact, they managed to turn
that around in a couple of months.

1471
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it was actually beneficial to
us because we'd done more

1472
01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:46.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>development over another three
years.

1473
01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:48.847
<v Elisabetta Mori>So all that development we'd done
over the three years, you know,

1474
01:17:49.147 --> 01:17:51.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>got sort of pushed out as well.

1475
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:54.366
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I wasn't entirely sorry that

1476
01:17:54.386 --> 01:17:56.031
<v Elisabetta Mori>they were required to do that.

1477
01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:01.390
<v Elisabetta Mori>But that's the story of how we got

1478
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>to the open source.

1479
01:18:07.443 --> 01:18:07.683
<v Kirk McKusick>Yes.

1480
01:18:09.246 --> 01:18:16.055
<v Kirk McKusick>So what year are we now?
Like when everything is settled up

1481
01:18:16.195 --> 01:18:21.672
<v Kirk McKusick>with AT&T?
Where are we at this point, you

1482
01:18:21.692 --> 01:18:22.883
<v Elisabetta Mori>say?
Yes.

1483
01:18:23.064 --> 01:18:23.706
<v Kirk McKusick>What year?
What year?

1484
01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:29.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>Oh, that would have been 1992, I
think, or late 92 or early 93.

1485
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:32.741
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

1486
01:18:33.662 --> 01:18:36.467
<v Elisabetta Mori>So what happens in your life that

1487
01:18:36.547 --> 01:18:41.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>then you are involved in the
FreeBSD project, right?

1488
01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:42.641
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

1489
01:18:43.142 --> 01:18:46.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the story here, first of all,

1490
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:49.839
<v Elisabetta Mori>Linux had just started in 1990.

1491
01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.064
<v Elisabetta Mori>In fact, I heard the very first

1492
01:18:53.906 --> 01:18:57.654
<v Elisabetta Mori>talk, I believe, that Linus ever
gave about Linux.

1493
01:18:59.062 --> 01:19:03.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>And at that time, of course, we
were embroiled in the lawsuit.

1494
01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.649
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I said to him, look, you know,
why start a new operating system

1495
01:19:08.909 --> 01:19:11.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>when we have this that, you know,
you could just work from?

1496
01:19:12.301 --> 01:19:14.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he said, well, I'm not
convinced that you're going to win

1497
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:15.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>the lawsuit.

1498
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.122
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I don't want to put a whole

1499
01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:19.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>lot of time into something only to
have it, you know, thrown in the

1500
01:19:19.248 --> 01:19:21.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>trash can because of the lawsuit
outcome.

1501
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:28.128
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so if that lawsuit hadn't been
happening, I suspect that Linus

1502
01:19:28.168 --> 01:19:32.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>Torvalds would be involved with
BSD and Linux would.

1503
01:19:33.582 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>BSD would have the position that
Linux has today.

1504
01:19:36.661 --> 01:19:40.548
<v Elisabetta Mori>But because of that roughly four
year head start that they got,

1505
01:19:40.668 --> 01:19:42.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>they, you know, they got the mind
share.

1506
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:52.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>But at any rate, when we did the
Net2 release, the first one, which

1507
01:19:52.933 --> 01:19:56.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>had the six missing files, a
person named Bill Jolitz

1508
01:19:57.743 --> 01:20:03.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>essentially wrote those six files
and released something called BSD

1509
01:20:03.155 --> 01:20:03.455
<v Elisabetta Mori>386.

1510
01:20:11.365 --> 01:20:15.536
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he put that out.

1511
01:20:15.536 --> 01:20:15.672
<v Elisabetta Mori>And out.

1512
01:20:15.672 --> 01:20:16.505
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there were a lot of people

1513
01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:18.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>that were very interested in that
and started downloading it.

1514
01:20:19.522 --> 01:20:22.413
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they start, of course,
anything like that, you have bugs

1515
01:20:22.473 --> 01:20:22.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>in it.

1516
01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:23.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they started having

1517
01:20:23.748 --> 01:20:24.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>patches.

1518
01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.987
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they started submitting the

1519
01:20:26.008 --> 01:20:27.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>patches back to Bill Jolitz.

1520
01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:30.407
<v Elisabetta Mori>But Bill Jolitz was one of these

1521
01:20:30.447 --> 01:20:33.193
<v Elisabetta Mori>people that, you know, he was
going to do another release, but

1522
01:20:33.213 --> 01:20:34.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>it had to be perfect.

1523
01:20:34.241 --> 01:20:35.125
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it just kept getting

1524
01:20:35.145 --> 01:20:36.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>delayed and delayed and delayed.

1525
01:20:36.351 --> 01:20:37.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And his patch sets just kept

1526
01:20:37.706 --> 01:20:39.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>getting bigger and bigger and
bigger.

1527
01:20:40.182 --> 01:20:45.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>And finally, people sort of lost
patience with waiting for Bill to

1528
01:20:45.694 --> 01:20:46.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>do something.

1529
01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:51.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so two groups sprang out.

1530
01:20:52.402 --> 01:20:55.126
<v Elisabetta Mori>There were sort of, in this group
of people that were doing the

1531
01:20:55.166 --> 01:20:58.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>patch sets, there were the people
that felt they wanted to follow

1532
01:20:58.372 --> 01:21:00.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>the so-called BSD philosophy.

1533
01:21:02.182 --> 01:21:05.491
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was supporting multiple

1534
01:21:05.571 --> 01:21:07.476
<v Elisabetta Mori>different machine architectures.

1535
01:21:08.943 --> 01:21:14.513
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they wanted to push that

1536
01:21:14.553 --> 01:21:16.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>multi-architecture side.

1537
01:21:17.363 --> 01:21:18.385
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then there were the people

1538
01:21:18.465 --> 01:21:22.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>that said, look, we want to build
up a user base that aren't just

1539
01:21:22.534 --> 01:21:23.657
<v Elisabetta Mori>computer programmers.

1540
01:21:23.657 --> 01:21:26.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so we want to focus on the

1541
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:28.174
<v Elisabetta Mori>IBM PC architecture.

1542
01:21:29.123 --> 01:21:31.924
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the Intel, at that time,

1543
01:21:31.924 --> 01:21:32.292
<v Elisabetta Mori>386 processor.

1544
01:21:34.281 --> 01:21:39.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we want to package up CDs that

1545
01:21:39.248 --> 01:21:44.796
<v Elisabetta Mori>you can just put into your drive
and boot right off the CD so you

1546
01:21:44.836 --> 01:21:45.437
<v Elisabetta Mori>can try it out.

1547
01:21:45.437 --> 01:21:45.462
<v Elisabetta Mori>You it out.

1548
01:21:45.462 --> 01:21:46.852
<v Elisabetta Mori>You don't even have to put it on
your disk.

1549
01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:46.882
<v Elisabetta Mori>You your disk.

1550
01:21:46.882 --> 01:21:48.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>You can just run it straight off

1551
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:49.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>of the CD.

1552
01:21:49.761 --> 01:21:50.764
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then if you decide you like

1553
01:21:50.824 --> 01:21:54.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>it, you can then instruct it to
copy it to your disk and make it a

1554
01:21:54.593 --> 01:21:55.837
<v Elisabetta Mori>permanent part of your system.

1555
01:21:55.837 --> 01:21:57.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of your system.

1556
01:21:57.493 --> 01:22:00.848
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we want it to be as easy as
possible for people that are not

1557
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:05.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>savvy on how you write software
and compile software and do all

1558
01:22:05.095 --> 01:22:05.616
<v Elisabetta Mori>these other things.

1559
01:22:07.103 --> 01:22:08.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they were sort of

1560
01:22:08.989 --> 01:22:10.294
<v Elisabetta Mori>irreconcilable differences.

1561
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.102
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the people that wanted to do

1562
01:22:13.244 --> 01:22:16.708
<v Elisabetta Mori>the BSD philosophy became NetBSD.

1563
01:22:24.822 --> 01:22:26.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then the people that wanted to

1564
01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:28.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>do the wide distribution were
FreeBSD.

1565
01:22:29.305 --> 01:22:31.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I didn't want to take sides.

1566
01:22:31.594 --> 01:22:34.551
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's It's like, go out, be

1567
01:22:34.612 --> 01:22:35.133
<v Elisabetta Mori>productive.

1568
01:22:35.133 --> 01:22:36.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I didn't want it.

1569
01:22:36.923 --> 01:22:40.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when I would do things, I would
just send it to NetBSD and to

1570
01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:40.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>FreeBSD.

1571
01:22:41.603 --> 01:22:43.447
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they sort of developed and

1572
01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:46.815
<v Elisabetta Mori>I just kind of stood back for
about two years to see sort of

1573
01:22:46.835 --> 01:22:47.657
<v Elisabetta Mori>where things were going.

1574
01:22:49.124 --> 01:22:52.350
<v Elisabetta Mori>And eventually I saw that FreeBSD

1575
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:54.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>people were getting a lot more
usage.

1576
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.553
<v Elisabetta Mori>And my interest had always been
that the software be used as

1577
01:22:59.593 --> 01:23:00.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>widely as possible.

1578
01:23:00.641 --> 01:23:04.169
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I decided to align myself with,

1579
01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:06.915
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, make that sort of my
home base.

1580
01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:11.173
<v Elisabetta Mori>I still interact with the NetBSD
folks.

1581
01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:18.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>And NetBSD eventually split into
two groups, OpenBSD and NetBSD,

1582
01:23:18.571 --> 01:23:22.337
<v Elisabetta Mori>because of differences among them
as to what was important.

1583
01:23:23.022 --> 01:23:26.529
<v Elisabetta Mori>OpenBSD wanted to focus on
security and NetBSD wanted to

1584
01:23:26.989 --> 01:23:30.236
<v Elisabetta Mori>continue this sort of wide open
set of architectures.

1585
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:32.667
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they wanted to run in from
everything from your microwave

1586
01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:35.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>oven to your Cray XMP processor.

1587
01:23:36.704 --> 01:23:38.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>At their high point, I think they

1588
01:23:38.028 --> 01:23:39.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>supported about 80 different
architectures.

1589
01:23:41.863 --> 01:23:46.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>And FreeBSD, you know, initially
was just the Intel architecture,

1590
01:23:47.615 --> 01:23:48.176
<v Elisabetta Mori>plain and simple.

1591
01:23:48.201 --> 01:23:49.308
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they did that for quite a

1592
01:23:49.348 --> 01:23:49.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>while.

1593
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.671
<v Elisabetta Mori>But quite a while.

1594
01:23:49.671 --> 01:23:53.571
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it eventually became evident
that there were, in fact, some

1595
01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:55.275
<v Elisabetta Mori>other architectures that were of
interest.

1596
01:23:56.402 --> 01:24:01.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they took the framework
that NetBSD had developed for

1597
01:24:01.692 --> 01:24:04.497
<v Elisabetta Mori>supporting multiple architectures
and brought that into FreeBSD.

1598
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:06.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they didn't bring all the
architectures, but they brought,

1599
01:24:07.608 --> 01:24:10.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, there's probably four or
five now that supported in

1600
01:24:10.614 --> 01:24:11.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>FreeBSD.

1601
01:24:12.322 --> 01:24:14.066
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there's still, even today, a

1602
01:24:14.607 --> 01:24:18.995
<v Elisabetta Mori>flow of code back in between the
various BSD projects.

1603
01:24:20.946 --> 01:24:23.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's sort of a friendly rivalry, I
would say.

1604
01:24:24.322 --> 01:24:28.089
<v Elisabetta Mori>But as I say, I had to sort of
pick one that I was going to focus

1605
01:24:28.109 --> 01:24:32.417
<v Elisabetta Mori>my attention on and I chose
FreeBSD to be that one.

1606
01:24:33.122 --> 01:24:38.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I think I started committing
into FreeBSD somewhere in the mid

1607
01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:39.174
<v Elisabetta Mori>90s, 95 or 96, somewhere around
there.

1608
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:47.853
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, you know, as I say, I've
been sort of involved with them

1609
01:24:49.015 --> 01:24:50.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>ongoing since then.

1610
01:24:51.563 --> 01:24:53.687
<v Kirk McKusick>So what do you think are your

1611
01:24:53.927 --> 01:25:02.707
<v Kirk McKusick>major contributions to FreeBSD?
I'm going to actually back up and

1612
01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:07.455
<v Elisabetta Mori>start because some of the major
things I did while I was still at

1613
01:25:07.475 --> 01:25:07.836
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley.

1614
01:25:10.448 --> 01:25:11.431
<v Elisabetta Mori>The file system, of course, was

1615
01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:12.133
<v Elisabetta Mori>the first one.

1616
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:16.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>The next piece was that the port

1617
01:25:17.026 --> 01:25:25.176
<v Elisabetta Mori>that Bill did of Ozop's VM system
into Bill's style was very tied to

1618
01:25:25.236 --> 01:25:26.357
<v Elisabetta Mori>the VAX architecture.

1619
01:25:26.982 --> 01:25:29.488
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so if you wanted to run that

1620
01:25:29.568 --> 01:25:32.215
<v Elisabetta Mori>VM system on any other
architecture than the VAX

1621
01:25:32.255 --> 01:25:36.005
<v Elisabetta Mori>architecture, you essentially had
to write a shim layer that

1622
01:25:37.426 --> 01:25:43.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>converted from the VAX vagaries of
VM to whatever the bits and bytes

1623
01:25:43.133 --> 01:25:46.778
<v Elisabetta Mori>were that you needed for the VM
system that you were porting to.

1624
01:25:46.778 --> 01:25:46.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>And to.

1625
01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:52.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>And also the original one really

1626
01:25:52.228 --> 01:25:59.097
<v Elisabetta Mori>didn't deal with data sharing
between mappings of memory.

1627
01:25:59.842 --> 01:26:03.394
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it really was a need to
redo the VM system.

1628
01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:07.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this task fell to me.

1629
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.506
<v Elisabetta Mori>This was, it would have been in

1630
01:26:09.526 --> 01:26:10.469
<v Elisabetta Mori>about the mid 80s.

1631
01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:13.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there were sort of two

1632
01:26:13.449 --> 01:26:14.092
<v Elisabetta Mori>alternatives.

1633
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:16.309
<v Elisabetta Mori>One was from CMU.

1634
01:26:18.043 --> 01:26:21.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>They had done a system called
Mock, which was a microkernel.

1635
01:26:22.364 --> 01:26:25.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they had done a complete VM
system for that microkernel.

1636
01:26:25.635 --> 01:26:32.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And the other option was that
when Sun started up, they too

1637
01:26:32.110 --> 01:26:37.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>needed to get away from the very
VAX specific VM system.

1638
01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:42.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they rewrote the VM system
that again was generalized to work

1639
01:26:42.853 --> 01:26:44.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>with multiple architectures.

1640
01:26:45.383 --> 01:26:48.252
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the Sun one had been

1641
01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:49.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>written commercially.

1642
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.167
<v Elisabetta Mori>It had been put through the fire

1643
01:26:52.348 --> 01:26:55.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>of commercial distribution and bug
fixing and so on.

1644
01:26:55.481 --> 01:26:59.991
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it was extremely solid
versus the Carnegie Mellon one,

1645
01:27:00.091 --> 01:27:01.935
<v Elisabetta Mori>which was written by graduate
students.

1646
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>They were testing out a lot of VM
ideas.

1647
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.630
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there were a lot of sort of
dead end code in there.

1648
01:27:08.302 --> 01:27:11.448
<v Elisabetta Mori>Things that while academically
were interesting, were really not

1649
01:27:11.569 --> 01:27:15.496
<v Elisabetta Mori>all that useful for a production
system.

1650
01:27:15.541 --> 01:27:20.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it didn't have the production
testing that would necessarily be

1651
01:27:20.654 --> 01:27:20.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>needed.

1652
01:27:21.641 --> 01:27:24.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>So obviously my first goal was to

1653
01:27:24.389 --> 01:27:25.633
<v Elisabetta Mori>get the Sun code.

1654
01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.690
<v Elisabetta Mori>We had, BSD or Berkeley had worked

1655
01:27:28.771 --> 01:27:31.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>closely with Sun. I Sun. I mean,
obviously I knew Bill and so we

1656
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:32.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>had a good relationship.

1657
01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:35.146
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And the other people that came

1658
01:27:35.206 --> 01:27:39.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>to Sun were all people that we had
worked with previously at

1659
01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:40.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley.

1660
01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.609
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there was a lot of code sharing

1661
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:46.756
<v Elisabetta Mori>that went on between Sun and
Berkeley.

1662
01:27:46.756 --> 01:27:47.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>Bug Berkeley.

1663
01:27:47.934 --> 01:27:49.127
<v Elisabetta Mori>Bug fixes that we'd get, we'd send

1664
01:27:49.147 --> 01:27:53.783
<v Elisabetta Mori>to them and vice versa with the
agreement of the folks at Sun. So

1665
01:27:54.584 --> 01:27:58.371
<v Elisabetta Mori>when it came time for the VM, I
said, well, I'd love to

1666
01:27:58.612 --> 01:28:02.078
<v Elisabetta Mori>incorporate the Sun's VM and
replace ours.

1667
01:28:02.078 --> 01:28:02.118
<v Elisabetta Mori>With the Sun VM.

1668
01:28:02.118 --> 01:28:02.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>replace With the Sun VM.

1669
01:28:04.283 --> 01:28:06.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, that'll be good
because, you know, we'll be able

1670
01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:08.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>to continue fixing bugs for each
other.

1671
01:28:08.515 --> 01:28:08.652
<v Elisabetta Mori>And other.

1672
01:28:08.652 --> 01:28:09.906
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that's, you know, that's the

1673
01:28:09.926 --> 01:28:12.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>whole open source thing, even
though they weren't open source.

1674
01:28:12.234 --> 01:28:13.265
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they And they agreed.

1675
01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.545
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we went to their manager

1676
01:28:17.685 --> 01:28:20.772
<v Elisabetta Mori>and from their manager, it went
blah, blah, blah, all the way up

1677
01:28:20.832 --> 01:28:22.216
<v Elisabetta Mori>to eventually Scott McNeely.

1678
01:28:22.216 --> 01:28:23.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>He He was the CEO.

1679
01:28:24.242 --> 01:28:29.152
<v Elisabetta Mori>And somewhat to our pleasant
surprise, Scott McNeely said,

1680
01:28:29.192 --> 01:28:31.496
<v Elisabetta Mori>well, yeah, that actually does
seem like a good idea.

1681
01:28:33.043 --> 01:28:37.770
<v Elisabetta Mori>But we need to get our lawyers,
the Sun lawyers to, you know,

1682
01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:42.537
<v Elisabetta Mori>write a thing, you know, to make
sure that it's all done properly.

1683
01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:48.626
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it was sent off to the Sun
lawyers and the Sun lawyers came

1684
01:28:48.667 --> 01:28:55.053
<v Elisabetta Mori>back to Scott and said, you know,
you could be sued by your

1685
01:28:55.193 --> 01:28:59.478
<v Elisabetta Mori>stockholders for giving away
company assets.

1686
01:29:00.645 --> 01:29:03.775
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we don't really recommend that
you do this.

1687
01:29:05.084 --> 01:29:09.975
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they said, came back and
said, well, you know, our lawyers

1688
01:29:10.015 --> 01:29:10.877
<v Elisabetta Mori>say we can't do this.

1689
01:29:10.877 --> 01:29:10.947
<v Elisabetta Mori>This is long before open say we

1690
01:29:10.947 --> 01:29:10.977
<v Elisabetta Mori>can't do this.

1691
01:29:10.977 --> 01:29:11.887
<v Elisabetta Mori>This is long before open Solaris.

1692
01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.373
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, I mean, they eventually,
you know, came around to that

1693
01:29:16.413 --> 01:29:16.574
<v Elisabetta Mori>idea.

1694
01:29:16.661 --> 01:29:18.466
<v Elisabetta Mori>But open source was still not a

1695
01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:22.275
<v Elisabetta Mori>well-founded idea in the
commercial world at that time.

1696
01:29:22.902 --> 01:29:28.536
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the only option I had was the
mock code, the CMU code.

1697
01:29:29.601 --> 01:29:35.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I collaborated with some
folks at the University of Utah

1698
01:29:35.306 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Elisabetta Mori>who, in fact, did most of the work
of getting the port done and then

1699
01:29:40.471 --> 01:29:45.976
<v Elisabetta Mori>brought that into BSD and, you
know, filed off the rough edges

1700
01:29:46.336 --> 01:29:50.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>and made that operational, which
is the thing that then allowed it

1701
01:29:51.046 --> 01:29:55.236
<v Elisabetta Mori>to work well on the 386 and the
other processors.

1702
01:29:56.521 --> 01:30:01.685
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in fact, it was not until
David Greenman and some other

1703
01:30:01.745 --> 01:30:05.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>folks at FreeBSD actually went in
and ripped out a lot of the dead

1704
01:30:06.029 --> 01:30:12.034
<v Elisabetta Mori>code and useless code and other
bits and really cleaned up and

1705
01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:16.798
<v Elisabetta Mori>tuned up the mock code before it
became really sort of production.

1706
01:30:16.798 --> 01:30:16.882
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, of production.

1707
01:30:16.882 --> 01:30:19.047
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, it was production ready,

1708
01:30:19.087 --> 01:30:22.937
<v Elisabetta Mori>but it wasn't very efficient and
they really got it to sing.

1709
01:30:23.983 --> 01:30:28.472
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I view the VM system as a major
contribution, despite the fact

1710
01:30:28.492 --> 01:30:30.356
<v Elisabetta Mori>that it was primarily done by
other people.

1711
01:30:30.441 --> 01:30:33.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>But that's what being a manager is
all about.

1712
01:30:33.502 --> 01:30:33.682
<v Elisabetta Mori>Right.

1713
01:30:33.742 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's like you coordinate,

1714
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:36.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>you're the conductor.

1715
01:30:36.353 --> 01:30:40.627
<v Elisabetta Mori>Then Then another piece that I

1716
01:30:40.807 --> 01:30:46.716
<v Elisabetta Mori>really view as something that was
pretty important was remote file

1717
01:30:46.736 --> 01:30:47.157
<v Elisabetta Mori>systems.

1718
01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.925
<v Elisabetta Mori>So remote file systems, again, was

1719
01:30:50.105 --> 01:30:54.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>a thing that there was a huge
history of development and lots of

1720
01:30:54.894 --> 01:30:56.056
<v Elisabetta Mori>different ones came out.

1721
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.442
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the one that sort of shook

1722
01:30:57.523 --> 01:31:03.314
<v Elisabetta Mori>down and was long term successful
was NFS, which again was a thing

1723
01:31:03.354 --> 01:31:04.236
<v Elisabetta Mori>that Sun developed.

1724
01:31:05.722 --> 01:31:10.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they sold that to, you know,

1725
01:31:10.128 --> 01:31:14.494
<v Elisabetta Mori>any of their customers that
wanted, you know, their hardware

1726
01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:15.937
<v Elisabetta Mori>customers that wanted to be able
to ship it.

1727
01:31:17.243 --> 01:31:20.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, again, we went to them and
said, well, you know, can we get

1728
01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:21.983
<v Elisabetta Mori>it?
It's like, well, if we give it

1729
01:31:22.024 --> 01:31:24.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>away to you, then we can't sell it
to these other people.

1730
01:31:24.221 --> 01:31:25.550
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we can't do that.

1731
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:26.643
<v Elisabetta Mori>But But we'll still let you come

1732
01:31:26.683 --> 01:31:28.927
<v Elisabetta Mori>to this thing they called
Connectathon, where everybody that

1733
01:31:28.967 --> 01:31:32.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>had an NFS implementation would
get together and make sure that

1734
01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:33.777
<v Elisabetta Mori>they all interoperated with each
other.

1735
01:31:33.777 --> 01:31:34.993
<v Elisabetta Mori>Which with each other.

1736
01:31:34.993 --> 01:31:37.328
<v Elisabetta Mori>Which was phenomenally important

1737
01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:40.294
<v Elisabetta Mori>because at the high point, there
were probably 30 different

1738
01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:41.496
<v Elisabetta Mori>implementations out there.

1739
01:31:41.602 --> 01:31:43.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so having them all work

1740
01:31:43.648 --> 01:31:45.856
<v Elisabetta Mori>together was important.

1741
01:31:45.856 --> 01:31:47.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And IBM was one of the ones

1742
01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:47.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>that had one.

1743
01:31:47.793 --> 01:31:48.022
<v Elisabetta Mori>And ones that had one.

1744
01:31:48.022 --> 01:31:52.676
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there's in the typical or
sorry, Microsoft had one.

1745
01:31:52.676 --> 01:31:52.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one.

1746
01:31:52.832 --> 01:31:55.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in their typical way was just

1747
01:31:55.147 --> 01:31:58.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>like, well, you know, we do NFS
the way we want to do it.

1748
01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:03.027
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it didn't interoperate
well, but there would be this big

1749
01:32:03.127 --> 01:32:06.692
<v Elisabetta Mori>grid, you know, and it'd be like,
you know, who, you know, everybody

1750
01:32:06.732 --> 01:32:10.417
<v Elisabetta Mori>would show that they could both
serve and receive from.

1751
01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:13.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so there was a big chart with
little X's where everyone had

1752
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:13.993
<v Elisabetta Mori>passed the test.

1753
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.462
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it was this kind of diagonal

1754
01:32:15.502 --> 01:32:21.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>line that was Microsoft where, you
know, that nobody else could pass

1755
01:32:21.513 --> 01:32:22.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>either reading or writing to them.

1756
01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:26.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they eventually got the

1757
01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:28.592
<v Elisabetta Mori>message and changed their
implementation to work with

1758
01:32:28.632 --> 01:32:29.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>everybody else, which was good.

1759
01:32:31.021 --> 01:32:34.627
<v Elisabetta Mori>Anyway, it required structurally

1760
01:32:34.687 --> 01:32:37.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>changing the operating system to
add a lawyer, which allowed you to

1761
01:32:37.933 --> 01:32:39.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of switch off to different
file systems.

1762
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:44.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>Or NFS or, you know, many others
that eventually came about.

1763
01:32:45.883 --> 01:32:47.489
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I did that.

1764
01:32:48.801 --> 01:32:52.850
<v Elisabetta Mori>And again, with NFS, Rick Macklin

1765
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:54.915
<v Elisabetta Mori>did most of the work of actually
writing NFS.

1766
01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.349
<v Elisabetta Mori>But I coordinated with getting him
getting that in there and getting

1767
01:33:01.369 --> 01:33:05.675
<v Elisabetta Mori>us down to the Connectathon and
making sure that we interoperated

1768
01:33:05.775 --> 01:33:06.736
<v Elisabetta Mori>and so on and so forth.

1769
01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:09.947
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I sort of think of myself as,

1770
01:33:09.967 --> 01:33:12.874
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, being the person that
takes credit for that.

1771
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, you know, again, with a lot
of other people doing most of the

1772
01:33:16.351 --> 01:33:16.511
<v Elisabetta Mori>work.

1773
01:33:17.702 --> 01:33:19.527
<v Elisabetta Mori>So sort of the three big pieces

1774
01:33:19.567 --> 01:33:21.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>that came for me out of, well,
four big pieces.

1775
01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:27.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>One was the actual file system,
the fast file system, the VM

1776
01:33:27.086 --> 01:33:32.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>system, the switch to allow
multiple file systems and NFS and

1777
01:33:33.295 --> 01:33:34.857
<v Elisabetta Mori>driving getting it open sourced.

1778
01:33:36.363 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that's that's those are the big

1779
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:39.332
<v Elisabetta Mori>pieces there.

1780
01:33:40.663 --> 01:33:41.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>Now, moving to FreeBSD.

1781
01:33:43.063 --> 01:33:46.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>A lot of that at that point.

1782
01:33:49.645 --> 01:33:50.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, I was doing this thing

1783
01:33:50.828 --> 01:33:53.755
<v Elisabetta Mori>called soft updates, which was a
way to speed up.

1784
01:33:56.544 --> 01:33:58.487
<v Elisabetta Mori>To reduce the amount of
synchronous writing that you had

1785
01:33:58.527 --> 01:34:01.772
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do the disks and especially
with the old spinning rust disks,

1786
01:34:01.913 --> 01:34:03.896
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was a big deal.

1787
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.265
<v Elisabetta Mori>It essentially gave you about 10x

1788
01:34:06.305 --> 01:34:09.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>the throughput in your file system
that you would otherwise have for

1789
01:34:10.015 --> 01:34:10.756
<v Elisabetta Mori>a certain workload.

1790
01:34:10.756 --> 01:34:10.844
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I was working on a certain

1791
01:34:10.844 --> 01:34:10.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>workload.

1792
01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:11.085
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I was working on that.

1793
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.133
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that was one of the big things
that I did in conjunction with

1794
01:34:18.755 --> 01:34:19.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>FreeBSD.

1795
01:34:21.286 --> 01:34:22.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that that's kind of the other

1796
01:34:22.911 --> 01:34:24.154
<v Elisabetta Mori>big piece of technology.

1797
01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:25.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>There were a lot of little pieces

1798
01:34:25.648 --> 01:34:26.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>of technology.

1799
01:34:26.391 --> 01:34:26.883
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, I mean, there was

1800
01:34:26.923 --> 01:34:29.835
<v Elisabetta Mori>something stupid like what seems
stupid at the time.

1801
01:34:29.835 --> 01:34:29.885
<v Elisabetta Mori>But stupid at the time.

1802
01:34:29.885 --> 01:34:31.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>But we had all these link lists,

1803
01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:33.635
<v Elisabetta Mori>which is just a data structure
that you use all over the place.

1804
01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:33.705
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they were all over the place.

1805
01:34:33.705 --> 01:34:34.666
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they were all hand coded.

1806
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so anytime you needed to do
it, you had to find that four

1807
01:34:39.227 --> 01:34:42.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>lines of code over there and bring
it here and change the names of

1808
01:34:42.855 --> 01:34:43.757
<v Elisabetta Mori>things to make it work.

1809
01:34:43.757 --> 01:34:44.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it work.

1810
01:34:44.686 --> 01:34:46.493
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I said, well, this is
crazy.

1811
01:34:46.493 --> 01:34:52.984
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And I wrote this thing called
the Q macros, Q dot H. And it's

1812
01:34:53.025 --> 01:34:56.453
<v Elisabetta Mori>just like one lines that you drop
in instead of having to copy stuff

1813
01:34:56.493 --> 01:34:56.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>around.

1814
01:34:57.501 --> 01:35:00.327
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that prototype, which was

1815
01:35:00.407 --> 01:35:03.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually done in the BSD days, you
know, now just absolutely

1816
01:35:03.855 --> 01:35:04.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>pervades.

1817
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:06.167
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in fact, it was adopted by

1818
01:35:06.227 --> 01:35:08.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>Linux because they needed the same
thing.

1819
01:35:08.354 --> 01:35:10.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And they actually just took
that from us.

1820
01:35:12.164 --> 01:35:14.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>They have the copyright in there,
but it's kind of hidden.

1821
01:35:14.582 --> 01:35:17.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>They put the GPL on top of it
first.

1822
01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:24.071
<v Elisabetta Mori>But But at any rate, little things
like that seemed insignificant at

1823
01:35:24.091 --> 01:35:27.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>the time, but actually have proven
to be very widely used these days.

1824
01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:35.853
<v Elisabetta Mori>Other than that, really, my goal
with FreeBSD was that I wanted BSD

1825
01:35:35.873 --> 01:35:38.217
<v Elisabetta Mori>to continue after me.

1826
01:35:39.885 --> 01:35:42.573
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I wanted to set up a

1827
01:35:42.633 --> 01:35:43.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>structure.

1828
01:35:44.587 --> 01:35:45.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>If you look, well, let me back up.

1829
01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:49.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>If you look at most open source
projects, they come about because

1830
01:35:49.788 --> 01:35:53.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>you have somebody who has an idea
and becomes the leader of that

1831
01:35:53.535 --> 01:35:54.016
<v Elisabetta Mori>project.

1832
01:35:54.963 --> 01:35:57.170
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, they champion it

1833
01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:57.872
<v Elisabetta Mori>going forward.

1834
01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:00.467
<v Elisabetta Mori>And when they get bored with it

1835
01:36:00.627 --> 01:36:03.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>and leave, usually it just
collapses at that point.

1836
01:36:05.725 --> 01:36:11.116
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, I mean, if you
look at Linux, I mean, that's been

1837
01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:11.537
<v Elisabetta Mori>Linus.

1838
01:36:11.537 --> 01:36:12.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, And, you know, it's not quite

1839
01:36:12.784 --> 01:36:16.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>clear what happens when Linus is
no longer either doing it or has

1840
01:36:16.493 --> 01:36:17.095
<v Elisabetta Mori>passed away.

1841
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.025
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, at this point, you know,

1842
01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:22.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>it'll just be taken over by
probably the big corporations.

1843
01:36:23.062 --> 01:36:29.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, you know, in the case of BSD,
I didn't.

1844
01:36:29.461 --> 01:36:32.411
<v Elisabetta Mori>I had been the grand omnipotent
high stomper for a decade, and I

1845
01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:33.494
<v Elisabetta Mori>was tired of doing that.

1846
01:36:33.494 --> 01:36:33.533
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, that.

1847
01:36:33.533 --> 01:36:34.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, I mean, I couldn't.

1848
01:36:34.742 --> 01:36:35.925
<v Elisabetta Mori>If I went on vacation and

1849
01:36:35.965 --> 01:36:39.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>something broke, you know, bad
things would happen.

1850
01:36:39.904 --> 01:36:41.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I couldn't really leave.

1851
01:36:42.264 --> 01:36:44.632
<v Elisabetta Mori>And also, it's just it's a huge

1852
01:36:44.652 --> 01:36:45.073
<v Elisabetta Mori>amount of work.

1853
01:36:45.381 --> 01:36:47.948
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I wanted to set up some kind of

1854
01:36:47.988 --> 01:36:50.882
<v Elisabetta Mori>a structure where I wasn't going
to be the person in charge, which

1855
01:36:50.923 --> 01:36:53.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>is part of the reason that I kind
of stepped aside and let the

1856
01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:54.434
<v Elisabetta Mori>groups organize themselves.

1857
01:36:55.262 --> 01:36:58.687
<v Elisabetta Mori>But in the case of FreeBSD, a lot

1858
01:36:58.707 --> 01:37:02.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>of what I've done really is
dealing with the social structure

1859
01:37:02.414 --> 01:37:03.956
<v Elisabetta Mori>as opposed to just the code base.

1860
01:37:05.362 --> 01:37:09.789
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when FreeBSD, they created this

1861
01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:13.195
<v Elisabetta Mori>concept of a core group, which is
a set of people that are sort of

1862
01:37:13.575 --> 01:37:14.537
<v Elisabetta Mori>overall in charge.

1863
01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:17.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And they were self-appointed

1864
01:37:18.314 --> 01:37:18.715
<v Elisabetta Mori>for life.

1865
01:37:19.587 --> 01:37:20.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>So you had this set of people.

1866
01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:21.323
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the problem this set of
people.

1867
01:37:21.323 --> 01:37:23.790
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the problem you have with any
open source project is that people

1868
01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.375
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of lose interest in.

1869
01:37:25.804 --> 01:37:27.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so you end up having deadwood.

1870
01:37:27.693 --> 01:37:27.751
<v Elisabetta Mori>You deadwood.

1871
01:37:27.751 --> 01:37:29.224
<v Elisabetta Mori>You have to have some way of, you

1872
01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:34.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, moving aside the deadwood so
that people that are going to

1873
01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:36.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually do something can get in
there and do it.

1874
01:37:37.682 --> 01:37:45.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what we decided to do was
to make the core group instead of

1875
01:37:45.312 --> 01:37:49.277
<v Elisabetta Mori>just, you know, appointed for life
is they would be elected.

1876
01:37:49.277 --> 01:37:55.873
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so there's committers
where people that are allowed to

1877
01:37:56.094 --> 01:37:57.537
<v Elisabetta Mori>essentially change the code base.

1878
01:37:57.537 --> 01:37:57.577
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there's 300 code base.

1879
01:37:57.577 --> 01:37:59.228
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there's 300 and some of them.

1880
01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:03.830
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the core then will be

1881
01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:05.676
<v Elisabetta Mori>elected from the committers.

1882
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:08.268
<v Elisabetta Mori>So any committer that wants to run

1883
01:38:08.308 --> 01:38:10.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>for core can, every two years,
they just raise their hands and

1884
01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:11.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>say, I want to run.

1885
01:38:12.024 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so you get some set of people

1886
01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:14.514
<v Elisabetta Mori>that want to run.

1887
01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:15.162
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then to run.

1888
01:38:15.162 --> 01:38:18.992
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then the committers each get
to vote for the nine people they

1889
01:38:19.032 --> 01:38:20.215
<v Elisabetta Mori>want to be on core.

1890
01:38:21.163 --> 01:38:23.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the top nine vote getters

1891
01:38:23.712 --> 01:38:24.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>become the next core.

1892
01:38:25.345 --> 01:38:26.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the entire core can change

1893
01:38:26.811 --> 01:38:26.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>over.

1894
01:38:27.482 --> 01:38:28.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>Typically doesn't, thankfully.

1895
01:38:29.962 --> 01:38:34.553
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the point is that unlike the
Linux project, it can rise up to a

1896
01:38:34.593 --> 01:38:35.175
<v Elisabetta Mori>certain level.

1897
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:38.166
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, you know, it's pretty

1898
01:38:38.206 --> 01:38:41.753
<v Elisabetta Mori>hard to become one of Linus's
lieutenants and you can't become

1899
01:38:41.813 --> 01:38:42.154
<v Elisabetta Mori>Linus.

1900
01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:48.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the change over here is that

1901
01:38:48.367 --> 01:38:53.954
<v Elisabetta Mori>there have been probably, I'd say,
it's argument of four or five sort

1902
01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:55.917
<v Elisabetta Mori>of change of the top leadership.

1903
01:38:56.861 --> 01:38:58.063
<v Elisabetta Mori>So someone sort of gets up there

1904
01:38:58.123 --> 01:39:01.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>and sort of a couple of people
sort of do stuff, you know, and

1905
01:39:01.909 --> 01:39:05.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>then they sort of fade away and a
new set of leaders comes into

1906
01:39:05.535 --> 01:39:05.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>play.

1907
01:39:07.063 --> 01:39:08.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, people can just

1908
01:39:08.587 --> 01:39:10.813
<v Elisabetta Mori>rise through the organization and
become those leaders.

1909
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that has worked very well.

1910
01:39:13.401 --> 01:39:15.807
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I view that as kind of an

1911
01:39:15.847 --> 01:39:18.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>accomplishment, even though it's,
you know, technically it's not an

1912
01:39:18.513 --> 01:39:19.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>accomplishment.

1913
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.027
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it's an accomplishment of my

1914
01:39:22.047 --> 01:39:24.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>goal of BSD continuing.

1915
01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:26.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, now that I'm nearly 70,

1916
01:39:27.385 --> 01:39:30.592
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, I just don't have quite
the capability of doing what I

1917
01:39:30.612 --> 01:39:31.674
<v Elisabetta Mori>could do when I was in my 30s.

1918
01:39:33.682 --> 01:39:36.226
<v Kirk McKusick>Another thing you're famous for is

1919
01:39:36.326 --> 01:39:42.716
<v Kirk McKusick>the BSD daemon that is used to
identify BSD and it's copyrighted

1920
01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.177
<v Kirk McKusick>by you.

1921
01:39:45.583 --> 01:39:49.748
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I guess one of the other things

1922
01:39:49.788 --> 01:39:54.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I'm proud of as an
accomplishment is actually the

1923
01:39:54.794 --> 01:39:57.157
<v Elisabetta Mori>text set of textbooks we've had
about BSD.

1924
01:39:58.724 --> 01:40:02.593
<v Elisabetta Mori>We first wanted to write a
textbook in the early 80s.

1925
01:40:04.424 --> 01:40:08.616
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we sort of got together a
proposal for a book.

1926
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:11.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>This would have at the time would
have been Sam Loeffler, who was

1927
01:40:11.965 --> 01:40:20.718
<v Elisabetta Mori>one of the people at CSRG and
myself and Mike Carls.

1928
01:40:20.718 --> 01:40:28.856
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so we put together a
proposal and went to Addison

1929
01:40:28.896 --> 01:40:29.357
<v Elisabetta Mori>Wesley.

1930
01:40:30.462 --> 01:40:32.765
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Addison Wesley said, well, you

1931
01:40:32.805 --> 01:40:38.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, we need to get AT&T's
agreement that you can do this,

1932
01:40:38.914 --> 01:40:40.696
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, that you're not going to
be giving away their trade

1933
01:40:40.736 --> 01:40:41.137
<v Elisabetta Mori>secrets.

1934
01:40:42.422 --> 01:40:45.488
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we went to AT&T and AT&T

1935
01:40:45.509 --> 01:40:47.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>said, well, go write the book and
then we'll read it and let you

1936
01:40:47.753 --> 01:40:48.955
<v Elisabetta Mori>know if we have any problems with
it.

1937
01:40:49.763 --> 01:40:51.251
<v Elisabetta Mori>Like, yeah, right.

1938
01:40:52.585 --> 01:40:54.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that got kind of shelved.

1939
01:40:56.021 --> 01:41:01.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>But then in 1986, I'm spacing on
the name of the guy that wrote the

1940
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:06.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>book, but a book was written about
the internals of System 5.

1941
01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:14.390
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so at that point, we went to
our publisher and said, well,

1942
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:17.414
<v Elisabetta Mori>look, you know, they have
published this book and it's in

1943
01:41:17.494 --> 01:41:19.177
<v Elisabetta Mori>more detail than we plan to be in.

1944
01:41:20.524 --> 01:41:22.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, we feel that it

1945
01:41:22.891 --> 01:41:23.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>would be safe to publish it.

1946
01:41:24.401 --> 01:41:26.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Brad Addison Wesley said,

1947
01:41:26.469 --> 01:41:27.172
<v Elisabetta Mori>yeah, fine.

1948
01:41:28.103 --> 01:41:30.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we wrote that, started writing

1949
01:41:30.469 --> 01:41:32.315
<v Elisabetta Mori>that book in 86, took us a couple
of years.

1950
01:41:33.281 --> 01:41:38.387
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so by 1988, we are ready to
publish the design and

1951
01:41:38.447 --> 01:41:43.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>implementation of the free BSD, of
the UNIC, of the design and

1952
01:41:43.733 --> 01:41:46.857
<v Elisabetta Mori>implementation of the BSD
operating system.

1953
01:41:48.543 --> 01:41:53.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we need, of course, a cover
for the book.

1954
01:41:54.122 --> 01:41:58.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course, Addison Wesley is
happy to come up with some

1955
01:41:58.873 --> 01:42:00.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>textbooky looking cover.

1956
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.848
<v Elisabetta Mori>But Sam Loeffler, who was the lead

1957
01:42:04.908 --> 01:42:08.014
<v Elisabetta Mori>author on that book, said, well,
no, you know, we need something

1958
01:42:08.034 --> 01:42:09.196
<v Elisabetta Mori>more distinctive than that.

1959
01:42:10.582 --> 01:42:12.546
<v Elisabetta Mori>So he had actually left the CSRG

1960
01:42:12.586 --> 01:42:17.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>at that point and was working for
George Lucas in what was at the

1961
01:42:17.775 --> 01:42:18.817
<v Elisabetta Mori>time called Lucasfilm.

1962
01:42:18.817 --> 01:42:20.276
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Lucasfilm.

1963
01:42:20.276 --> 01:42:23.756
<v Elisabetta Mori>And this was, you know, the Star
Wars that started coming out.

1964
01:42:24.283 --> 01:42:28.455
<v Elisabetta Mori>And all of those movies were made
with models and blue screening and

1965
01:42:28.495 --> 01:42:28.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>so on.

1966
01:42:29.683 --> 01:42:31.486
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it was clear that that

1967
01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:34.932
<v Elisabetta Mori>computer graphics was going to be
able to at least start augmenting

1968
01:42:34.972 --> 01:42:37.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>things like the star backgrounds
and things like that.

1969
01:42:37.256 --> 01:42:41.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, And, of course, as we know
today, you know, completely do the

1970
01:42:41.673 --> 01:42:42.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>entire effect.

1971
01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:45.885
<v Elisabetta Mori>But so he was working in the

1972
01:42:46.005 --> 01:42:52.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>Lucasfilm computer division
designing these various bits and

1973
01:42:52.654 --> 01:42:55.578
<v Elisabetta Mori>pieces that they were going to
that they used in the Star Wars

1974
01:42:55.618 --> 01:42:55.898
<v Elisabetta Mori>movies.

1975
01:42:57.483 --> 01:43:04.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>And John Lasseter was a lead

1976
01:43:04.474 --> 01:43:06.778
<v Elisabetta Mori>animator for Walt Disney.

1977
01:43:06.778 --> 01:43:06.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Disney.

1978
01:43:06.791 --> 01:43:14.136
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this is in the days, you
know, where all of the cartoons

1979
01:43:14.176 --> 01:43:14.777
<v Elisabetta Mori>are hand drawn.

1980
01:43:14.777 --> 01:43:14.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>And drawn.

1981
01:43:14.811 --> 01:43:22.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>And there are sort of three levels
of hierarchy in the cartoon

1982
01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:23.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>business.

1983
01:43:23.861 --> 01:43:27.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>So you have the lead animator and

1984
01:43:27.228 --> 01:43:31.557
<v Elisabetta Mori>he draws a detailed picture about
one second apart.

1985
01:43:31.557 --> 01:43:31.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>And apart.

1986
01:43:31.591 --> 01:43:35.131
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then the tier below him are

1987
01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:36.415
<v Elisabetta Mori>called the in-betweeners.

1988
01:43:36.842 --> 01:43:38.892
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they create the other 23

1989
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:41.395
<v Elisabetta Mori>frames that get from here to here.

1990
01:43:42.503 --> 01:43:44.366
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then the lowest level people

1991
01:43:44.907 --> 01:43:48.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>are the ones that fill in the
colors of everything and draw the

1992
01:43:48.775 --> 01:43:49.897
<v Elisabetta Mori>tail on Mickey Mouse.

1993
01:43:49.897 --> 01:43:50.173
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you on Mickey Mouse.

1994
01:43:50.173 --> 01:43:53.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, their creativity is
making the tail go or something

1995
01:43:53.753 --> 01:43:54.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>like that.

1996
01:43:55.081 --> 01:43:58.547
<v Elisabetta Mori>At any rate, the lead animators,

1997
01:43:58.627 --> 01:44:03.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>of course, are the ones that have
the most artistic control and the,

1998
01:44:03.575 --> 01:44:08.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, etc. And much like
university professors, they at

1999
01:44:09.132 --> 01:44:10.997
<v Elisabetta Mori>least in those days got a
sabbatical.

2000
01:44:10.997 --> 01:44:11.723
<v Elisabetta Mori>So every a sabbatical.

2001
01:44:11.723 --> 01:44:13.066
<v Elisabetta Mori>So every I don't know what it was,

2002
01:44:13.406 --> 01:44:17.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>six years or so, they would get
six months off to refresh

2003
01:44:17.955 --> 01:44:18.436
<v Elisabetta Mori>themselves.

2004
01:44:19.802 --> 01:44:22.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>And John Lasseter was very

2005
01:44:22.647 --> 01:44:26.873
<v Elisabetta Mori>interested in bringing more
computer technology to bear

2006
01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:29.617
<v Elisabetta Mori>because everything was totally
done by hand at that point.

2007
01:44:29.617 --> 01:44:31.453
<v Elisabetta Mori>And point.

2008
01:44:31.453 --> 01:44:34.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he did his sabbatical for

2009
01:44:34.867 --> 01:44:38.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>six months at Lucasfilm where he
could work with these people that

2010
01:44:38.371 --> 01:44:43.337
<v Elisabetta Mori>were busily, you know, doing this
animations for movie stuff.

2011
01:44:44.483 --> 01:44:47.409
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in particular, one of the
things that Lucasfilm was trying

2012
01:44:47.449 --> 01:44:50.677
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do was an animator's
workstation.

2013
01:44:51.762 --> 01:44:55.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>So they wanted to have something
where an animator like, say, John

2014
01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:00.136
<v Elisabetta Mori>would be able to, you know, draw
these frames for them.

2015
01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:02.546
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, they could autofill
colors because, you know, we can

2016
01:45:02.566 --> 01:45:04.972
<v Elisabetta Mori>figure out where the lines are and
the blue needs to go out to the

2017
01:45:05.012 --> 01:45:06.175
<v Elisabetta Mori>edge of the line, that kind of
thing.

2018
01:45:08.527 --> 01:45:11.415
<v Elisabetta Mori>And also, in theory, could do some
of the in-betweening.

2019
01:45:11.981 --> 01:45:16.407
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so they had all these people
at Lucasfilm that were very good

2020
01:45:16.447 --> 01:45:19.572
<v Elisabetta Mori>with computers, but they had no
idea at all what an animator ought

2021
01:45:19.612 --> 01:45:23.137
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do, would need, you know, what
kind of, what interface do they

2022
01:45:23.217 --> 01:45:27.372
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually want?
And so Lasseter coming to

2023
01:45:27.532 --> 01:45:29.137
<v Elisabetta Mori>Lucasfilm, he helped them.

2024
01:45:29.137 --> 01:45:29.195
<v Elisabetta Mori>He said, he helped them.

2025
01:45:29.195 --> 01:45:30.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>He said, you know, this is what I
want.

2026
01:45:30.351 --> 01:45:31.691
<v Elisabetta Mori>No, No, no, not like that.

2027
01:45:31.691 --> 01:45:31.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>I that.

2028
01:45:31.732 --> 01:45:34.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't want to have to take my
mouse and do this, you know,

2029
01:45:34.574 --> 01:45:34.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>whatever.

2030
01:45:35.863 --> 01:45:38.328
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he was working with them to

2031
01:45:38.368 --> 01:45:42.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>design this workstation, animated
workstation.

2032
01:45:43.482 --> 01:45:51.115
<v Elisabetta Mori>So Sam Leffler said, well, here,
you know, we've got this guy

2033
01:45:51.155 --> 01:45:52.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>that's really good at drawing
things.

2034
01:45:53.703 --> 01:46:00.136
<v Elisabetta Mori>Could you draw us a picture of a
demon to go on the front cover of

2035
01:46:00.276 --> 01:46:07.188
<v Elisabetta Mori>our textbook?
And so John just literally pulled

2036
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:11.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>a piece of cardboard out of the
trash can, some chalk off the

2037
01:46:11.274 --> 01:46:14.898
<v Elisabetta Mori>chalkboard, and in the space of a
few minutes, drew this thing up.

2038
01:46:14.898 --> 01:46:14.918
<v Elisabetta Mori>In up.

2039
01:46:14.918 --> 01:46:18.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>In fact, well, I actually have

2040
01:46:18.929 --> 01:46:22.597
<v Elisabetta Mori>that frame sitting in my office
over here and signed by him.

2041
01:46:23.702 --> 01:46:31.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I went to, you know, we
went back to Edison and said,

2042
01:46:31.275 --> 01:46:33.198
<v Elisabetta Mori>well, you know, we want this on
our front cover.

2043
01:46:33.198 --> 01:46:33.445
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they on our front cover.

2044
01:46:33.445 --> 01:46:34.068
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they look at it and they go,

2045
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:35.755
<v Elisabetta Mori>you must be kidding.

2046
01:46:35.755 --> 01:46:35.823
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, be kidding.

2047
01:46:35.823 --> 01:46:38.955
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, it looks like a cartoon.

2048
01:46:38.955 --> 01:46:39.256
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like, well, looks like a

2049
01:46:39.256 --> 01:46:39.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>cartoon.

2050
01:46:39.266 --> 01:46:40.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like, well, yeah, because it

2051
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>is a cartoon.

2052
01:46:42.145 --> 01:46:45.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, you know, and we, none of us

2053
01:46:45.152 --> 01:46:47.097
<v Elisabetta Mori>had ever written a textbook
before, you know.

2054
01:46:47.183 --> 01:46:50.673
<v Elisabetta Mori>So how are these people that know
nothing about textbooks, you know,

2055
01:46:50.974 --> 01:46:51.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>but whatever.

2056
01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>They finally agreed to do it.

2057
01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:57.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>But when they put it on the cover,
they did not include John

2058
01:46:57.553 --> 01:46:58.255
<v Elisabetta Mori>Lasseter's name.

2059
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:00.667
<v Elisabetta Mori>So if you look on that version of

2060
01:47:00.707 --> 01:47:03.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>the textbook, you see just the
thing.

2061
01:47:03.962 --> 01:47:08.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he's standing there with his
trident and there's the glowing

2062
01:47:08.293 --> 01:47:09.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>orb that's above it.

2063
01:47:09.742 --> 01:47:12.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we wanted to write Unix on

2064
01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:13.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>there, but AT&T wouldn't allow
that.

2065
01:47:13.735 --> 01:47:14.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there's wouldn't allow that.

2066
01:47:14.113 --> 01:47:15.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there's just a glowing orb in

2067
01:47:15.628 --> 01:47:17.153
<v Elisabetta Mori>the particular picture.

2068
01:47:18.203 --> 01:47:20.429
<v Elisabetta Mori>But the real thing was that I had

2069
01:47:20.449 --> 01:47:22.736
<v Elisabetta Mori>to have the right, we had to have
the rights to use it.

2070
01:47:22.781 --> 01:47:29.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what I actually did was I
had John sign a letter saying this

2071
01:47:29.855 --> 01:47:30.797
<v Elisabetta Mori>was a work for hire.

2072
01:47:31.987 --> 01:47:33.152
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I paid him a thousand

2073
01:47:33.192 --> 01:47:33.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>dollars.

2074
01:47:33.594 --> 01:47:33.651
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so dollars.

2075
01:47:33.651 --> 01:47:37.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so that's how I got this
document saying that, you know, I

2076
01:47:37.994 --> 01:47:41.749
<v Elisabetta Mori>had the ownership, which then
allowed me to do a copyright

2077
01:47:41.809 --> 01:47:45.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>filing with me as the copyright
holder so that holder so that I

2078
01:47:45.829 --> 01:47:47.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>could control how it got used.

2079
01:47:47.336 --> 01:47:47.396
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that's how that came about.

2080
01:47:47.396 --> 01:47:47.446
<v Elisabetta Mori>control how it got used.

2081
01:47:47.446 --> 01:47:47.506
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that's how that came about.

2082
01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:51.664
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then when we did the second
textbook, I wanted to again have,

2083
01:47:51.984 --> 01:48:02.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, something having to do
with the demon.

2084
01:48:02.834 --> 01:48:02.882
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the demon.

2085
01:48:02.882 --> 01:48:06.912
<v Elisabetta Mori>And by this time, John Lasseter

2086
01:48:07.253 --> 01:48:08.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>had gone over to Pixar.

2087
01:48:08.776 --> 01:48:08.862
<v Elisabetta Mori>Lucasfilm, when the third over to

2088
01:48:08.862 --> 01:48:08.872
<v Elisabetta Mori>Pixar.

2089
01:48:08.872 --> 01:48:09.443
<v Elisabetta Mori>Lucasfilm, when the third of the

2090
01:48:10.305 --> 01:48:15.847
<v Elisabetta Mori>three Star Wars movies was done,
Lucas suddenly had a lot less

2091
01:48:15.887 --> 01:48:16.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>money coming in.

2092
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.886
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he had to pare back a lot

2093
01:48:18.946 --> 01:48:22.056
<v Elisabetta Mori>of the stuff that he had built up
around those movies.

2094
01:48:22.056 --> 01:48:22.116
<v Elisabetta Mori>So one of the those movies.

2095
01:48:22.116 --> 01:48:23.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>So one of the things he did is he

2096
01:48:23.269 --> 01:48:24.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>wanted to get rid of Lucasfilm.

2097
01:48:24.433 --> 01:48:24.483
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, keep of Lucasfilm.

2098
01:48:24.483 --> 01:48:27.381
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, keep the technology they
developed, but, you know, he

2099
01:48:27.401 --> 01:48:29.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>didn't want to continue to pay for
that development.

2100
01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:30.844
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that got to Pixar.

2101
01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:32.825
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so John was there.

2102
01:48:33.501 --> 01:48:39.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course, John Lasseter's
thing was, he had always wanted to

2103
01:48:39.608 --> 01:48:41.763
<v Elisabetta Mori>do feature length animation movie,
computer computer generated one.

2104
01:48:43.301 --> 01:48:47.585
<v Elisabetta Mori>Pixar up to that point, they
didn't really have the resources

2105
01:48:47.605 --> 01:48:48.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do more than very short things.

2106
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:50.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>So they would do these three or

2107
01:48:50.862 --> 01:48:58.429
<v Elisabetta Mori>four minute films that would
appear at SIGGRAPH and their bread

2108
01:48:58.449 --> 01:49:01.478
<v Elisabetta Mori>and butter was TV commercials, you
know, 30 seconds.

2109
01:49:01.478 --> 01:49:01.578
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they got hooked up with
Disney, commercials, you know, 30

2110
01:49:01.578 --> 01:49:01.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>seconds.

2111
01:49:01.588 --> 01:49:01.648
<v Elisabetta Mori>But they got hooked up with

2112
01:49:01.648 --> 01:49:11.859
<v Elisabetta Mori>Disney, a contract with Disney to
do one of these films.

2113
01:49:11.859 --> 01:49:12.299
<v Elisabetta Mori>So Toy Story of these films.

2114
01:49:12.299 --> 01:49:13.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>So Toy Story was this, the first

2115
01:49:13.032 --> 01:49:13.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>one.

2116
01:49:13.112 --> 01:49:13.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>And one.

2117
01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:14.807
<v Elisabetta Mori>And John Lasseter was in charge of
that.

2118
01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:22.771
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he was phenomenally busy,
but I still wanted to get him to

2119
01:49:22.811 --> 01:49:24.518
<v Elisabetta Mori>draw another version of the demon.

2120
01:49:24.518 --> 01:49:24.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I actually got in touch with

2121
01:49:24.588 --> 01:49:24.628
<v Elisabetta Mori>version of the demon.

2122
01:49:24.628 --> 01:49:24.698
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I actually got in touch with

2123
01:49:24.698 --> 01:49:30.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>his second partner, actually got
in touch with his secretary, you

2124
01:49:30.911 --> 01:49:33.931
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, to sort of arrange the thing
happen.

2125
01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:37.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, she said, oh, we'll
do it.

2126
01:49:37.734 --> 01:49:37.784
<v Elisabetta Mori>And oh, we'll do it.

2127
01:49:37.784 --> 01:49:38.586
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we're getting closer and

2128
01:49:38.606 --> 01:49:40.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>closer to where we have to have
the thing for the book.

2129
01:49:40.301 --> 01:49:44.655
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, I'd learned that
flowers and chocolates are good

2130
01:49:44.695 --> 01:49:44.896
<v Elisabetta Mori>things.

2131
01:49:44.896 --> 01:49:45.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And whenever good things.

2132
01:49:45.686 --> 01:49:47.915
<v Elisabetta Mori>And whenever you come to visit, it
gets you favor.

2133
01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:51.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so she says, all right,
I'm going to get him to do it.

2134
01:49:51.916 --> 01:49:52.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, to get him to do it.

2135
01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:53.831
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, and so then I get a

2136
01:49:53.871 --> 01:49:55.257
<v Elisabetta Mori>call like a few days later.

2137
01:49:55.257 --> 01:49:55.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>I said, all a few days later.

2138
01:49:55.587 --> 01:49:56.371
<v Elisabetta Mori>I said, all right, he's done it.

2139
01:49:56.371 --> 01:49:56.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it.

2140
01:49:56.391 --> 01:49:58.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I said, oh, how do you get to
do it?

2141
01:49:58.862 --> 01:50:03.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>And with the paper and the inks
and the pens, and and I sat him

2142
01:50:03.586 --> 01:50:08.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>down at his desk and she said, he
said, he picked the pen up and

2143
01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:12.365
<v Elisabetta Mori>kind of dipped it and looked at
the paper and said, I haven't

2144
01:50:12.506 --> 01:50:14.594
<v Elisabetta Mori>drawn an animation in five years.

2145
01:50:14.594 --> 01:50:14.633
<v Elisabetta Mori>I years.

2146
01:50:14.633 --> 01:50:16.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't even know if I remember
how to do this.

2147
01:50:16.713 --> 01:50:19.019
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then to do this.

2148
01:50:19.019 --> 01:50:20.314
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then some short amount of time

2149
01:50:20.434 --> 01:50:21.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>did the whole thing, including the
whole thing, including filling in

2150
01:50:21.869 --> 01:50:22.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>all the colors.

2151
01:50:23.203 --> 01:50:27.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that second one is the demon.

2152
01:50:27.562 --> 01:50:31.445
<v Elisabetta Mori>Instead of just standing there
with the trident, he's decided

2153
01:50:31.465 --> 01:50:33.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>that he's going to try and skewer
that glowing orb.

2154
01:50:34.004 --> 01:50:37.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>So he's running after the glowing
orb, you know, trying to spear it

2155
01:50:37.869 --> 01:50:38.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>with his trident.

2156
01:50:38.532 --> 01:50:38.552
<v Elisabetta Mori>So trident.

2157
01:50:38.552 --> 01:50:41.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>So he's running along.

2158
01:50:41.015 --> 01:50:42.757
<v Elisabetta Mori>And along.

2159
01:50:42.757 --> 01:50:46.097
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we send this off to Addison
Wesley.

2160
01:50:46.746 --> 01:50:49.377
<v Elisabetta Mori>And now, of course, John Lasseter
is a famous person.

2161
01:50:49.377 --> 01:50:49.467
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when you look is a famous
person.

2162
01:50:49.467 --> 01:50:52.508
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when you look on that book, you
see that his signature is actually

2163
01:50:52.608 --> 01:50:55.405
<v Elisabetta Mori>still left underneath it on the
front cover.

2164
01:50:56.269 --> 01:50:57.835
<v Elisabetta Mori>And again, it's another work for
hire.

2165
01:50:57.835 --> 01:51:00.155
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I think I paid another thousand
dollars for that one.

2166
01:51:00.155 --> 01:51:00.243
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in particular, the glowing
dollars for that one.

2167
01:51:00.243 --> 01:51:05.967
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in particular, the glowing
orb, you know, it's going and it

2168
01:51:05.987 --> 01:51:07.674
<v Elisabetta Mori>had this little streak behind it.

2169
01:51:08.805 --> 01:51:11.031
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the people at Addison Wesley

2170
01:51:11.071 --> 01:51:12.967
<v Elisabetta Mori>decided that looked too much like
a sperm cell.

2171
01:51:12.967 --> 01:51:13.627
<v Elisabetta Mori>So like a sperm cell.

2172
01:51:13.627 --> 01:51:15.276
<v Elisabetta Mori>So they cut off that part.

2173
01:51:15.276 --> 01:51:15.336
<v Elisabetta Mori>So it's cut off that part.

2174
01:51:15.336 --> 01:51:17.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>So it's just this flying disc

2175
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.137
<v Elisabetta Mori>without quite so much stuff behind
it.

2176
01:51:19.137 --> 01:51:20.466
<v Elisabetta Mori>At any rate, so, you know, much
stuff behind it.

2177
01:51:20.466 --> 01:51:23.034
<v Elisabetta Mori>At any rate, so, you know, that
was the second book.

2178
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.759
<v Elisabetta Mori>Then the third book, we went back
and did the original demon on that

2179
01:51:28.879 --> 01:51:28.959
<v Elisabetta Mori>one.

2180
01:51:28.959 --> 01:51:29.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>That the original demon on that

2181
01:51:29.035 --> 01:51:29.045
<v Elisabetta Mori>one.

2182
01:51:29.045 --> 01:51:31.151
<v Elisabetta Mori>That was the first in the design

2183
01:51:31.191 --> 01:51:33.706
<v Elisabetta Mori>implementation of the FreeBSD
operating system series.

2184
01:51:33.706 --> 01:51:33.736
<v Elisabetta Mori>operating system series.

2185
01:51:34.269 --> 01:51:35.775
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then when we did the second

2186
01:51:35.835 --> 01:51:36.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>edition for that one, we actually
switched to the FreeBSD second

2187
01:51:36.788 --> 01:51:36.906
<v Elisabetta Mori>edition for that one, we actually
switched to the FreeBSD logo.

2188
01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.922
<v Elisabetta Mori>FreeBSD had been using the demon
as their logo, but the, there

2189
01:51:44.922 --> 01:51:49.475
<v Elisabetta Mori>there were issues among certain
people with religious beliefs that

2190
01:51:49.495 --> 01:51:49.836
<v Elisabetta Mori>they didn't like that.

2191
01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:49.906
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so a that they didn't like

2192
01:51:49.906 --> 01:51:49.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

2193
01:51:49.916 --> 01:51:50.544
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so a more stylized logo got

2194
01:51:50.564 --> 01:51:50.785
<v Elisabetta Mori>created.

2195
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.985
<v Elisabetta Mori>And NetBSD and OpenBSD have also

2196
01:51:56.025 --> 01:51:58.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>done their own logos at this
point.

2197
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.260
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the BSD demon is really just
sort of historically, BSD is not

2198
01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:02.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>really in wide use today.

2199
01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:07.681
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

2200
01:52:07.702 --> 01:52:13.658
<v Elisabetta Mori>So let's talk about completely
different and personal life.

2201
01:52:13.658 --> 01:52:13.698
<v Kirk McKusick>completely different personal
life.

2202
01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:16.808
<v Kirk McKusick>So let's talk about your private
life.

2203
01:52:20.283 --> 01:52:26.739
<v Kirk McKusick>So let's talk about, although it
still has to do with computers,

2204
01:52:26.739 --> 01:52:26.839
<v Kirk McKusick>look about your partner, Eric
Oman, do with computers, look

2205
01:52:26.839 --> 01:52:30.266
<v Kirk McKusick>about your partner, Eric Oman, and
how you came about to meet him.

2206
01:52:33.381 --> 01:52:34.005
<v Kirk McKusick>Yes, that's it.

2207
01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:42.954
<v Kirk McKusick>So I had, you know, throughout my

2208
01:52:42.974 --> 01:52:45.311
<v Kirk McKusick>life, I had interacted my life, I
had interacted sexually with other

2209
01:52:45.351 --> 01:52:48.989
<v Kirk McKusick>males, but I was not out as a gay
person.

2210
01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:54.474
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was sort of like, that was the
down-low or whatever they call

2211
01:52:54.715 --> 01:52:55.578
<v Elisabetta Mori>that sort of status quo.

2212
01:52:55.578 --> 01:52:55.618
<v Elisabetta Mori>call that status quo.

2213
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.068
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I was not out as a gay person.

2214
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.846
<v Elisabetta Mori>Like that was the down-low or

2215
01:53:00.906 --> 01:53:04.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>whatever they call that sort of,
you do it, but you pretend you

2216
01:53:04.628 --> 01:53:05.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>don't do it or something.

2217
01:53:06.684 --> 01:53:10.942
<v Elisabetta Mori>So when I got to Berkeley, which

2218
01:53:10.982 --> 01:53:15.703
<v Elisabetta Mori>would have been in 1976, the very
first semester I was there, I was

2219
01:53:15.743 --> 01:53:17.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>taking a class on databases.

2220
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:22.726
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And the class was taught by a

2221
01:53:22.726 --> 01:53:26.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>professor by a professor that was
working on the Ingress project.

2222
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:31.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, and Eric, as a, as a student
was hired to be working on the

2223
01:53:31.749 --> 01:53:32.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>Ingress project.

2224
01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:35.068
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course we used Ingress in

2225
01:53:35.168 --> 01:53:42.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>our, as the thing that we use for
our class assignments.

2226
01:53:42.335 --> 01:53:44.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so it turned And so it turned
out that Eric had been sort of

2227
01:53:44.627 --> 01:53:47.884
<v Elisabetta Mori>assigned as a TA to help the
students that were doing these

2228
01:53:47.924 --> 01:53:48.326
<v Elisabetta Mori>projects.

2229
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.704
<v Elisabetta Mori>So of course I was a student and

2230
01:53:50.724 --> 01:53:57.919
<v Elisabetta Mori>so he was, he was the TA that I
had.

2231
01:53:57.919 --> 01:53:58.065
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he started TA that I had.

2232
01:53:58.065 --> 01:53:58.828
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he started acting kind of

2233
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>nicely towards me, but me, but I
was kind of freaked out by this.

2234
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.406
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so I basically did not respond
well.

2235
01:54:09.802 --> 01:54:15.877
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the two of us kind of
ignored each other actively when

2236
01:54:15.897 --> 01:54:17.080
<v Elisabetta Mori>we would see each other in the
hallways, would other actively

2237
01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:17.667
<v Elisabetta Mori>when we would see each other in
the hallways, would turn and walk

2238
01:54:17.687 --> 01:54:18.088
<v Elisabetta Mori>the other way.

2239
01:54:20.983 --> 01:54:23.668
<v Elisabetta Mori>But after, so that was in 76.

2240
01:54:24.683 --> 01:54:27.604
<v Elisabetta Mori>We did interact a little bit with
each other, but it wasn't until

2241
01:54:27.604 --> 01:54:32.979
<v Elisabetta Mori>about 1979 where I was starting to
actually come out and be

2242
01:54:32.979 --> 01:54:33.029
<v Elisabetta Mori>acknowledged as a gay person.

2243
01:54:33.029 --> 01:54:33.109
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I had to actually come out and

2244
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.169
<v Elisabetta Mori>be acknowledged as a gay person.

2245
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:39.706
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I had gone to a, a meeting of

2246
01:54:39.766 --> 01:54:43.436
<v Elisabetta Mori>what was at the time called the UC
Gay People's Union.

2247
01:54:45.125 --> 01:54:49.696
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, and who should be on the
other side of that room, but Eric.

2248
01:54:50.443 --> 01:54:55.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we sort of connected up at
that point and started dating.

2249
01:54:57.505 --> 01:55:01.534
<v Elisabetta Mori>And neither of us had really had a
relationship that had managed to

2250
01:55:01.895 --> 01:55:05.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>succeed for more than about six
months.

2251
01:55:05.369 --> 01:55:07.963
<v Elisabetta Mori>But so we sort of, you know, said,
well, let's well, let's just start

2252
01:55:08.023 --> 01:55:08.665
<v Elisabetta Mori>this slowly.

2253
01:55:08.725 --> 01:55:10.210
<v Elisabetta Mori>Let's not start in bed.

2254
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:13.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>Let's start, you know, just doing
things together.

2255
01:55:14.424 --> 01:55:18.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that went on for a period of
time and eventually we decided,

2256
01:55:18.616 --> 01:55:20.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, this does in fact seem
to be working.

2257
01:55:20.653 --> 01:55:20.703
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we, be working.

2258
01:55:20.703 --> 01:55:25.126
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we, what we celebrate as

2259
01:55:25.206 --> 01:55:29.745
<v Elisabetta Mori>our anniversary date is the day
that we signed a lease together

2260
01:55:29.806 --> 01:55:30.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>for an apartment.

2261
01:55:31.732 --> 01:55:32.702
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in fact, there there were four

2262
01:55:32.742 --> 01:55:36.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>of us living in that apartment and
it was four bedrooms.

2263
01:55:36.113 --> 01:55:38.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And we, Eric and I actually
had our own bedrooms.

2264
01:55:40.165 --> 01:55:42.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>But that was 18th of 1979 was when
we moved in.

2265
01:55:45.664 --> 01:55:49.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we had been through enough of
these things in the past where,

2266
01:55:49.954 --> 01:55:52.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, the hardest part of
these relationships is the

2267
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:53.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>breaking up part.

2268
01:55:53.253 --> 01:55:53.511
<v Elisabetta Mori>Cause part.

2269
01:55:53.511 --> 01:55:55.086
<v Elisabetta Mori>Cause at that point you just
pissed off.

2270
01:55:56.010 --> 01:56:01.312
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you know, especially if you've
intermingled your belongings, then

2271
01:56:01.352 --> 01:56:02.134
<v Elisabetta Mori>it's like, that's mine.

2272
01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:03.464
<v Elisabetta Mori>No, it's mine.

2273
01:56:03.845 --> 01:56:08.080
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we went out to the, you know,
the day we moved in together, we

2274
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:11.371
<v Elisabetta Mori>went out to the stationery store
and we bought these rolls of red

2275
01:56:11.411 --> 01:56:16.773
<v Elisabetta Mori>and yellow dots, little tiny, you
know, eight millimeter size dots.

2276
01:56:17.421 --> 01:56:20.872
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I put a yellow dot on every
book and every record and every,

2277
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:21.966
<v Elisabetta Mori>everything that was mine.

2278
01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:23.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he put a red dot on all the

2279
01:56:23.685 --> 01:56:26.561
<v Elisabetta Mori>things that were his so that when
the time for the breakup came,

2280
01:56:26.581 --> 01:56:28.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>there was no argument.

2281
01:56:28.086 --> 01:56:29.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>If it had a yellow dot, it was

2282
01:56:29.391 --> 01:56:29.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>mine.

2283
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.104
<v Elisabetta Mori>If it had a red dot, it was his.

2284
01:56:32.349 --> 01:56:35.528
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, well, I guess that
must've been fairly successful

2285
01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:40.170
<v Elisabetta Mori>because we, um, eventually we
moved to another place.

2286
01:56:40.190 --> 01:56:46.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and then in 1986 we actually
bought that from the landlord.

2287
01:56:46.495 --> 01:56:52.736
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, Uh, so our second anniversary
sort of date is the date we

2288
01:56:52.997 --> 01:56:55.327
<v Elisabetta Mori>co-signed the, the the date we
co-signed the, the paperwork to

2289
01:56:55.367 --> 01:56:56.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>buy the house together.

2290
01:56:57.873 --> 01:56:59.556
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, of course you, I mean,

2291
01:57:00.043 --> 01:57:01.327
<v Elisabetta Mori>you couldn't really buy it
jointly.

2292
01:57:01.367 --> 01:57:03.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we each had, you know,
percentage, 50% ownership.

2293
01:57:03.605 --> 01:57:03.625
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, 50% ownership.

2294
01:57:03.625 --> 01:57:09.269
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and, uh, so that was sort of

2295
01:57:09.309 --> 01:57:11.734
<v Elisabetta Mori>the second anniversary that we
have.

2296
01:57:12.536 --> 01:57:20.551
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, then in 1992, the city of
Berkeley started recognizing

2297
01:57:20.612 --> 01:57:21.715
<v Elisabetta Mori>domestic partnership.

2298
01:57:21.715 --> 01:57:25.323
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, uh, And so, uh, you could

2299
01:57:25.624 --> 01:57:28.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>get a domestic partnership
certificate from the city of

2300
01:57:28.954 --> 01:57:31.909
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley, uh, uh, and if you were
a city employee, you, that was

2301
01:57:31.969 --> 01:57:34.044
<v Elisabetta Mori>actually beneficial because you
could, you know, get health

2302
01:57:34.104 --> 01:57:35.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>insurance coverage and so on.

2303
01:57:35.469 --> 01:57:36.762
<v Elisabetta Mori>Like you would, if you were a

2304
01:57:36.802 --> 01:57:39.973
<v Elisabetta Mori>married couple, but neither of us
of course work for the city of

2305
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.361
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berkeley.

2306
01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:41.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>So for us, it was really nothing

2307
01:57:41.608 --> 01:57:44.688
<v Elisabetta Mori>more than a piece of paper, but it
still gave us an opportunity to

2308
01:57:44.729 --> 01:57:46.053
<v Elisabetta Mori>have a wedding ceremony.

2309
01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.126
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we did that on Eric's mom's

2310
01:57:48.186 --> 01:57:51.702
<v Elisabetta Mori>deck, uh, which has a, had a view
of, you view of, you know,

2311
01:57:51.802 --> 01:57:54.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>panoramic view of the Bay area of
the Bay.

2312
01:57:54.068 --> 01:57:57.708
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and then we, but it could only
hold about 25 people.

2313
01:57:58.402 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we just had sort of a core of
people there.

2314
01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:05.160
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then we retired back to our
house, um, for the reception, the

2315
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>party afterwards, uh, where we had
about a hundred people.

2316
01:58:08.602 --> 01:58:12.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we in fact had a friend that
ran a Japanese restaurant.

2317
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:15.212
<v Elisabetta Mori>So he set up a sushi bar in our
living room and was serving sushi

2318
01:58:15.232 --> 01:58:15.742
<v Elisabetta Mori>to everybody.

2319
01:58:15.742 --> 01:58:15.742
<v Elisabetta Mori>everybody.

2320
01:58:16.785 --> 01:58:20.214
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, so, and then we got people
there that were like, you know,

2321
01:58:20.214 --> 01:58:21.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>well, you know, well, where's the
ceremony?

2322
01:58:21.184 --> 01:58:23.241
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's like, well, if we did that
earlier and you know, well, well,

2323
01:58:23.261 --> 01:58:24.708
<v Elisabetta Mori>yeah, well, I wasn't invited.

2324
01:58:24.728 --> 01:58:25.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's like, well, you know,

2325
01:58:25.532 --> 01:58:26.325
<v Elisabetta Mori>that was you know, that was the
boring part.

2326
01:58:26.345 --> 01:58:28.561
<v Elisabetta Mori>We figured you just want to come
to the party, but we got a lot of

2327
01:58:28.862 --> 01:58:29.825
<v Elisabetta Mori>pushback about that.

2328
01:58:29.885 --> 01:58:32.713
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, at any rate, um, so we,

2329
01:58:34.083 --> 01:58:37.421
<v Elisabetta Mori>and we did that of course on May
18th because we're, you know, I'm

2330
01:58:37.461 --> 01:58:39.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>terrible at remembering dates and
things.

2331
01:58:39.329 --> 01:58:42.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, it's gotta be
like one thing to remember, not

2332
01:58:42.307 --> 01:58:43.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>like which of 10 it is.

2333
01:58:44.635 --> 01:58:45.604
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so that carried on.

2334
01:58:45.704 --> 01:58:52.027
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then, uh, around 99, I think,
uh, the state of California

2335
01:58:52.087 --> 01:58:55.864
<v Elisabetta Mori>recognized domestic partnership
and gave you the benefits like,

2336
01:58:56.668 --> 01:58:58.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, tax benefits and other
things that you would get, of

2337
01:58:59.090 --> 01:59:00.363
<v Elisabetta Mori>course, not the federal one.

2338
01:59:00.383 --> 01:59:03.111
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so we did that also on May

2339
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:03.171
<v Elisabetta Mori>18th.

2340
01:59:03.191 --> 01:59:10.035
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and then, uh, the, uh,

2341
01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:15.846
<v Elisabetta Mori>California Supreme Court passed a
thing that basically said the, you

2342
01:59:15.846 --> 01:59:19.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, said the, you know, the, the
state has to recognize marriage,

2343
01:59:20.313 --> 01:59:23.968
<v Elisabetta Mori>um, and, you know, give the
marriage privileges, uh, and that

2344
01:59:24.329 --> 01:59:28.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>the, the Supreme Court rulings,
both state and federal all seem to

2345
01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:29.672
<v Elisabetta Mori>come out in June.

2346
01:59:30.274 --> 01:59:31.565
<v Elisabetta Mori>And sure enough, this one came out

2347
01:59:31.605 --> 01:59:32.528
<v Elisabetta Mori>sometime in June.

2348
01:59:32.548 --> 01:59:38.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, I said to Eric and Eric's

2349
01:59:38.130 --> 01:59:39.714
<v Elisabetta Mori>like, Oh, we need to get married.

2350
01:59:40.215 --> 01:59:41.404
<v Elisabetta Mori>I'm like, yeah, but you know,

2351
01:59:42.006 --> 01:59:45.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>we've missed May 18th and I can't
be, you know, some other day.

2352
01:59:46.083 --> 01:59:50.016
<v Elisabetta Mori>And besides which next May 18th is
going to be our 30th anniversary.

2353
01:59:50.063 --> 01:59:52.650
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that'll be the perfect scenario
for that.

2354
01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:56.667
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we start, you know, planning
for that and so on and so forth.

2355
01:59:57.429 --> 02:00:01.709
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then of course in November,
they November, they passed

2356
02:00:01.769 --> 02:00:06.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>proposition eight in California,
which banned gay marriage

2357
02:00:06.190 --> 02:00:07.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>recognition in California.

2358
02:00:08.204 --> 02:00:09.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>So anyone had gotten married in

2359
02:00:09.648 --> 02:00:11.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>that window between June and
November 2nd, uh, November 2nd,

2360
02:00:11.926 --> 02:00:15.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>uh, could remain married, but no
new ones could happen.

2361
02:00:15.615 --> 02:00:22.145
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so of course our plans to
get married on, you know, our our

2362
02:00:22.165 --> 02:00:24.055
<v Elisabetta Mori>30th anniversary are gone.

2363
02:00:25.105 --> 02:00:28.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>So time rolls forward and, uh,

2364
02:00:28.994 --> 02:00:35.548
<v Elisabetta Mori>then the, the federal Supreme
Court basically, uh, ruled that

2365
02:00:35.849 --> 02:00:37.735
<v Elisabetta Mori>proposition eight was invalid.

2366
02:00:38.944 --> 02:00:43.075
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so that ruling of course came

2367
02:00:43.135 --> 02:00:49.253
<v Elisabetta Mori>down in June and, uh, Eric is
like, all right, now we really

2368
02:00:49.273 --> 02:00:50.135
<v Elisabetta Mori>have to go out and get married.

2369
02:00:50.135 --> 02:00:52.367
<v Elisabetta Mori>I I said, but next May 18th is

2370
02:00:52.387 --> 02:00:53.953
<v Elisabetta Mori>going to be our 35th anniversary.

2371
02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:54.983
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's going to be perfect.

2372
02:00:55.425 --> 02:00:56.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>And Eric's like, you fooled me
once.

2373
02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>You're not fooling me twice.

2374
02:00:58.204 --> 02:00:59.168
<v Elisabetta Mori>We're going out and we're getting

2375
02:00:59.188 --> 02:01:00.012
<v Elisabetta Mori>married now.

2376
02:01:01.124 --> 02:01:02.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we actually ended up getting

2377
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.791
<v Elisabetta Mori>married.

2378
02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:04.746
<v Elisabetta Mori>We picked his mother's birthday in

2379
02:01:04.827 --> 02:01:05.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>October to do it.

2380
02:01:06.822 --> 02:01:08.226
<v Elisabetta Mori>And we just did a little ceremony

2381
02:01:08.266 --> 02:01:11.335
<v Elisabetta Mori>with just her and the minister.

2382
02:01:11.501 --> 02:01:13.327
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, you know, we needed one

2383
02:01:13.367 --> 02:01:14.150
<v Elisabetta Mori>other person, I guess.

2384
02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:16.944
<v Elisabetta Mori>So our tenant, uh, and and then we

2385
02:01:16.964 --> 02:01:18.027
<v Elisabetta Mori>went out and had a nice dinner.

2386
02:01:18.749 --> 02:01:21.786
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so then, uh, legally it's, you

2387
02:01:21.786 --> 02:01:29.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>it's, you know, October 26th, but
we a big fancy ass wedding, um, on

2388
02:01:29.665 --> 02:01:31.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>May 18th of the following year.

2389
02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:34.429
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, much to my chagrin, uh,

2390
02:01:35.361 --> 02:01:38.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>neither Eric's or my Wikipedia
pages will allow us to put that

2391
02:01:38.331 --> 02:01:39.441
<v Elisabetta Mori>May 18th date down.

2392
02:01:39.481 --> 02:01:40.826
<v Elisabetta Mori>They insist that we have to have

2393
02:01:40.906 --> 02:01:43.675
<v Elisabetta Mori>October 26th as our wedding day.

2394
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:48.515
<v Kirk McKusick>By the way, I think this is a, you

2395
02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Kirk McKusick>know, like there's the big
difference between like now and

2396
02:01:52.751 --> 02:01:53.919
<v Kirk McKusick>what happened in 1981.

2397
02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:54.862
<v Kirk McKusick>So we mentioned briefly, uh,

2398
02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:04.123
<v Kirk McKusick>earlier that you were working for
the UAC aircraft in, uh, Los

2399
02:02:04.224 --> 02:02:10.428
<v Kirk McKusick>Angeles and that eventually, and
and probably luckily for us, you

2400
02:02:10.488 --> 02:02:13.676
<v Kirk McKusick>had to go and work.

2401
02:02:14.404 --> 02:02:14.584
<v Kirk McKusick>Yeah.

2402
02:02:14.704 --> 02:02:15.226
<v Kirk McKusick>Elsewhere.

2403
02:02:15.246 --> 02:02:18.803
<v Kirk McKusick>If you want to briefly say, what

2404
02:02:19.084 --> 02:02:21.794
<v Kirk McKusick>was the situation at the time?
So the story at the time?

2405
02:02:21.794 --> 02:02:33.088
<v Kirk McKusick>So the story is that, um, up until
1976, uh, gay people could not get

2406
02:02:33.249 --> 02:02:35.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>security clearances beyond very
minimal ones.

2407
02:02:35.776 --> 02:02:35.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, minimal ones.

2408
02:02:35.816 --> 02:02:40.174
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, I mean, at Hughes

2409
02:02:40.255 --> 02:02:44.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>Aircraft, we were working on
military stuff.

2410
02:02:45.043 --> 02:02:48.254
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so you had to have fairly
significant security clearances to

2411
02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:48.655
<v Elisabetta Mori>do that.

2412
02:02:48.655 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, well, to do Uh, well, well,

2413
02:02:51.762 --> 02:02:57.347
<v Elisabetta Mori>when Jimmy Carter was elected
president, um, um, he said, well,

2414
02:02:59.481 --> 02:03:03.053
<v Elisabetta Mori>why is it this rule that gay
people can't have clearances?

2415
02:03:04.424 --> 02:03:08.723
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the, uh, you know, the answer
came back, well, you know, they

2416
02:03:08.743 --> 02:03:11.867
<v Elisabetta Mori>could be blackmailed and, you
know, and and be forced to give

2417
02:03:11.907 --> 02:03:13.052
<v Elisabetta Mori>away information he said.

2418
02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.387
<v Elisabetta Mori>So if they could prove that they

2419
02:03:15.468 --> 02:03:20.381
<v Elisabetta Mori>wouldn't, couldn't be blackmailed,
then wouldn't it, you know, would

2420
02:03:20.401 --> 02:03:22.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>there be any other reason that
they couldn't have a clearance?

2421
02:03:23.341 --> 02:03:25.550
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they're, well, I guess not.

2422
02:03:25.951 --> 02:03:27.906
<v Elisabetta Mori>He said, so you need to come up

2423
02:03:27.966 --> 02:03:30.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>with some way of letting them
prove that they won't be

2424
02:03:30.595 --> 02:03:31.284
<v Elisabetta Mori>blackmailed.

2425
02:03:31.284 --> 02:03:31.304
<v Elisabetta Mori>be blackmailed.

2426
02:03:31.364 --> 02:03:35.544
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, if they can pass
that test, then you need to issue

2427
02:03:35.604 --> 02:03:36.808
<v Elisabetta Mori>security clearances to them.

2428
02:03:37.951 --> 02:03:39.295
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, okay.

2429
02:03:39.295 --> 02:03:42.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, Uh, so I needed security
clearance.

2430
02:03:42.588 --> 02:03:46.965
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, uh, you know, I, I,
obviously I was gay.

2431
02:03:47.025 --> 02:03:48.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>I wasn't, you know, trying to hide
that.

2432
02:03:48.690 --> 02:03:54.051
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, uh, they, you know, the,
the, the way you convince them,

2433
02:03:54.071 --> 02:03:59.984
<v Elisabetta Mori>uh, and this, this, this, this,
and again, and and sort of an

2434
02:04:00.005 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>interesting thing, uh, this is
what I was told and what I did by

2435
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:04.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>Hughes Aircraft.

2436
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.164
<v Elisabetta Mori>It turned out when I later was

2437
02:04:06.204 --> 02:04:08.804
<v Elisabetta Mori>talking to some security folks
just in the last few years, I

2438
02:04:08.824 --> 02:04:10.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>said, no, that was never the rule.

2439
02:04:10.492 --> 02:04:12.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, they just thought made

2440
02:04:12.046 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>that up as a way to do it.

2441
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:15.268
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, um, at um, at any rate, what

2442
02:04:15.288 --> 02:04:18.991
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was, you I was, you have to take
out an ad in the local newspaper

2443
02:04:19.452 --> 02:04:23.444
<v Elisabetta Mori>in the classified section saying I
comma your full name, declare

2444
02:04:23.464 --> 02:04:26.153
<v Elisabetta Mori>myself to be a homosexual and run
that ad.

2445
02:04:26.582 --> 02:04:29.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>And if you're willing to do that,
then you won't be black.

2446
02:04:29.212 --> 02:04:31.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, you can't be blackmailed
because obviously you don't care.

2447
02:04:31.733 --> 02:04:31.832
<v Elisabetta Mori>So you don't care.

2448
02:04:31.832 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>So the local newspaper for me was

2449
02:04:34.331 --> 02:04:35.675
<v Elisabetta Mori>the Los Angeles times.

2450
02:04:36.523 --> 02:04:38.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I dutifully went and ran the

2451
02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:42.498
<v Elisabetta Mori>ad for a day and went and bought
the paper and tore out the ad.

2452
02:04:42.498 --> 02:04:42.578
<v Elisabetta Mori>and bought the paper tore out the
ad.

2453
02:04:44.321 --> 02:04:47.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>And that got stapled to the other
20 pages of my application and I

2454
02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:49.504
<v Elisabetta Mori>got all my clearances.

2455
02:04:50.868 --> 02:04:53.696
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, being the cheapskate that

2456
02:04:53.716 --> 02:04:54.007
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was, I didn't buy two copies.

2457
02:04:54.007 --> 02:04:54.057
<v Elisabetta Mori>cheapskate I didn't buy two

2458
02:04:54.057 --> 02:04:54.067
<v Elisabetta Mori>copies.

2459
02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.588
<v Elisabetta Mori>I just bought one and I gave away

2460
02:04:56.648 --> 02:04:59.724
<v Elisabetta Mori>the only part of it that was, you
know, necessary.

2461
02:04:59.744 --> 02:05:03.575
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so many years later I went
back to try and find it.

2462
02:05:03.575 --> 02:05:03.615
<v Elisabetta Mori>And and find it.

2463
02:05:03.615 --> 02:05:05.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it turns out that, you know,

2464
02:05:05.048 --> 02:05:07.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>they scanned in all the papers,
but they didn't bother with the

2465
02:05:07.726 --> 02:05:10.444
<v Elisabetta Mori>classified section because, you
know, who who cared about that?

2466
02:05:11.306 --> 02:05:14.636
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so I've never been able to
find it.

2467
02:05:14.636 --> 02:05:14.656
<v Elisabetta Mori>I it.

2468
02:05:14.656 --> 02:05:15.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't really know what the date

2469
02:05:16.046 --> 02:05:17.672
<v Elisabetta Mori>was and you know, et cetera.

2470
02:05:17.892 --> 02:05:19.985
<v Elisabetta Mori>So it, it would require a great

2471
02:05:20.005 --> 02:05:21.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>deal of effort to go find it.

2472
02:05:21.610 --> 02:05:24.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>But nevertheless, um, you know, I

2473
02:05:24.946 --> 02:05:28.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>got my clearances and the, the
the, the clearances are high

2474
02:05:28.889 --> 02:05:30.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>enough that you're, you're you're,
you're not even allowed to say

2475
02:05:30.648 --> 02:05:31.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>what the name of the clearances
are.

2476
02:05:31.914 --> 02:05:31.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's craziness.

2477
02:05:31.934 --> 02:05:32.044
<v Elisabetta Mori>But of the clearances are.

2478
02:05:32.044 --> 02:05:32.064
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's craziness.

2479
02:05:32.064 --> 02:05:37.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>But anyway, um, so I got that and

2480
02:05:37.409 --> 02:05:42.309
<v Elisabetta Mori>I was like this rising star
because, uh, they needed this,

2481
02:05:42.610 --> 02:05:47.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>this board design, uh, and
anything that ends up going out

2482
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:52.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>into space, uh, has to be, you
know, small, lightweight, not very

2483
02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:58.834
<v Elisabetta Mori>big, uh, radiation hardened parts,
uh, low power, et cetera, et

2484
02:05:58.874 --> 02:05:59.175
<v Elisabetta Mori>cetera.

2485
02:05:59.235 --> 02:06:01.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, um, um, the way these things

2486
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:05.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>had been done, they were all
discrete component, uh, stuff.

2487
02:06:05.214 --> 02:06:06.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>And I said, well, you know, we
well, you know, we have these

2488
02:06:06.849 --> 02:06:07.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>things called microprocessors.

2489
02:06:07.994 --> 02:06:08.767
<v Elisabetta Mori>I can I can just drop a

2490
02:06:08.807 --> 02:06:11.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>microprocessor in a couple of
peripheral chips and a memory chip

2491
02:06:11.267 --> 02:06:13.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>and you chips and a memory chip
and you know, we can do everything

2492
02:06:13.128 --> 02:06:13.489
<v Elisabetta Mori>you need.

2493
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:15.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so did that.

2494
02:06:15.876 --> 02:06:18.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, you know, so did And, uh,
you know, so came in under budget

2495
02:06:18.647 --> 02:06:19.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>on power and everything else.

2496
02:06:20.733 --> 02:06:23.227
<v Elisabetta Mori>And furthermore, um, um, you know,

2497
02:06:23.247 --> 02:06:25.434
<v Elisabetta Mori>they, they, the specs for things
would change.

2498
02:06:25.434 --> 02:06:25.471
<v Elisabetta Mori>So one change.

2499
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:26.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>So one of the things I had to do

2500
02:06:26.506 --> 02:06:27.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>was uplinks and data.

2501
02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:28.391
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they said, well, the, well,

2502
02:06:28.391 --> 02:06:31.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>the, the, we've been told the
uplink data is changing from odd

2503
02:06:31.311 --> 02:06:32.502
<v Elisabetta Mori>parody to even parody.

2504
02:06:32.522 --> 02:06:33.867
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't know how long, how much

2505
02:06:33.967 --> 02:06:35.482
<v Elisabetta Mori>it's going to take to, you know,
fix that.

2506
02:06:35.944 --> 02:06:38.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>Well, for me, it was like, you
know, three lines of code and blow

2507
02:06:38.547 --> 02:06:39.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>a new chip and put it in there.

2508
02:06:39.693 --> 02:06:39.732
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it in there.

2509
02:06:39.732 --> 02:06:41.570
<v Elisabetta Mori>But you don't want to admit that
it's that easy.

2510
02:06:41.650 --> 02:06:45.471
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, you know, I gave them a week
and got a week of surfing while I

2511
02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:46.464
<v Elisabetta Mori>waited for the week to go by.

2512
02:06:46.464 --> 02:06:46.541
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, at any rate, week to go by.

2513
02:06:46.541 --> 02:06:52.287
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, at any rate, uh, uh, all was
going well.

2514
02:06:52.608 --> 02:06:54.180
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, you know, and and so on.

2515
02:06:54.461 --> 02:06:56.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I was this kind of rising star.

2516
02:06:57.092 --> 02:07:01.813
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and then Ronald Reagan got
elected and turned out that Jimmy

2517
02:07:01.853 --> 02:07:03.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>Carter, it was just an executive
order.

2518
02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.872
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in the very first week that
Ronald Reagan was in office and

2519
02:07:07.892 --> 02:07:08.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>did that order.

2520
02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:09.533
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, order.

2521
02:07:09.533 --> 02:07:14.115
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so suddenly I come into work
and I can't even go to my desk

2522
02:07:14.195 --> 02:07:16.166
<v Elisabetta Mori>because my desk is in a classified
area.

2523
02:07:17.088 --> 02:07:21.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, uh, you know, they bring
my personal stuff out from the

2524
02:07:21.929 --> 02:07:24.124
<v Elisabetta Mori>desk and give it to me and say,
you know, but, you know, we'll

2525
02:07:24.164 --> 02:07:26.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>find things for you to do and, you
know, blah, blah, blah.

2526
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.810
<v Elisabetta Mori>But it was very clear to me that
that chosen career path was not

2527
02:07:31.131 --> 02:07:32.744
<v Elisabetta Mori>really gonna be happening.

2528
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.888
<v Elisabetta Mori>So that's when I turned to

2529
02:07:35.908 --> 02:07:53.411
<v Elisabetta Mori>focusing on no more So, uh, um,
let's go back to, um, your

2530
02:07:53.451 --> 02:07:53.872
<v Kirk McKusick>husband.

2531
02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:58.813
<v Kirk McKusick>So you made a choice of, uh,

2532
02:07:59.561 --> 02:08:03.394
<v Kirk McKusick>raising four to having four sons,
right?

2533
02:08:03.394 --> 02:08:06.212
<v Kirk McKusick>So So can you, would you like to
talk about it?

2534
02:08:07.744 --> 02:08:13.378
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we had this notion that it
would be fun to adopt kids and

2535
02:08:13.418 --> 02:08:13.839
<v Elisabetta Mori>raise them.

2536
02:08:13.839 --> 02:08:13.919
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, but at, in the, the to

2537
02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:13.969
<v Elisabetta Mori>adopt kids and raise them.

2538
02:08:13.969 --> 02:08:14.039
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, but at, in the, the

2539
02:08:14.039 --> 02:08:23.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>1980s, it was not possible for gay
couples to adopt at all.

2540
02:08:24.526 --> 02:08:25.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>End of story.

2541
02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:27.628
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, we had to find some other

2542
02:08:27.668 --> 02:08:28.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>way of making this work.

2543
02:08:30.307 --> 02:08:33.804
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, quite honestly, I I are

2544
02:08:33.844 --> 02:08:37.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>particularly good at dealing with
what I'll call the larval stage.

2545
02:08:38.315 --> 02:08:42.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so until we can sort of
interact and talk and so on with

2546
02:08:42.432 --> 02:08:45.751
<v Elisabetta Mori>the kids, you know, we're we're
that, that's kind of where we're

2547
02:08:45.771 --> 02:08:47.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>ready to start working on it.

2548
02:08:47.036 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, then the sort of five to

2549
02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:47.166
<v Elisabetta Mori>10, to start working on it.

2550
02:08:47.166 --> 02:08:47.428
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, then the sort of five to

2551
02:08:47.428 --> 02:08:54.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>10, um, you know, we enjoy
interacting with the kids, but

2552
02:08:54.371 --> 02:08:58.409
<v Elisabetta Mori>again, it's not really our, our,
our sweet spot.

2553
02:08:58.429 --> 02:09:01.967
<v Elisabetta Mori>Our sweet spot is really sort of
10 to 18, um, where they're,

2554
02:09:02.148 --> 02:09:04.966
<v Elisabetta Mori>they're starting to pull away from
their parents, but they still want

2555
02:09:05.026 --> 02:09:07.916
<v Elisabetta Mori>and need adult supervision, but it
can't be their parents.

2556
02:09:07.916 --> 02:09:08.006
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so that, that, can't be
their parents.

2557
02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:12.634
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so that, that, that's the
area where we were really able to

2558
02:09:12.714 --> 02:09:13.036
<v Elisabetta Mori>focus.

2559
02:09:13.036 --> 02:09:13.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so able to focus.

2560
02:09:13.114 --> 02:09:16.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what we ended up doing is,
uh, we, we we, we had friends that

2561
02:09:16.526 --> 02:09:20.587
<v Elisabetta Mori>had kids, uh, and you know, we we
were interacting with them while

2562
02:09:20.607 --> 02:09:24.244
<v Elisabetta Mori>the kids were starting to grow up
and you know, the kids liked us

2563
02:09:24.305 --> 02:09:27.546
<v Elisabetta Mori>and we liked the kids and the
parents were copacetic with having

2564
02:09:27.686 --> 02:09:29.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>us, you know, take care of their
kids.

2565
02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:30.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of their kids.

2566
02:09:30.093 --> 02:09:31.749
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what ended up happening was

2567
02:09:31.769 --> 02:09:34.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>the kids would come and spend
their summer with us.

2568
02:09:35.269 --> 02:09:38.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>And since I was self-employed, I
could control my schedule so that

2569
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:40.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>I would basically just take
summers off.

2570
02:09:40.816 --> 02:09:40.846
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so off.

2571
02:09:40.846 --> 02:09:43.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so it was just, you know, for,

2572
02:09:43.531 --> 02:09:47.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>for three months, all I was doing
was interacting with the kids and,

2573
02:09:47.712 --> 02:09:50.248
<v Elisabetta Mori>uh, you know, we'd we'd go on
these massive long trips.

2574
02:09:50.309 --> 02:09:55.191
<v Elisabetta Mori>So we'd go, you know, fly down to
Australia and spend the entire

2575
02:09:55.252 --> 02:09:59.871
<v Elisabetta Mori>summer driving around the parts of
Australia or New Zealand and spend

2576
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:04.210
<v Elisabetta Mori>the entire summer cruising around
New Zealand and doing stuff and,

2577
02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:06.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>or Europe or the U S I mean, we
did all kinds of places.

2578
02:10:06.889 --> 02:10:14.249
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, and uh, and the upshot of
that is then that, uh, three of

2579
02:10:14.329 --> 02:10:16.816
<v Elisabetta Mori>the four kids were only, only
children.

2580
02:10:16.816 --> 02:10:16.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>And only children.

2581
02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the parents actually got

2582
02:10:18.287 --> 02:10:20.595
<v Elisabetta Mori>the whole summer off from their
teenage kids.

2583
02:10:21.409 --> 02:10:23.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and they, they thought that
was pretty cool and we thought it

2584
02:10:23.929 --> 02:10:24.712
<v Elisabetta Mori>was very cool.

2585
02:10:24.772 --> 02:10:27.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, so, um, so, you know, it,

2586
02:10:27.707 --> 02:10:28.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>it worked out quite well.

2587
02:10:29.452 --> 02:10:30.823
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then of course, at around 18,

2588
02:10:30.823 --> 02:10:34.203
<v Elisabetta Mori>of course, at around 18, you know,
all adults become stupid, um, and

2589
02:10:34.444 --> 02:10:36.510
<v Elisabetta Mori>you don't really hear from them
much unless they need money.

2590
02:10:37.312 --> 02:10:39.887
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, uh, but then somewhere
around 21 or so, they, they,

2591
02:10:41.441 --> 02:10:44.591
<v Elisabetta Mori>suddenly your intelligence returns
and they reconnect with you on

2592
02:10:44.632 --> 02:10:47.809
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of a peer to peer, as opposed
to a parent child relationship.

2593
02:10:47.929 --> 02:10:53.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>So in fact, you know, it's worked
out extremely well for us and, and

2594
02:10:53.934 --> 02:10:54.475
<v Elisabetta Mori>for the kids.

2595
02:10:54.475 --> 02:10:54.495
<v Elisabetta Mori>Sounds nice.

2596
02:10:54.495 --> 02:10:54.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>the kids.

2597
02:10:54.515 --> 02:10:54.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>Sounds nice.

2598
02:10:58.110 --> 02:11:00.883
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, we probably haven't
mentioned, um, why, I mean, I, I,

2599
02:11:03.381 --> 02:11:06.931
<v Kirk McKusick>I just introduced the fact that
your husband has to do with

2600
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:14.404
<v Kirk McKusick>computers, but I haven't really
said, uh, what, why he's like he's

2601
02:11:14.424 --> 02:11:16.830
<v Kirk McKusick>famous computing due to send mail.

2602
02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:21.030
<v Kirk McKusick>Would you like to just briefly

2603
02:11:21.090 --> 02:11:22.073
<v Kirk McKusick>fill in that?
Yes.

2604
02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:29.217
<v Kirk McKusick>So, um, I think I mentioned
originally that Eric was working

2605
02:11:29.237 --> 02:11:29.979
<v Kirk McKusick>on the Ingress project.

2606
02:11:29.979 --> 02:11:30.059
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and, uh, part of that was, uh,

2607
02:11:30.059 --> 02:11:34.741
<v Elisabetta Mori>Eric was working on the Um, and,
uh, part of that was, uh, that the

2608
02:11:34.761 --> 02:11:39.774
<v Elisabetta Mori>Ingress project actually had the
first ARPANET connection on

2609
02:11:39.794 --> 02:11:39.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>campus.

2610
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.325
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, so all of the, anyone

2611
02:11:45.345 --> 02:11:49.020
<v Elisabetta Mori>that wanted to do anything with,
on the ARPANET, you know, had to

2612
02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:49.426
<v Elisabetta Mori>essentially have an account
anything with, on the ARPANET, you

2613
02:11:49.426 --> 02:11:50.189
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, had to essentially have an
account on that machine.

2614
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:53.545
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and you know, they, that was
proving to be very difficult.

2615
02:11:53.565 --> 02:11:58.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, the machine was a research
machine and it wasn't really

2616
02:11:59.050 --> 02:12:02.267
<v Elisabetta Mori>supposed to be like a general
machine for people to do stuff on.

2617
02:12:02.287 --> 02:12:04.281
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, but he kept getting, you
know, all this push.

2618
02:12:04.301 --> 02:12:05.266
<v Elisabetta Mori>Oh, I need an account.

2619
02:12:05.306 --> 02:12:05.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>Blah, blah, blah.

2620
02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:09.514
<v Elisabetta Mori>So really what they needed is
because they wanted to be able to

2621
02:12:09.534 --> 02:12:09.915
<v Elisabetta Mori>send and receive a letter, send
and to be able to send and receive

2622
02:12:09.915 --> 02:12:12.044
<v Elisabetta Mori>a letter, send and receive an
email, but really what they needed

2623
02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:14.481
<v Elisabetta Mori>is because they wanted to be able
to send and receive electronic

2624
02:12:14.541 --> 02:12:14.822
<v Elisabetta Mori>mail.

2625
02:12:15.744 --> 02:12:18.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what Eric said was, well,

2626
02:12:18.713 --> 02:12:23.111
<v Elisabetta Mori>okay, what I'll do is I will just
write this sort of post office

2627
02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:28.492
<v Elisabetta Mori>kind of program that will accept
mail off the local Berkeley

2628
02:12:28.532 --> 02:12:34.770
<v Elisabetta Mori>network, a thing called Berknet,
um, and then repackage it and send

2629
02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:35.934
<v Elisabetta Mori>it out on the internet.

2630
02:12:36.482 --> 02:12:37.788
<v Elisabetta Mori>And when stuff comes in from the

2631
02:12:37.829 --> 02:12:41.792
<v Elisabetta Mori>internet, I will repackage it and
send it across Berknet.

2632
02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:46.343
<v Elisabetta Mori>Berknet, I might add was written
by Eric Schmidt, uh, a name you

2633
02:12:46.383 --> 02:12:50.896
<v Elisabetta Mori>might recognize from, uh, say a
little company called Google, um,

2634
02:12:51.082 --> 02:12:52.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>who was also one of our
classmates.

2635
02:12:53.368 --> 02:12:58.228
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, um, so by creating, Would you
creating, Would you like to, to,

2636
02:12:58.349 --> 02:12:59.471
<v Elisabetta Mori>to, to describe him?
Uh, him?

2637
02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:03.452
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, let, let me finish this story
and then we can go back to that.

2638
02:13:04.395 --> 02:13:07.090
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, well, actually I can describe
him fairly quickly, which is to

2639
02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:16.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>say he, uh, he, first of all, uh,
his father, I guess was, uh, an

2640
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:19.809
<v Elisabetta Mori>executive at American Motors,
which was the sort of number

2641
02:13:19.889 --> 02:13:24.151
<v Elisabetta Mori>three, uh, auto company after
General Motors and Ford.

2642
02:13:24.934 --> 02:13:28.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, you uh, you know,
essentially number three was not

2643
02:13:29.011 --> 02:13:29.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>big enough to make it.

2644
02:13:30.094 --> 02:13:31.807
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, you know, he saw that fade

2645
02:13:31.827 --> 02:13:32.068
<v Elisabetta Mori>away.

2646
02:13:32.128 --> 02:13:34.343
<v Elisabetta Mori>So he said, first of all, he knew

2647
02:13:34.363 --> 02:13:38.014
<v Elisabetta Mori>that his role was to be an
executive at a big company.

2648
02:13:38.882 --> 02:13:42.073
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, uh, that was his life
goal.

2649
02:13:42.334 --> 02:13:43.947
<v Elisabetta Mori>And he said, and And he said, and
it can't be the number three

2650
02:13:44.008 --> 02:13:45.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>company in the industry.

2651
02:13:45.293 --> 02:13:46.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>It It has to be one of the top

2652
02:13:46.608 --> 02:13:46.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>two.

2653
02:13:47.673 --> 02:13:50.108
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and he proved that make that

2654
02:13:50.148 --> 02:13:54.487
<v Elisabetta Mori>happen by ultimately getting to
Google and, uh, and, uh, having a

2655
02:13:54.547 --> 02:13:54.928
<v Elisabetta Mori>role there.

2656
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:59.246
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, so yeah, he, he, he had sort

2657
02:13:59.266 --> 02:14:02.054
<v Elisabetta Mori>of a dim view of some of the
professors at Berkeley.

2658
02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.534
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so we would be in class
together and he would just not cut

2659
02:14:05.554 --> 02:14:06.283
<v Elisabetta Mori>them any slack.

2660
02:14:06.323 --> 02:14:08.530
<v Elisabetta Mori>It was, uh, at the time it was a

2661
02:14:08.570 --> 02:14:12.650
<v Elisabetta Mori>little cringy, but, uh, you know,
it really sort of set his, uh,

2662
02:14:15.849 --> 02:14:19.327
<v Elisabetta Mori>biting any bullshit attitude,
which I think proved to be quite

2663
02:14:19.387 --> 02:14:21.254
<v Elisabetta Mori>successful in his later career.

2664
02:14:23.347 --> 02:14:24.210
<v Kirk McKusick>Okay.

2665
02:14:24.331 --> 02:14:25.595
<v Kirk McKusick>Let's go back to the story.

2666
02:14:26.182 --> 02:14:26.423
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

2667
02:14:26.664 --> 02:14:26.964
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

2668
02:14:26.984 --> 02:14:30.974
<v Elisabetta Mori>So to the story, um, so Eric wrote

2669
02:14:30.994 --> 02:14:32.628
<v Elisabetta Mori>this thing, it thing, it was
originally called deliver mail.

2670
02:14:32.989 --> 02:14:37.693
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and by being essentially able
to forward mail back and forth

2671
02:14:37.733 --> 02:14:40.630
<v Elisabetta Mori>between the internet and the local
Berkeley network, he no longer had

2672
02:14:41.112 --> 02:14:43.908
<v Elisabetta Mori>people, no longer needed to have
accounts on that machine.

2673
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:48.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so, um, that was, was
successful.

2674
02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:53.269
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, but then of course, the
problem was that in those days,

2675
02:14:53.289 --> 02:14:56.871
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, the internet wasn't the
be all end all that it is today.

2676
02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:01.954
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so there were tons of these
little networks all around.

2677
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.311
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there was Burke net and there
was the ARPA net and there was CS

2678
02:15:05.411 --> 02:15:11.240
<v Elisabetta Mori>net and UUCP net and, uh, all of
them had their own ways of, of

2679
02:15:11.381 --> 02:15:13.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>writing addresses and so on.

2680
02:15:13.751 --> 02:15:16.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so the, this deliver mail had

2681
02:15:16.267 --> 02:15:19.184
<v Elisabetta Mori>to deal with all of these
different, you know, forwarding

2682
02:15:19.224 --> 02:15:20.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>from one network to another.

2683
02:15:21.493 --> 02:15:25.230
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and the problem was that the

2684
02:15:26.072 --> 02:15:30.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>details on what you needed to do
in that was just coded into the

2685
02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:30.931
<v Elisabetta Mori>deliver mail.

2686
02:15:30.951 --> 02:15:32.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>So if you needed to make some

2687
02:15:32.174 --> 02:15:36.412
<v Elisabetta Mori>change, you had to write some new
code and then recompile deliver

2688
02:15:36.452 --> 02:15:38.165
<v Elisabetta Mori>mail and redeploy deliver mail.

2689
02:15:38.266 --> 02:15:40.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>And of course it had, you had to

2690
02:15:40.665 --> 02:15:43.354
<v Elisabetta Mori>get it on all the other machines
that you might be interacting

2691
02:15:43.421 --> 02:15:43.541
<v Elisabetta Mori>with.

2692
02:15:43.622 --> 02:15:46.371
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so this was just, uh, not a

2693
02:15:46.451 --> 02:15:47.374
<v Elisabetta Mori>workable strategy.

2694
02:15:47.662 --> 02:15:49.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so he then rewrote deliver

2695
02:15:49.909 --> 02:15:51.535
<v Elisabetta Mori>mail into something called send
mail.

2696
02:15:52.543 --> 02:15:56.233
<v Elisabetta Mori>And the difference between the two
was that send mail had a

2697
02:15:56.273 --> 02:15:58.284
<v Elisabetta Mori>configuration file that that you
would read in.

2698
02:15:59.307 --> 02:16:01.846
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so if you needed to change the
way something was done, the done,

2699
02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:06.573
<v Elisabetta Mori>all you had to do was make a few
fiddles in the configuration file

2700
02:16:06.713 --> 02:16:07.883
<v Elisabetta Mori>and then boom, it would work.

2701
02:16:07.923 --> 02:16:09.951
<v Elisabetta Mori>So there was no writing new code,

2702
02:16:10.341 --> 02:16:14.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>no needing to recompile, no need
to get binaries pushed to other

2703
02:16:14.053 --> 02:16:14.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>machines.

2704
02:16:14.454 --> 02:16:15.886
<v Elisabetta Mori>All All you had to do was send a

2705
02:16:16.207 --> 02:16:19.145
<v Elisabetta Mori>two line patch to the
configuration file and people

2706
02:16:19.165 --> 02:16:20.894
<v Elisabetta Mori>could drop it in at their leisure.

2707
02:16:22.726 --> 02:16:24.850
<v Elisabetta Mori>Now this configuration file was

2708
02:16:25.552 --> 02:16:29.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>massively complex because of
having to deal with all of these

2709
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>different networks.

2710
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:29.120
<v Elisabetta Mori>because of having to deal with all

2711
02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:29.160
<v Elisabetta Mori>of these different networks.

2712
02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:34.049
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, today, uh, when you look at

2713
02:16:34.432 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>mail systems, it it doesn't need
anywhere near that level of

2714
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:40.868
<v Elisabetta Mori>complexity because pretty much
we've all decided that TCP IP is,

2715
02:16:41.249 --> 02:16:42.332
<v Elisabetta Mori>is the way it's going to be.

2716
02:16:42.352 --> 02:16:45.187
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, and addresses are all

2717
02:16:45.246 --> 02:16:47.133
<v Elisabetta Mori>standardized throughout the entire
world.

2718
02:16:47.816 --> 02:16:51.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so it just becomes a whole lot
easier to do when you don't need

2719
02:16:51.273 --> 02:16:53.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>all the complexity of that
configuration file.

2720
02:16:54.002 --> 02:16:57.914
<v Elisabetta Mori>But for the first 10 or 20 years
of electronic mail, it was

2721
02:16:58.074 --> 02:16:58.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>indispensable.

2722
02:16:58.776 --> 02:17:03.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, Uh, and so, uh, one of the

2723
02:17:03.513 --> 02:17:05.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>little side comments, well, send
comments, well, send mail became

2724
02:17:06.107 --> 02:17:06.968
<v Elisabetta Mori>prolific throughout.

2725
02:17:07.170 --> 02:17:08.494
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, it's just what everybody

2726
02:17:08.615 --> 02:17:08.795
<v Elisabetta Mori>used.

2727
02:17:09.684 --> 02:17:11.431
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in fact, Eric eventually

2728
02:17:11.471 --> 02:17:16.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>started a company, SendMailInc to
provide commercialized support for

2729
02:17:16.272 --> 02:17:16.733
<v Elisabetta Mori>SendMail.

2730
02:17:17.736 --> 02:17:19.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and that, that company, um,

2731
02:17:21.746 --> 02:17:26.308
<v Elisabetta Mori>ran for about 10 years and
finally, uh, was sold out to a, to

2732
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:30.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>another company, uh, because the
need for the complexity of

2733
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:32.563
<v Elisabetta Mori>SendMail had pretty much gone away
at that point.

2734
02:17:32.724 --> 02:17:37.272
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, uh, it still delivers
about 10 or 20% of the mail on the

2735
02:17:37.312 --> 02:17:39.787
<v Elisabetta Mori>internet today, but at, you know,
but at, you know, it's down from

2736
02:17:39.807 --> 02:17:42.544
<v Elisabetta Mori>the a hundred percent that it had
for at least a decade.

2737
02:17:43.727 --> 02:17:47.346
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, and one of the, uh, the
comments that, uh, I, I I, I most

2738
02:17:47.447 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>like is that, uh, you know, all
those people sending gay hate mail

2739
02:17:53.132 --> 02:17:55.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>have to send it through a program
written by a gay person.

2740
02:17:55.812 --> 02:17:55.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

2741
02:17:55.842 --> 02:17:55.871
<v Elisabetta Mori>a gay person.

2742
02:17:55.871 --> 02:17:55.882
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

2743
02:18:01.355 --> 02:18:02.939
<v Elisabetta Mori>Let's go back to, to you.

2744
02:18:02.959 --> 02:18:03.040
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, a few last questions.

2745
02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:03.106
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, Let's go back to, to you.

2746
02:18:03.106 --> 02:18:03.156
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, a few last questions.

2747
02:18:03.156 --> 02:18:09.288
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, answers that they don't have

2748
02:18:09.308 --> 02:18:13.202
<v Kirk McKusick>to be long, but like first general
first general public license

2749
02:18:13.323 --> 02:18:14.125
<v Kirk McKusick>versus BSD license.

2750
02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.008
<v Kirk McKusick>What are your thoughts about that?

2751
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.226
<v Kirk McKusick>Well, you're of course, asking
somebody who might be just a

2752
02:18:25.286 --> 02:18:26.911
<v Kirk McKusick>little bit biased.

2753
02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:28.219
<v Kirk McKusick>Um, but, uh, the, the, the

2754
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:35.249
<v Elisabetta Mori>difference really is, um, with,
with GPL, especially with GPL

2755
02:18:35.308 --> 02:18:40.790
<v Elisabetta Mori>three, um, you are required to
give your changes back that you

2756
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:43.236
<v Elisabetta Mori>make to any GPL software.

2757
02:18:43.236 --> 02:18:43.316
<v Elisabetta Mori>Even if you have, if, if you have,

2758
02:18:43.316 --> 02:18:43.337
<v Elisabetta Mori>GPL software.

2759
02:18:43.337 --> 02:18:43.416
<v Elisabetta Mori>Even if you have, if, if you have,

2760
02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.188
<v Elisabetta Mori>so the way people would get around
this, companies would get around

2761
02:18:51.208 --> 02:18:52.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>it is they would patent it.

2762
02:18:52.253 --> 02:18:52.724
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so sure, you could get the it.

2763
02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:53.986
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so sure, you could get the
code, but then you had the license

2764
02:18:54.008 --> 02:18:54.468
<v Elisabetta Mori>to patent.

2765
02:18:55.219 --> 02:18:56.124
<v Elisabetta Mori>So between GPL two and three, GPL

2766
02:18:56.144 --> 02:19:00.793
<v Elisabetta Mori>three says, not only do you have
to give the code away, but you

2767
02:19:00.793 --> 02:19:00.972
<v Elisabetta Mori>also have to have give the code
away, but you also have to have a

2768
02:19:00.972 --> 02:19:04.903
<v Elisabetta Mori>royalty free patent license for
any patents that you have on that

2769
02:19:04.923 --> 02:19:05.083
<v Elisabetta Mori>software.

2770
02:19:05.102 --> 02:19:10.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, uh, I will note that the,

2771
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:13.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>the the Linux kernel itself is
still GPL three.

2772
02:19:14.361 --> 02:19:20.629
<v Elisabetta Mori>The Linux kernel itself is still
GPL two, but most of the rest of

2773
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:25.147
<v Elisabetta Mori>the stuff that goes around it, uh,
it, uh, is GPL three at this

2774
02:19:25.208 --> 02:19:27.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>point, like GCC, the compiler, so
on.

2775
02:19:28.476 --> 02:19:31.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, by contrast the Berkeley
license.

2776
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:36.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, so we have copyright, which is
sort of the traditional, uh,

2777
02:19:38.605 --> 02:19:39.727
<v Elisabetta Mori>protecting your assets.

2778
02:19:40.148 --> 02:19:42.614
<v Elisabetta Mori>We have a copy left, which is the

2779
02:19:42.654 --> 02:19:45.188
<v Elisabetta Mori>GPL, which is you absolutely have
to give it all away.

2780
02:19:45.208 --> 02:19:50.445
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and so we think of the BSD
license as copy center, take it

2781
02:19:50.485 --> 02:19:52.963
<v Elisabetta Mori>down to the copy center, make as
many copies as you like, have a

2782
02:19:53.004 --> 02:19:54.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>good life, give it back if you
want them, if you don't.

2783
02:19:55.955 --> 02:20:00.590
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and Um, and so the, the GPL
people will argue that this just

2784
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:03.842
<v Elisabetta Mori>forces allows companies to, you
know, companies you know, take all

2785
02:20:03.882 --> 02:20:08.295
<v Elisabetta Mori>this public source or open source
stuff and then just lock it back

2786
02:20:08.361 --> 02:20:08.822
<v Elisabetta Mori>down again.

2787
02:20:09.284 --> 02:20:10.107
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's true.

2788
02:20:10.147 --> 02:20:11.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>It does allow that to happen.

2789
02:20:12.153 --> 02:20:14.747
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, but the reality of the

2790
02:20:14.767 --> 02:20:19.088
<v Elisabetta Mori>situation is that, you know,
companies grab it, they run off,

2791
02:20:19.128 --> 02:20:20.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>they do their proprietary stuff.

2792
02:20:20.946 --> 02:20:23.366
<v Elisabetta Mori>And now, you know, time passes and

2793
02:20:23.386 --> 02:20:26.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>a new version of FreeBSD or
whatever comes out.

2794
02:20:26.776 --> 02:20:31.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, And, uh, it has a bunch
of new features and a whole bunch

2795
02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:33.014
<v Elisabetta Mori>of bug fixes that they need.

2796
02:20:33.561 --> 02:20:35.628
<v Elisabetta Mori>And now they have to, you know,

2797
02:20:35.889 --> 02:20:37.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>get, figure out what those are.

2798
02:20:37.515 --> 02:20:37.552
<v Elisabetta Mori>And are.

2799
02:20:37.552 --> 02:20:40.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they can't just look at the
differences between what they have

2800
02:20:40.393 --> 02:20:43.955
<v Elisabetta Mori>and, and, you know, what FreeBSD
has released because it, you know,

2801
02:20:43.955 --> 02:20:46.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>it's it, you know, it's got their
stuff in it and other things that

2802
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>they've changed.

2803
02:20:47.033 --> 02:20:48.465
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, so they have to

2804
02:20:48.485 --> 02:20:49.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort of pick and choose.

2805
02:20:49.409 --> 02:20:50.644
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it turns out that it's, you

2806
02:20:50.644 --> 02:20:54.151
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, out that it's, you know,
many man hours of work to, you

2807
02:20:55.014 --> 02:20:57.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, incorporate those changes.

2808
02:20:57.730 --> 02:20:59.684
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, a lot of them are

2809
02:20:59.744 --> 02:21:03.194
<v Elisabetta Mori>things where, you know, they've
done something to fix a bug.

2810
02:21:03.194 --> 02:21:07.153
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, Uh, but then it ended up that
bug got fixed, but in a different

2811
02:21:07.214 --> 02:21:07.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>way.

2812
02:21:07.515 --> 02:21:08.306
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And so then they have to

2813
02:21:08.346 --> 02:21:11.008
<v Elisabetta Mori>figure out, you know, which is the
right way to do this and on and on

2814
02:21:11.028 --> 02:21:11.208
<v Elisabetta Mori>and on.

2815
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:12.785
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they realized, you know, if we

2816
02:21:12.825 --> 02:21:15.329
<v Elisabetta Mori>had just, you know, that you know,
that bug fix is nothing to do with

2817
02:21:15.369 --> 02:21:16.433
<v Elisabetta Mori>our proprietary code.

2818
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:18.068
<v Elisabetta Mori>And if we'd simply pass that over

2819
02:21:18.148 --> 02:21:22.551
<v Elisabetta Mori>to FreeBSD, then it would just be
there and we wouldn't have to deal

2820
02:21:22.591 --> 02:21:22.812
<v Elisabetta Mori>with it.

2821
02:21:23.402 --> 02:21:24.809
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so what ends up happening is,

2822
02:21:25.391 --> 02:21:28.467
<v Elisabetta Mori>uh, after they've revised for the
first time, you start getting some

2823
02:21:28.487 --> 02:21:30.827
<v Elisabetta Mori>bug fixes back, not a lot, but you
not a lot, but you get some bug

2824
02:21:30.867 --> 02:21:31.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>fixes back.

2825
02:21:31.751 --> 02:21:33.625
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then they, the next time they

2826
02:21:33.645 --> 02:21:36.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>have to do another upgrade every
two years or so.

2827
02:21:36.053 --> 02:21:39.132
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and the next time it comes
around, they're like, Oh, look,

2828
02:21:39.313 --> 02:21:41.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, it's much easier this
time because there was all this

2829
02:21:41.871 --> 02:21:42.962
<v Elisabetta Mori>stuff that was just there.

2830
02:21:42.962 --> 02:21:42.962
<v Elisabetta Mori>there.

2831
02:21:42.982 --> 02:21:48.077
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and so then they, they give
you a lot of stuff back, you know,

2832
02:21:48.077 --> 02:21:48.688
<v Elisabetta Mori>they say, well, back, you know,
they say, well, what's the stuff

2833
02:21:48.708 --> 02:21:49.432
<v Elisabetta Mori>we really care about?
And about?

2834
02:21:49.432 --> 02:21:51.291
<v Elisabetta Mori>And they just got to narrow it
down to this little bit.

2835
02:21:51.291 --> 02:21:51.512
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then bit.

2836
02:21:51.512 --> 02:21:52.485
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then they pretty much the rest

2837
02:21:52.526 --> 02:21:53.329
<v Elisabetta Mori>of it comes back.

2838
02:21:53.911 --> 02:21:54.833
<v Elisabetta Mori>And sure enough, the next sure

2839
02:21:54.833 --> 02:21:57.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>enough, the next third upgrade
they do, it's even easier yet.

2840
02:21:57.561 --> 02:21:59.528
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so pretty soon they're trying
to give you stuff.

2841
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:03.349
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, it's like, you know, it's
specific to their product.

2842
02:22:03.409 --> 02:22:05.949
<v Elisabetta Mori>And if you put it in FreeBSD, then
you're going to have to maintain

2843
02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:06.251
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

2844
02:22:06.291 --> 02:22:07.024
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, you don't you know,

2845
02:22:07.024 --> 02:22:07.445
<v Elisabetta Mori>you don't want to do that.

2846
02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:08.931
<v Elisabetta Mori>So thank you very much for

2847
02:22:09.072 --> 02:22:09.835
<v Elisabetta Mori>offering that code.

2848
02:22:09.835 --> 02:22:10.504
<v Elisabetta Mori>We really that code.

2849
02:22:10.504 --> 02:22:13.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>We really appreciate that, but no,
uh, no, we don't need that.

2850
02:22:14.255 --> 02:22:19.157
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and so, uh, if you sort of
look over time, you know, uh,

2851
02:22:19.224 --> 02:22:25.846
<v Elisabetta Mori>you'll see that the, the GPL folks
and the, the the, the BSD licensed

2852
02:22:25.886 --> 02:22:28.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>folks end up getting more or less
the same amount back.

2853
02:22:28.515 --> 02:22:28.555
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, in fact, back.

2854
02:22:28.555 --> 02:22:31.684
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, in fact, a lot of the

2855
02:22:32.226 --> 02:22:35.482
<v Elisabetta Mori>companies with GPL are going out
of their way to try and figure out

2856
02:22:35.482 --> 02:22:38.484
<v Elisabetta Mori>out how to get around it by, you
know, doing binary things and

2857
02:22:38.545 --> 02:22:39.347
<v Elisabetta Mori>other stuff like this.

2858
02:22:39.367 --> 02:22:41.923
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and then the GPL people, they,

2859
02:22:41.983 --> 02:22:44.112
<v Elisabetta Mori>they design new interfaces that
are GPL.

2860
02:22:44.402 --> 02:22:46.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>If you use this interface, then
then you have to give any code

2861
02:22:46.606 --> 02:22:48.534
<v Elisabetta Mori>away that you use the interface,
right?

2862
02:22:48.534 --> 02:22:50.507
<v Elisabetta Mori>And interface, right?
And it's just this battle going on

2863
02:22:50.527 --> 02:22:56.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>between them, uh, versus in the,
in the, the BSD one, you know, we

2864
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:57.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>just don't have those battles.

2865
02:22:59.666 --> 02:23:00.931
<v Elisabetta Mori>The companies that want to run off

2866
02:23:00.971 --> 02:23:01.694
<v Elisabetta Mori>and do their own thing.

2867
02:23:01.734 --> 02:23:02.005
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, and there do their own

2868
02:23:02.005 --> 02:23:02.015
<v Elisabetta Mori>thing.

2869
02:23:02.015 --> 02:23:02.806
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, and there are some that do

2870
02:23:02.846 --> 02:23:03.086
<v Elisabetta Mori>that.

2871
02:23:03.789 --> 02:23:05.494
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and for the most part, they,

2872
02:23:05.494 --> 02:23:08.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>they part, they, they just at some
point give up on trying to do

2873
02:23:08.130 --> 02:23:11.929
<v Elisabetta Mori>upgrades and, you know, then, then
they get a huge amount of

2874
02:23:11.969 --> 02:23:15.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>technical debt and, you know,
eventually, you know, they have to

2875
02:23:15.929 --> 02:23:16.531
<v Elisabetta Mori>do something else.

2876
02:23:16.612 --> 02:23:19.329
<v Elisabetta Mori>But, uh, the other thing though,

2877
02:23:19.690 --> 02:23:24.593
<v Elisabetta Mori>is that, um, at the end of the
day, it's the open source that's

2878
02:23:24.653 --> 02:23:26.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>most important, you know, and you
know, and so I can sit here and

2879
02:23:26.986 --> 02:23:30.745
<v Elisabetta Mori>niggle about what's the better
license to have, but the high

2880
02:23:30.806 --> 02:23:35.387
<v Elisabetta Mori>order bit to me is open source
software, you know, and that's the

2881
02:23:35.428 --> 02:23:36.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>thing that's important.

2882
02:23:36.431 --> 02:23:38.103
<v Elisabetta Mori>And as you know, that is the thing

2883
02:23:38.143 --> 02:23:43.613
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I've, you know, if what's the
thing I want to see going forward,

2884
02:23:43.642 --> 02:23:45.228
<v Elisabetta Mori>that's what I want to see going
forward.

2885
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:48.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, it's been wildly
successful in the days of Sunmail

2886
02:23:48.831 --> 02:23:51.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>when they were trying to get
funding, uh, you know, people

2887
02:23:51.751 --> 02:23:53.876
<v Elisabetta Mori>like, how can you, you know, have
how can you, you know, have a

2888
02:23:53.926 --> 02:23:55.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>company based around open source
software?

2889
02:23:55.973 --> 02:23:58.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, any of your competitors
can just get it.

2890
02:23:58.469 --> 02:24:02.411
<v Elisabetta Mori>And it's like, they just didn't
understand the framework of open

2891
02:24:02.431 --> 02:24:03.113
<v Elisabetta Mori>source software.

2892
02:24:03.113 --> 02:24:04.284
<v Elisabetta Mori>And And the thing about open

2893
02:24:04.304 --> 02:24:06.451
<v Elisabetta Mori>source software is it's not good
for everything.

2894
02:24:07.214 --> 02:24:10.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, it's good for sort of what
I'll call infrastructure, all the

2895
02:24:10.351 --> 02:24:11.314
<v Elisabetta Mori>low level stuff.

2896
02:24:12.063 --> 02:24:13.307
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, things like, let's say

2897
02:24:13.387 --> 02:24:15.836
<v Elisabetta Mori>TurboTax, which fills out your
taxes for you.

2898
02:24:16.305 --> 02:24:17.971
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't want that to be open
source.

2899
02:24:18.293 --> 02:24:21.353
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, I want a company that I
can go to and say, by God, I got

2900
02:24:21.353 --> 02:24:25.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>God, I got audited this and it
because your program is wrong and,

2901
02:24:25.133 --> 02:24:27.207
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, and you know, and you
have to pay for my penalty.

2902
02:24:27.909 --> 02:24:31.726
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and so, you know, there are
certainly bits and pieces of

2903
02:24:31.827 --> 02:24:35.962
<v Elisabetta Mori>software that don't fit that open
source model.

2904
02:24:36.404 --> 02:24:39.994
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and you know, companies now
understand that.

2905
02:24:40.034 --> 02:24:42.503
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, companies have really
learned that, you know, by putting

2906
02:24:42.523 --> 02:24:44.807
<v Elisabetta Mori>stuff out in open source, you're
going to get a lot of free

2907
02:24:44.967 --> 02:24:47.567
<v Elisabetta Mori>development help and debugging
help and other things of that

2908
02:24:47.628 --> 02:24:47.869
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort.

2909
02:24:47.889 --> 02:24:49.946
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and it certainly helps

2910
02:24:49.986 --> 02:24:53.123
<v Elisabetta Mori>security massively because when a
lot of eyes are looking at things,

2911
02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:58.686
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, stuff gets discovered
and fixed, which is why I wish

2912
02:24:58.706 --> 02:25:02.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>that we, the, you know, there's an
open source voting machine

2913
02:25:02.489 --> 02:25:06.750
<v Elisabetta Mori>software, but so far it has not
been adopted in any of the U S

2914
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:07.171
<v Elisabetta Mori>States.

2915
02:25:08.034 --> 02:25:10.163
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you you know, the, the

2916
02:25:10.204 --> 02:25:13.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>analysis has been done of the
closed source voting software is

2917
02:25:13.575 --> 02:25:13.785
<v Elisabetta Mori>pretty dire.

2918
02:25:13.785 --> 02:25:13.855
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, you know, is pretty dire.

2919
02:25:13.855 --> 02:25:18.210
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, you know, I think that
would be a case where having it

2920
02:25:18.270 --> 02:25:21.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>open source would be a huge
benefit, but, uh, so far that

2921
02:25:21.690 --> 02:25:22.273
<v Elisabetta Mori>hasn't happened.

2922
02:25:25.685 --> 02:25:27.870
<v Kirk McKusick>Uh, what advice would you give to

2923
02:25:27.951 --> 02:25:30.516
<v Kirk McKusick>someone willing to pursue your
career today?

2924
02:25:34.709 --> 02:25:36.454
<v Elisabetta Mori>Sorry, I've missed the last half
of that question.

2925
02:25:36.454 --> 02:25:41.413
<v Elisabetta Mori>So So what advice would you give
to someone willing to pursue your

2926
02:25:41.573 --> 02:25:44.670
<v Elisabetta Mori>career today?
Ah, Ah, yeah.

2927
02:25:44.831 --> 02:25:45.654
<v Kirk McKusick>Pursue the career.

2928
02:25:51.246 --> 02:25:52.289
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, there's all kinds of

2929
02:25:52.369 --> 02:25:54.822
<v Elisabetta Mori>advice that I would give, you
know, which which would have

2930
02:25:54.862 --> 02:25:59.244
<v Elisabetta Mori>depend on, uh, what it was that
they were, were trying to do or,

2931
02:25:59.265 --> 02:26:00.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, where they want it to
go.

2932
02:26:00.831 --> 02:26:08.742
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, if, if somebody that's, you
know, interested in, um, um,

2933
02:26:11.451 --> 02:26:13.157
<v Elisabetta Mori>operating systems or something
like that, you know, I can sort of

2934
02:26:13.157 --> 02:26:13.287
<v Elisabetta Mori>lay out to them, you know, or
something like that, you know, I

2935
02:26:13.287 --> 02:26:16.244
<v Elisabetta Mori>can sort of lay out to them, you
know, well, you know, here's sort

2936
02:26:16.265 --> 02:26:18.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>of what I see as the interesting
problems.

2937
02:26:18.875 --> 02:26:22.093
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, there's other things like, you
know, all this stuff that's going

2938
02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:26.611
<v Elisabetta Mori>on with AI, which I am both
fascinated and terrified of.

2939
02:26:27.493 --> 02:26:30.851
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, you know, so if, if someone
has been working on AI, I'd say,

2940
02:26:30.891 --> 02:26:35.312
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, I think we need to sort
of sit down and figure out how we

2941
02:26:35.352 --> 02:26:39.891
<v Elisabetta Mori>can do this in a way that isn't
going to cause a catastrophe down

2942
02:26:39.931 --> 02:26:40.252
<v Elisabetta Mori>the road.

2943
02:26:40.272 --> 02:26:44.190
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and, uh, I, I certainly hope

2944
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:47.408
<v Elisabetta Mori>that we're, you know, we're we're
going to come to that before

2945
02:26:48.311 --> 02:26:49.996
<v Elisabetta Mori>something bad starts to happen.

2946
02:26:49.996 --> 02:26:50.062
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, but, you know, starts to

2947
02:26:50.062 --> 02:26:50.072
<v Elisabetta Mori>happen.

2948
02:26:50.072 --> 02:26:52.989
<v Elisabetta Mori>Uh, and, but, you know, you know,

2949
02:26:56.084 --> 02:26:58.815
<v Elisabetta Mori>then there's just sort of the life
philosophy and that's, you know,

2950
02:26:58.815 --> 02:27:02.254
<v Elisabetta Mori>sort you know, sort of, you know,
be true to yourself, figure out,

2951
02:27:02.394 --> 02:27:02.762
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, figure out, you know,
out, you know, figure out, you

2952
02:27:02.762 --> 02:27:05.232
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, who you are and what you
want to try and get done.

2953
02:27:05.232 --> 02:27:10.449
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, And, and, you know, sometimes
you have to just sort of step back

2954
02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:15.250
<v Elisabetta Mori>and look at your life and say, all
right, you know, let's do an

2955
02:27:15.270 --> 02:27:15.973
<v Elisabetta Mori>evaluation here.

2956
02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:16.903
<v Elisabetta Mori>You know, what's working well,

2957
02:27:16.943 --> 02:27:18.369
<v Elisabetta Mori>what's not working well, et
cetera.

2958
02:27:19.132 --> 02:27:23.893
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, so, I mean, I don't have, you
know, the little elevator pitch

2959
02:27:23.994 --> 02:27:26.130
<v Elisabetta Mori>on, you know, these these are the
things that you need to do.

2960
02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:33.057
<v Kirk McKusick>Is there anything you would do
differently if you had your time

2961
02:27:33.157 --> 02:27:43.256
<v Kirk McKusick>again?
I have been remarkably lucky in

2962
02:27:43.316 --> 02:27:49.389
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I have spent rather little of
my time doing things that I feel

2963
02:27:49.409 --> 02:27:53.117
<v Elisabetta Mori>like I could have, uh, done some,
you know, used some, you know,

2964
02:27:53.117 --> 02:27:55.331
<v Elisabetta Mori>used that time more effectively
doing something else.

2965
02:27:55.973 --> 02:28:00.234
<v Elisabetta Mori>I mean, the travel is one of the
things, you know, I, a lot of

2966
02:28:00.274 --> 02:28:02.730
<v Elisabetta Mori>people say, well, I'm going to
wait until I retire and then I'm

2967
02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:05.828
<v Elisabetta Mori>going to finally, you know, start
traveling and like traveling is

2968
02:28:06.128 --> 02:28:06.489
<v Elisabetta Mori>hard.

2969
02:28:07.653 --> 02:28:10.026
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, you know, that's not

2970
02:28:10.107 --> 02:28:13.197
<v Elisabetta Mori>something that you're going to be
very successful if you wait until

2971
02:28:13.197 --> 02:28:15.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>you're, you wait until you're, you
know, 65 before you start trying

2972
02:28:15.792 --> 02:28:16.193
<v Elisabetta Mori>to do it.

2973
02:28:17.137 --> 02:28:21.114
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and so I'm very, very happy

2974
02:28:21.154 --> 02:28:25.392
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I, for example, took time
away from my job to do things like

2975
02:28:26.555 --> 02:28:28.215
<v Elisabetta Mori>traveling for three months in
Australia or New Zealand traveling

2976
02:28:28.215 --> 02:28:28.766
<v Elisabetta Mori>for three months in Australia or
New Zealand or wherever.

2977
02:28:28.786 --> 02:28:34.303
<v Elisabetta Mori>Um, and this is, you know,
particularly come, come come, come

2978
02:28:35.246 --> 02:28:39.899
<v Elisabetta Mori>back to become even more clear to
me because I've been diagnosed

2979
02:28:39.919 --> 02:28:40.070
<v Elisabetta Mori>with primary lateral sclerosis,
because I've been diagnosed

2980
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:43.610
<v Elisabetta Mori>primary lateral sclerosis, which
means at this point I'm losing the

2981
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:44.473
<v Elisabetta Mori>ability to walk.

2982
02:28:44.473 --> 02:28:44.572
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, walk.

2983
02:28:44.572 --> 02:28:49.169
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, you know, I just couldn't do
some of the hiking and skiing and

2984
02:28:49.189 --> 02:28:56.794
<v Elisabetta Mori>you know, other things that I was
able to do, um, in my forties and

2985
02:28:56.814 --> 02:28:57.195
<v Elisabetta Mori>fifties.

2986
02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:58.645
<v Elisabetta Mori>And if I hadn't done that, I, you

2987
02:28:58.846 --> 02:29:02.004
<v Elisabetta Mori>know, today, yeah, I've got the
time, but I couldn't do those

2988
02:29:02.084 --> 02:29:02.847
<v Elisabetta Mori>things anymore.

2989
02:29:02.987 --> 02:29:08.653
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, uh, I'm very happy that I made

2990
02:29:08.753 --> 02:29:11.030
<v Elisabetta Mori>time to do those things when it
would have been very easy to just

2991
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.160
<v Elisabetta Mori>be totally sucked into my to do
those things when it would have

2992
02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:11.270
<v Elisabetta Mori>been very easy to just be totally
sucked into my career.

2993
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:22.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>And, uh, so I think, you know, I
think it's important that, uh, you

2994
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.140
<v Elisabetta Mori>sit back and, and, it's important
that, uh, you sit back and, and,

2995
02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:28.337
<v Elisabetta Mori>and, you know, don't just let the
everything of the moment totally

2996
02:29:28.377 --> 02:29:29.000
<v Elisabetta Mori>drive your life.

2997
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:29.060
<v Elisabetta Mori>Some sort of periodically sort of

2998
02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:29.160
<v Elisabetta Mori>step back everything of the moment
totally drive your life.

2999
02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:30.240
<v Elisabetta Mori>Some sort of periodically sort of
step back and say, you know, what

3000
02:29:30.381 --> 02:29:32.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>are some of the things I want to
accomplish in my lifetime?

3001
02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:35.128
<v Elisabetta Mori>And let's get started on some of
those projects a little earlier,

3002
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.048
<v Elisabetta Mori>not just, you know, put them off
to some amorphous time in the

3003
02:29:38.068 --> 02:29:38.269
<v Elisabetta Mori>future.

3004
02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.443
<v Elisabetta Mori>Is there anything you would like

3005
02:29:41.463 --> 02:29:42.526
<v Elisabetta Mori>to add that we haven't covered
today?

3006
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.325
<v Kirk McKusick>I would say you have done a very
good job of sort of covering all

3007
02:29:48.365 --> 02:29:53.702
<v Kirk McKusick>the big pieces of my life.

3008
02:29:53.722 --> 02:29:56.351
<v Elisabetta Mori>So I, I don't really have anything

3009
02:29:56.531 --> 02:29:56.933
<v Elisabetta Mori>else to add.

3010
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:57.342
<v Elisabetta Mori>I don't think.

3011
02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:58.581
<v Elisabetta Mori>Thank you very much, Dan.

3012
02:29:58.602 --> 02:30:02.742
<v Elisabetta Mori>And really, thank you.

3013
02:30:02.762 --> 02:30:06.071
<v Kirk McKusick>It's been a real pleasure talking
to you today.

3014
02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:07.762
<v Kirk McKusick>Well, thank you.

3015
02:30:07.782 --> 02:30:13.851
<v Kirk McKusick>Um, I, you can probably imagine

3016
02:30:14.032 --> 02:30:16.020
<v Elisabetta Mori>that I've been interviewed by a
number of people in my career and,

3017
02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:16.090
<v Elisabetta Mori>uh, you did a particularly good
job.

3018
02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:16.120
<v Elisabetta Mori>So thank you.

3019
02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:16.180
<v Elisabetta Mori>I've been interviewed by a number

3020
02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:16.290
<v Elisabetta Mori>of people career and, uh, you did
a particularly good job.

3021
02:30:16.290 --> 02:30:16.320
<v Elisabetta Mori>So thank you.

3022
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:17.683
