00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:07.052
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Welcome to FOSSDA, the Free and Open

2
00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:08.876
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Source Stories Digital Archive.

3
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.467
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I am Elisabetta Mori, an interviewer with

4
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:13.971
<v Elisabetta Mori:>FOSSDA, and today I'll be talking to

5
00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:15.754
<v Elisabetta Mori:>John Maddog Hall.

6
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:19.926
<v Elisabetta Mori:>We are recording on TheirStory.io, and I

7
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.772
<v Elisabetta Mori:>am in Livorno, Italy, and Maddog is

8
00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:25.936
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in Amherst, New Hampshire in the US.

9
00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:30.026
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Maddog is currently the board chair of

10
00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.433
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the Linux Professional Institute, the co-founder and

11
00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:36.664
<v Elisabetta Mori:>senior advisor to Kaninos Lukos, the president

12
00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.992
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of Project Kawan, and the executive director

13
00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:41.155
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of Linux International.

14
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:44.885
<v Elisabetta Mori:>He has been a programmer, system designer,

15
00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:50.672
<v Elisabetta Mori:>synthesis administrator, product manager, technical marketing manager,

16
00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:54.236
<v Elisabetta Mori:>educator, author, CEO, and consultant.

17
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.805
<v Elisabetta Mori:>He has worked on many systems, both

18
00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:04.611
<v Elisabetta Mori:>proprietary and open, having concentrated on Unix

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.349
<v Elisabetta Mori:>systems since 1980 and Linux systems since

20
00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.703
<v Elisabetta Mori:>1994.

21
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:13.125
<v Elisabetta Mori:>When he first met Linus Torvalds, he

22
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.472
<v Elisabetta Mori:>currently recognized the commercial importance of Linux

23
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.316
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and free and open source software.

24
00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:21.064
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Welcome, Maddog.

25
00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:23.828
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you for being here today.

26
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.995
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Let's start with where and when you

27
00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:29.476
<v Elisabetta Mori:>were born.

28
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:33.126
<v Maddog:>Well, thank you very much for inviting

29
00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:33.868
<v Maddog:>me to do this.

30
00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:36.613
<v Maddog:>I'm very honored to give this talk.

31
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.854
<v Maddog:>I was born in Baltimore, Maryland in

32
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Maddog:>1950, and that was a time where

33
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:47.994
<v Maddog:>we saw the white person's water fountain

34
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.017
<v Maddog:>and the black person's water fountain.

35
00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:52.968
<v Maddog:>We saw the white person's lunch counter

36
00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.974
<v Maddog:>and the black person's lunch counter.

37
00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Maddog:>We celebrated the Civil War because it

38
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.175
<v Maddog:>was a hundred years since that had

39
00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:01.576
<v Maddog:>happened.

40
00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Maddog:>And of course, it was also five

41
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.035
<v Maddog:>years after the end of World War

42
00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:07.135
<v Maddog:>II.

43
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:09.763
<v Maddog:>So we saw a lot of the

44
00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.947
<v Maddog:>people who had been fighting during that

45
00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:15.271
<v Maddog:>war that had come home and were

46
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:16.193
<v Maddog:>now living among us.

47
00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.268
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you describe your parents?

48
00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:26.469
<v Maddog:>My parents were the mom and pop.

49
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.175
<v Maddog:>My father was an airplane mechanic.

50
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:32.409
<v Maddog:>My mother was basically a homemaker, but

51
00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.034
<v Maddog:>she had also studied accounting.

52
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.624
<v Maddog:>And she would work from time to

53
00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:41.971
<v Maddog:>time in jewelry stores or bakery shops

54
00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:43.915
<v Maddog:>or things like that as a manager

55
00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:44.555
<v Maddog:>of the store.

56
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.982
<v Maddog:>But most of the time she stayed

57
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.105
<v Maddog:>at home taking care of my brother,

58
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.948
<v Maddog:>who was seven years older than I

59
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.653
<v Maddog:>was, and myself and my father, of

60
00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:54.994
<v Maddog:>course.

61
00:02:58.566 --> 00:02:59.549
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Do you have any siblings?

62
00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:02.784
<v Maddog:>I have one brother who is seven

63
00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:05.248
<v Maddog:>years older than I am, but that's

64
00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Maddog:>the only person who is a sibling.

65
00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.053
<v Maddog:>He is still alive.

66
00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.929
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What was your family life like?

67
00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Maddog:>It was good.

68
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:19.666
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Did you have any important influence on

69
00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you in your early life?

70
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.907
<v Maddog:>My father was a good influence on

71
00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:29.291
<v Maddog:>me because he was very interested in

72
00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:31.795
<v Maddog:>mechanical things and machinery.

73
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.287
<v Maddog:>He would subscribe to these magazines called

74
00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.653
<v Maddog:>Popular Mechanics and Popular Science and Popular

75
00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:40.415
<v Maddog:>Electronics.

76
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.345
<v Maddog:>And every month when they came, he

77
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:44.889
<v Maddog:>would read through them and I would

78
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:45.631
<v Maddog:>read through them.

79
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.391
<v Maddog:>I particularly like the Popular Electronics magazines.

80
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.883
<v Maddog:>And as I got older, I attended

81
00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:56.430
<v Maddog:>a electronics shop in high school where

82
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.515
<v Maddog:>we built radios and TVs.

83
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.444
<v Maddog:>We would first have to take apart

84
00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:05.331
<v Maddog:>old broken radios and TVs, the parts,

85
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:07.114
<v Maddog:>because they were very expensive.

86
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.708
<v Maddog:>And then we would design new radios

87
00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.432
<v Maddog:>out of the parts that we had

88
00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:14.113
<v Maddog:>scavenged.

89
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.269
<v Maddog:>So I learned a lot about electronics

90
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:17.851
<v Maddog:>from that.

91
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.481
<v Maddog:>And that was one of the reasons

92
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.647
<v Maddog:>why I wanted to become an electrician

93
00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.434
<v Maddog:>when I went to university.

94
00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.409
<v Maddog:>My father also worked in a toy

95
00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:28.771
<v Maddog:>store.

96
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.705
<v Maddog:>And I was assigned the assembling of

97
00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:36.232
<v Maddog:>parts, bicycles and things, particularly the things

98
00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:37.954
<v Maddog:>that required instructions.

99
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.228
<v Maddog:>My reading instructions.

100
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.683
<v Maddog:>And he would typically give this to

101
00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.167
<v Maddog:>me and I would read the instructions

102
00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.671
<v Maddog:>and then assemble the components for him.

103
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So you went to high school in

104
00:04:58.851 --> 00:04:59.192
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the mid-1960s.

105
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:02.824
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And then what happened?

106
00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:05.731
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What did you, what's your choice after

107
00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:06.333
<v Elisabetta Mori:>high school?

108
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:09.968
<v Maddog:>Well, I applied and was accepted to

109
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:11.212
<v Maddog:>Drexel University.

110
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.068
<v Maddog:>It was a very good engineering school,

111
00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.292
<v Maddog:>very well known.

112
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.684
<v Maddog:>And it was a private university, not

113
00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:22.429
<v Maddog:>a public one, but its tuition rate

114
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.814
<v Maddog:>was relatively low for those days.

115
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.308
<v Maddog:>And I started studying to be an

116
00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:30.411
<v Maddog:>electrical engineer.

117
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.483
<v Maddog:>The other thing about Drexel was that

118
00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:37.887
<v Maddog:>it was a cooperative education school, which

119
00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:39.167
<v Maddog:>meant that you would go to school

120
00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.951
<v Maddog:>for six months and then you would

121
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:43.294
<v Maddog:>work for six months and then go

122
00:05:43.354 --> 00:05:45.416
<v Maddog:>back to school for six months and

123
00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:46.598
<v Maddog:>work for six months.

124
00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.013
<v Maddog:>And the work was actually part of

125
00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:50.836
<v Maddog:>your education.

126
00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:54.326
<v Maddog:>Every time you finished a work cycle,

127
00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:56.369
<v Maddog:>you would have to write a report

128
00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.832
<v Maddog:>for the school about what you did

129
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.135
<v Maddog:>and what you learned and things like

130
00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:02.397
<v Maddog:>that and how was the job.

131
00:06:03.582 --> 00:06:05.906
<v Maddog:>And so I got a job at

132
00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:09.572
<v Maddog:>Western Electric Corporation, which was a manufacturing

133
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.116
<v Maddog:>arm of the telephone company.

134
00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:16.008
<v Maddog:>And we had, in our plant, we

135
00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:17.051
<v Maddog:>had over 4,000 people working.

136
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.003
<v Maddog:>It was a very large plant.

137
00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:24.010
<v Maddog:>We made all the wiring cable for

138
00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:25.975
<v Maddog:>the telephone company at the time.

139
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.723
<v Maddog:>And that included the cable that went

140
00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:31.627
<v Maddog:>underneath of the ocean, what we call

141
00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:36.132
<v Maddog:>long lines, to carry voice signals, telephone

142
00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:39.236
<v Maddog:>signals to Europe from the United States.

143
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.864
<v Maddog:>Large ships would come into the port

144
00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:45.389
<v Maddog:>right beside our plant and we would

145
00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:48.295
<v Maddog:>load these cables on large spools into

146
00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:49.136
<v Maddog:>the hold of the ship.

147
00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.186
<v Maddog:>And then the ship would go out

148
00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:53.452
<v Maddog:>and start laying the cable across the

149
00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:53.753
<v Maddog:>ocean.

150
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:57.304
<v Maddog:>So this was a very interesting place

151
00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:00.148
<v Maddog:>for a young electrical engineering student to

152
00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:05.014
<v Maddog:>learn about, in that time, how to

153
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:09.025
<v Maddog:>control these massive machines, the wiring cable

154
00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:11.232
<v Maddog:>in the telephone company.

155
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:16.565
<v Maddog:>During my first co-op trip that I

156
00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.467
<v Maddog:>was approached by one of the engineers

157
00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Maddog:>there and said, we have a correspondence

158
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.592
<v Maddog:>course in how to program this computer

159
00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:26.074
<v Maddog:>called an IBM 1130.

160
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.026
<v Maddog:>And do you want to take this

161
00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:30.387
<v Maddog:>course?

162
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:31.411
<v Maddog:>It is free.

163
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.503
<v Maddog:>So I said, sure, I'll take the

164
00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:36.225
<v Maddog:>course and I would read the book

165
00:07:36.285 --> 00:07:37.627
<v Maddog:>at night and then I would go

166
00:07:37.787 --> 00:07:40.030
<v Maddog:>in and practice at night and on

167
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.175
<v Maddog:>the weekends programming this IBM 1130, which

168
00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:45.937
<v Maddog:>they had in the engineering lab.

169
00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:49.246
<v Maddog:>That computer only had 4,000 16-bit words

170
00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:49.628
<v Maddog:>of memory.

171
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Maddog:>It had a one half megabyte disk

172
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.634
<v Maddog:>drive, hard disk drive.

173
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.628
<v Maddog:>I'll say that again for people.

174
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:04.632
<v Maddog:>One half megabyte of disk space.

175
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.389
<v Maddog:>And it had a paper tape reader

176
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:09.933
<v Maddog:>and punch and a printer.

177
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:13.143
<v Maddog:>And I would program this on punch

178
00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:16.708
<v Maddog:>cards and write programs to practice and

179
00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:18.811
<v Maddog:>then later on programs to help out

180
00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:22.215
<v Maddog:>the engineers in the facility with the

181
00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:23.236
<v Maddog:>work that they were doing.

182
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:26.907
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what was and when was your

183
00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Elisabetta Mori:>first program?

184
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.785
<v Maddog:>Well, like I said, this was 1969

185
00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:31.246
<v Maddog:>on this IBM.

186
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.522
<v Maddog:>So I don't remember what the first

187
00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:38.986
<v Maddog:>program was because I was reading this

188
00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Maddog:>book and it was taking us through

189
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:45.696
<v Maddog:>very simple programs into more complex programs.

190
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:48.585
<v Maddog:>But one of the programs that I

191
00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:51.329
<v Maddog:>wrote before I left, before I graduated

192
00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:53.875
<v Maddog:>from university was a course.

193
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.142
<v Maddog:>It's a program to do multiple regression

194
00:08:57.264 --> 00:09:03.271
<v Maddog:>analysis on wire from relating the physical

195
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.795
<v Maddog:>characteristics of wire to the electrical characteristics

196
00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:06.996
<v Maddog:>of wire.

197
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.364
<v Maddog:>So it was a very engineering-oriented scientific

198
00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:14.809
<v Maddog:>program that I had to jam all

199
00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:17.232
<v Maddog:>the data that I needed into this

200
00:09:17.252 --> 00:09:18.974
<v Maddog:>very small memory.

201
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.609
<v Maddog:>The IBM 1130 did not really have

202
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:26.031
<v Maddog:>an operating system.

203
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.124
<v Maddog:>When you wrote your program, you linked

204
00:09:29.224 --> 00:09:31.970
<v Maddog:>the device drivers into your program, not

205
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:33.293
<v Maddog:>into the operating system.

206
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.443
<v Maddog:>You booted your program to run on

207
00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:38.987
<v Maddog:>the computer and you could watch the

208
00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:41.771
<v Maddog:>lights on the front of the panel

209
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:44.875
<v Maddog:>to see how your program was going

210
00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:45.215
<v Maddog:>along.

211
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.521
<v Maddog:>And I could actually look after a

212
00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:48.903
<v Maddog:>while, I could look at the lights

213
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.045
<v Maddog:>on the front panel and figure out

214
00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Maddog:>whether my program was in an infinite

215
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.253
<v Maddog:>loop or whether my program was proceeding

216
00:09:56.313 --> 00:09:57.515
<v Maddog:>like it should be proceeding.

217
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.228
<v Maddog:>And it was a very interesting thing.

218
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.724
<v Maddog:>But of course, for a large portion

219
00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:05.066
<v Maddog:>of this time, I was still an

220
00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:06.491
<v Maddog:>electrical engineering student.

221
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.345
<v Maddog:>About halfway through my college education, I

222
00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:13.611
<v Maddog:>was doing more and more computing and

223
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.535
<v Maddog:>less and less electrical engineering.

224
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.843
<v Maddog:>So I made a choice to switch

225
00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:20.709
<v Maddog:>my curriculum to one that was half

226
00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:22.853
<v Maddog:>engineering and business.

227
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.601
<v Maddog:>And so because I had done most

228
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:28.264
<v Maddog:>of my engineering work, I then started

229
00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:34.309
<v Maddog:>studying accounting and marketing and management and

230
00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:36.712
<v Maddog:>things like that, as well as having

231
00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:41.356
<v Maddog:>my courses in physics and statistical analysis

232
00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:42.337
<v Maddog:>and things like that.

233
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.021
<v Maddog:>So I really had a basis of

234
00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:47.485
<v Maddog:>both sides of the world, the technical

235
00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:50.089
<v Maddog:>side and the business side, when I

236
00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:52.357
<v Maddog:>graduated with my degree in 1973.

237
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.325
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And so in 1973, you worked at

238
00:10:58.565 --> 00:11:01.712
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford, Connecticut.

239
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.406
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Then you had another IBM computer, but

240
00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.334
<v Elisabetta Mori:>this time was a 360, 370, right?

241
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.682
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Well, let's go back slightly back to

242
00:11:12.742 --> 00:11:15.464
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Drexel for a moment, because as I

243
00:11:15.505 --> 00:11:17.728
<v Elisabetta Mori:>started to get into computers, I found

244
00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Elisabetta Mori:>out that there was this laboratory at

245
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.253
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Drexel where they had digital PDP computers,

246
00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:27.118
<v Elisabetta Mori:>PDP8s and Link8s and things like that.

247
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.105
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And again, this was a case where

248
00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:33.189
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I wasn't actually taking a course in

249
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.173
<v Elisabetta Mori:>how to program these, but I was

250
00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:36.776
<v Elisabetta Mori:>learning this on my own.

251
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:39.364
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I would be given a book on

252
00:11:39.424 --> 00:11:43.612
<v Elisabetta Mori:>how to program in assembly language, and

253
00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:45.775
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I taught myself how to do that.

254
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.827
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I taught myself binary arithmetic by reading

255
00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Elisabetta Mori:>books and then practicing.

256
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.028
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And I started the Drexel Computer Club

257
00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.034
<v Elisabetta Mori:>while I was there.

258
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.665
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I created a computer club.

259
00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.370
<v Elisabetta Mori:>We got together and we shared ideas

260
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:04.214
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and thoughts and things.

261
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.324
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And so when I said my degree

262
00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:10.729
<v Elisabetta Mori:>was in commerce and engineering, there was

263
00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:13.193
<v Elisabetta Mori:>a very strong minor in this thing

264
00:12:13.293 --> 00:12:14.876
<v Elisabetta Mori:>called data processing.

265
00:12:15.741 --> 00:12:17.646
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It wasn't computer science back in those

266
00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:18.007
<v Elisabetta Mori:>days.

267
00:12:18.568 --> 00:12:20.512
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It was more like computer black magic.

268
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.724
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And so you got, you know, in

269
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.766
<v Elisabetta Mori:>fact, I had a professor tell me

270
00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:29.971
<v Elisabetta Mori:>from Drexel, tell me, "John, you will

271
00:12:30.052 --> 00:12:31.814
<v Elisabetta Mori:>never be able to have a job

272
00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:35.242
<v Elisabetta Mori:>as a professional programmer." Because back in

273
00:12:35.283 --> 00:12:38.651
<v Elisabetta Mori:>those days, there were very few professional

274
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:39.453
<v Elisabetta Mori:>programmers.

275
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.907
<v Elisabetta Mori:>When you wrote a program, it's because

276
00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:46.092
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you were a physicist and you needed

277
00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:48.315
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the program for your physics.

278
00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:50.948
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You were an electrical engineer and you

279
00:12:50.988 --> 00:12:53.054
<v Elisabetta Mori:>needed the program for your electronics.

280
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.107
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You were a chemist and you needed

281
00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the program for your chemistry.

282
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.185
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You were an educator and you needed

283
00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:01.691
<v Elisabetta Mori:>this program to help you with your

284
00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:02.253
<v Elisabetta Mori:>education.

285
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:05.907
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Very, very few people had a job

286
00:13:05.947 --> 00:13:08.373
<v Elisabetta Mori:>description of programmer.

287
00:13:09.982 --> 00:13:13.189
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, you know, we had a minor

288
00:13:13.671 --> 00:13:15.035
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in programming.

289
00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And that's what I graduated with.

290
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.424
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So then I got my job with

291
00:13:21.444 --> 00:13:26.834
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Aetna and Aetna was the world's company

292
00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:27.916
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in the world.

293
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:29.702
<v Elisabetta Mori:>They were huge.

294
00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:34.190
<v Elisabetta Mori:>They had a building that was two

295
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.455
<v Elisabetta Mori:>city blocks long, eight stories tall.

296
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.266
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And it had a huge data center

297
00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:43.670
<v Elisabetta Mori:>that was four levels below the ground

298
00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:45.174
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and four levels above.

299
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.966
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And they automatically ordered two of everything

300
00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Elisabetta Mori:>that IBM announced, whether it was a

301
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:55.395
<v Elisabetta Mori:>new tape drive or new mainframe.

302
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.184
<v Elisabetta Mori:>IBM announced it.

303
00:13:57.867 --> 00:13:58.791
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Aetna ordered two.

304
00:13:59.862 --> 00:14:01.808
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And one went to our research division

305
00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:03.291
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to figure out how we were going

306
00:14:03.332 --> 00:14:03.713
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to use it.

307
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:05.543
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And the other one went to the

308
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.329
<v Elisabetta Mori:>computer floor because we knew we were

309
00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:09.853
<v Elisabetta Mori:>going to use it sooner or later.

310
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.525
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And when they hired me, they saw

311
00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:17.332
<v Elisabetta Mori:>that I had taught myself machine language

312
00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:18.694
<v Elisabetta Mori:>programming for the PDP-8.

313
00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:21.126
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And they said, "do you think you

314
00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:23.412
<v Elisabetta Mori:>could learn machine language programming for the

315
00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:26.974
<v Elisabetta Mori:>IBM?" And I rather brashly said, "well,

316
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.444
<v Elisabetta Mori:>do you have a book?" And they

317
00:14:30.525 --> 00:14:32.371
<v Elisabetta Mori:>thought that the world of that answer.

318
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So they hired me for the job.

319
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.161
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And I worked for them from 1973

320
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:44.270
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to 1977, doing mostly machine language, assembly

321
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.534
<v Elisabetta Mori:>language programming for IBM systems.

322
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.324
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And during the same years, you also

323
00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:55.051
<v Elisabetta Mori:>got a master in computer science earned

324
00:14:55.092 --> 00:14:55.493
<v Elisabetta Mori:>at night.

325
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:56.820
<v Maddog:>Yes.

326
00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:01.008
<v Maddog:>There was a huge number of insurance

327
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:05.676
<v Maddog:>companies in Hartford, Connecticut, the Hartford Travelers.

328
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.406
<v Maddog:>They all competed with each other, but

329
00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:10.571
<v Maddog:>they all realized that they needed certain

330
00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:11.533
<v Maddog:>things in common.

331
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.204
<v Maddog:>And so they got together and went

332
00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Maddog:>to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy,

333
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.956
<v Maddog:>New York and said to have our

334
00:15:20.996 --> 00:15:25.727
<v Maddog:>computer people trained more in computer science

335
00:15:26.568 --> 00:15:30.314
<v Maddog:>and how do you actively write programs

336
00:15:30.574 --> 00:15:31.476
<v Maddog:>for these computers.

337
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.683
<v Maddog:>And we want you to open up

338
00:15:33.844 --> 00:15:37.412
<v Maddog:>a branch of RPI in Hartford called

339
00:15:37.452 --> 00:15:39.857
<v Maddog:>the Hartford Graduate School.

340
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:41.505
<v Maddog:>And the only course you're going to

341
00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.572
<v Maddog:>teach is a master's degree in computer

342
00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:45.012
<v Maddog:>science.

343
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:47.909
<v Maddog:>And RPI agreed to that.

344
00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.704
<v Maddog:>And because they knew that all of

345
00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:53.108
<v Maddog:>these insurance companies would be sending their

346
00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:56.213
<v Maddog:>computer people to get their master's degree

347
00:15:56.814 --> 00:15:58.016
<v Maddog:>at this graduate center.

348
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.844
<v Maddog:>So there will be a huge influx

349
00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:02.452
<v Maddog:>of students to be trained.

350
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:06.667
<v Maddog:>And I went there starting in nineteen

351
00:16:06.747 --> 00:16:10.113
<v Maddog:>seventy five, maybe seventy four.

352
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.443
<v Maddog:>And it took me three years at

353
00:16:12.523 --> 00:16:15.771
<v Maddog:>night to get my master's degree in

354
00:16:15.812 --> 00:16:16.654
<v Maddog:>computer science.

355
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.295
<v Maddog:>And I graduated in 1977.

356
00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Maddog:>So I would I would go there

357
00:16:23.371 --> 00:16:25.233
<v Maddog:>two nights a week, study.

358
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.703
<v Maddog:>But in reality, I did all my

359
00:16:27.843 --> 00:16:32.471
<v Maddog:>programming on Aetna's computers because the Hartford

360
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:35.361
<v Maddog:>Graduate Center only had a remote job

361
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.851
<v Maddog:>entry link to their computers in Troy,

362
00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:39.312
<v Maddog:>New York.

363
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.365
<v Maddog:>But Aetna had all of this computing

364
00:16:43.445 --> 00:16:46.210
<v Maddog:>power that at night was available to

365
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.714
<v Maddog:>me to do my programming jobs.

366
00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:52.664
<v Maddog:>So that was that was no.

367
00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.449
<v Maddog:>And what I learned in that wasn't

368
00:16:55.489 --> 00:16:57.593
<v Maddog:>so much I learned a lot from

369
00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:02.305
<v Maddog:>the courses themselves, but it reinforced what

370
00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Maddog:>I had learned from working on my

371
00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:07.335
<v Maddog:>job and doing that type of work.

372
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:12.130
<v Maddog:>Back in those days, relational databases were

373
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.413
<v Maddog:>just starting to be used.

374
00:17:14.621 --> 00:17:17.267
<v Maddog:>And Aetna was very much a user

375
00:17:17.448 --> 00:17:18.892
<v Maddog:>of these type of databases.

376
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.985
<v Maddog:>James Martin, come in and talk to

377
00:17:23.086 --> 00:17:26.935
<v Maddog:>us directly about the use of databases.

378
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.086
<v Maddog:>We had Ed Jordan, who and Larry

379
00:17:30.126 --> 00:17:33.915
<v Maddog:>Constantine, who did structured programming, invented structured

380
00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:34.495
<v Maddog:>programming.

381
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:37.426
<v Maddog:>They came and talked to us about

382
00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:40.932
<v Maddog:>structured programming and saw the beginnings of

383
00:17:41.032 --> 00:17:42.255
<v Maddog:>software engineering.

384
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.385
<v Maddog:>So these were very heady days.

385
00:17:46.307 --> 00:17:49.033
<v Maddog:>And Aetna being so big and so

386
00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:49.634
<v Maddog:>powerful.

387
00:17:50.902 --> 00:17:53.828
<v Maddog:>They demanded the source code for the

388
00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.893
<v Maddog:>operating systems from IBM.

389
00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.025
<v Maddog:>If Aetna bought any software, they demanded

390
00:18:01.085 --> 00:18:03.728
<v Maddog:>the source code of that software to

391
00:18:03.769 --> 00:18:06.312
<v Maddog:>be put in escrow just in case

392
00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:08.476
<v Maddog:>that company would go out of business.

393
00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:11.483
<v Maddog:>So, you know, if you want to

394
00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.047
<v Maddog:>sell something to Aetna, you had to

395
00:18:14.107 --> 00:18:16.191
<v Maddog:>be willing to put your source code

396
00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:19.456
<v Maddog:>into escrow, in case something happened.

397
00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:22.726
<v Maddog:>And back in those days, when you

398
00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:25.312
<v Maddog:>bought a software package, like maybe a

399
00:18:25.373 --> 00:18:28.204
<v Maddog:>new compiler, you might pay one hundred

400
00:18:28.304 --> 00:18:30.868
<v Maddog:>thousand dollars for that compiler to go

401
00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:33.774
<v Maddog:>in one system used by one person

402
00:18:33.914 --> 00:18:34.515
<v Maddog:>at a time.

403
00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:38.789
<v Maddog:>And you would negotiate that contract for

404
00:18:38.989 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Maddog:>months.

405
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.703
<v Maddog:>I should also say that in those

406
00:18:42.803 --> 00:18:46.489
<v Maddog:>days, you could not apply software copyright

407
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.673
<v Maddog:>or software, you could not apply copyright

408
00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:50.016
<v Maddog:>or patents to software.

409
00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.446
<v Maddog:>That did not happen until the mid

410
00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:52.487
<v Maddog:>1980s.

411
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.224
<v Maddog:>And consequently, the protection of software in

412
00:18:58.284 --> 00:19:01.688
<v Maddog:>those days was done either by trade

413
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:05.575
<v Maddog:>secrets or by software contract.

414
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.583
<v Maddog:>And that contract was negotiated between you

415
00:19:10.085 --> 00:19:14.131
<v Maddog:>and the company and might take months

416
00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:15.033
<v Maddog:>to do.

417
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.884
<v Maddog:>So we paid one hundred thousand dollars

418
00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Maddog:>for one compiler to go on one

419
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.593
<v Maddog:>system and use it one person at

420
00:19:24.634 --> 00:19:24.994
<v Maddog:>a time.

421
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.707
<v Maddog:>And when we bought that compiler, this

422
00:19:29.807 --> 00:19:33.053
<v Maddog:>magnetic tape showed up with an engineer

423
00:19:33.114 --> 00:19:33.795
<v Maddog:>attached to it.

424
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:37.325
<v Maddog:>That engineer would spend a week at

425
00:19:37.366 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Maddog:>our facility trying to get their software

426
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:41.934
<v Maddog:>to work properly on our system.

427
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.005
<v Maddog:>And then they would run some tests

428
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.011
<v Maddog:>to show us it was working properly.

429
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.584
<v Maddog:>And then the engineer would say, "OK,

430
00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:51.612
<v Maddog:>I'm going to take my tape back

431
00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:52.921
<v Maddog:>to my company." And we would say,

432
00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:55.585
<v Maddog:>no, you're going to take that tape

433
00:19:55.845 --> 00:19:57.727
<v Maddog:>and put that in a safe in

434
00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:02.054
<v Maddog:>escrow just in case your miserable little

435
00:20:02.114 --> 00:20:03.376
<v Maddog:>company goes out of business.

436
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.925
<v Maddog:>We're Aetna and you're not.

437
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:09.782
<v Maddog:>Go ahead.

438
00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:11.167
<v Elisabetta Mori:>No, no, no.

439
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.943
<v Maddog:>To give you a better idea, we

440
00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:21.045
<v Maddog:>had five hundred thousand magnetic tapes, 12

441
00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:24.968
<v Maddog:>inch magnetic tapes in our tape library

442
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.073
<v Maddog:>on site with another one hundred thousand

443
00:20:29.153 --> 00:20:32.816
<v Maddog:>tapes in software storage in a salt

444
00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:34.016
<v Maddog:>mine in Idaho.

445
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.744
<v Maddog:>We had, I worked personally on a

446
00:20:38.924 --> 00:20:43.028
<v Maddog:>file, one file of one program on

447
00:20:43.229 --> 00:20:47.433
<v Maddog:>one system that had five hundred IBM

448
00:20:47.573 --> 00:20:49.576
<v Maddog:>thirty three thirty disk drives hooked up

449
00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:49.876
<v Maddog:>to it.

450
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.762
<v Maddog:>And each one of those thirty three

451
00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:55.667
<v Maddog:>thirty disk drives cost thirty two thousand

452
00:20:55.828 --> 00:20:59.494
<v Maddog:>US dollars in nineteen seventy five.

453
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.543
<v Maddog:>I had to write the disk driver

454
00:21:03.624 --> 00:21:06.268
<v Maddog:>for it because IBM had no disk

455
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.932
<v Maddog:>driver that could support that many disk

456
00:21:08.972 --> 00:21:10.474
<v Maddog:>drives at one time.

457
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.024
<v Maddog:>And IBM had to give us the

458
00:21:15.064 --> 00:21:18.329
<v Maddog:>source code for their operating systems because

459
00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.791
<v Maddog:>that's the only way we would do

460
00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:20.552
<v Maddog:>business with them.

461
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.125
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what happened when what brought you

462
00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:34.351
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to move from Aetna to to have

463
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:37.535
<v Elisabetta Mori:>your teaching experience at the Hartford State

464
00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:38.636
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Technical College?

465
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.683
<v Maddog:>Well, well, first of all, I had

466
00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:48.030
<v Maddog:>always wanted to teach, told the supervisor

467
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.514
<v Maddog:>at Etna many times and I got

468
00:21:51.574 --> 00:21:52.941
<v Maddog:>my degree in 1970.

469
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:57.046
<v Maddog:>My supervisor came over to me and

470
00:21:57.288 --> 00:21:59.734
<v Maddog:>with a newspaper and said, "John, look

471
00:21:59.774 --> 00:22:03.105
<v Maddog:>at this." There's an advertisement for a

472
00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:07.151
<v Maddog:>professor at this little state technical college

473
00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:09.514
<v Maddog:>that was very close to where Etna

474
00:22:09.555 --> 00:22:09.796
<v Maddog:>was.

475
00:22:10.823 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Maddog:>He said, "I know you've always wanted

476
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.152
<v Maddog:>to teach.

477
00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:15.164
<v Maddog:>Why don't you take a look at

478
00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:19.132
<v Maddog:>this technical college and see if you

479
00:22:19.312 --> 00:22:22.606
<v Maddog:>if it's interesting to you." So I

480
00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:23.911
<v Maddog:>took the day off of work.

481
00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:27.888
<v Maddog:>I went over to the technical and

482
00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:31.596
<v Maddog:>I didn't apply to the office.

483
00:22:31.596 --> 00:22:33.510
<v Maddog:>I didn't take my resume into them

484
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.151
<v Maddog:>immediately.

485
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:39.029
<v Maddog:>Instead, I just wandered around the computer

486
00:22:39.069 --> 00:22:42.094
<v Maddog:>science part of the college and talked

487
00:22:42.134 --> 00:22:43.136
<v Maddog:>with some of the students.

488
00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:46.230
<v Maddog:>I got the college catalog, which talked

489
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.615
<v Maddog:>about the courses they had.

490
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:49.787
<v Maddog:>I looked at the equipment which they

491
00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:51.352
<v Maddog:>had in their computer lab.

492
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.104
<v Maddog:>And back in those days, every other

493
00:22:55.224 --> 00:22:58.268
<v Maddog:>single state technical college in the state

494
00:22:58.288 --> 00:23:01.954
<v Maddog:>of Connecticut would have an RJD link

495
00:23:02.454 --> 00:23:04.037
<v Maddog:>to the University of Connecticut.

496
00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:05.486
<v Maddog:>And they would punch cards.

497
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:10.888
<v Maddog:>This college had a PDP 1170 from

498
00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:14.534
<v Maddog:>DEC that ran a time sharing operating

499
00:23:14.574 --> 00:23:16.196
<v Maddog:>system called Vistas E.

500
00:23:17.384 --> 00:23:20.053
<v Maddog:>It had 13 terminals in the computer

501
00:23:20.093 --> 00:23:20.334
<v Maddog:>lab.

502
00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:25.894
<v Maddog:>It had a separate digital PDP 1134

503
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.395
<v Maddog:>single user computer with a graphics tube

504
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.297
<v Maddog:>and a light pen.

505
00:23:32.223 --> 00:23:34.247
<v Maddog:>It had a flatbed plotter for people

506
00:23:34.328 --> 00:23:36.413
<v Maddog:>to plot out designs and things.

507
00:23:37.623 --> 00:23:39.030
<v Maddog:>And I looked at the program.

508
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.512
<v Maddog:>I looked at the computer system.

509
00:23:42.163 --> 00:23:43.628
<v Maddog:>I talked with the students and I

510
00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:44.672
<v Maddog:>liked all of them.

511
00:23:46.102 --> 00:23:49.548
<v Maddog:>So I then applied for the job

512
00:23:50.189 --> 00:23:53.794
<v Maddog:>of a teacher there at the school.

513
00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:58.994
<v Maddog:>And they accepted my resume.

514
00:24:00.304 --> 00:24:01.749
<v Maddog:>I then went back to Aetna and

515
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:03.695
<v Maddog:>told my boss, thank you very much.

516
00:24:03.695 --> 00:24:05.629
<v Maddog:>I I decided to leave Aetna and

517
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.152
<v Maddog:>go teach.

518
00:24:07.423 --> 00:24:08.205
<v Maddog:>I had to take a $3,000 cut

519
00:24:08.245 --> 00:24:08.986
<v Maddog:>in pay to go teach at the

520
00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:09.187
<v Maddog:>school.

521
00:24:13.102 --> 00:24:15.907
<v Maddog:>And of course, the teaching at the

522
00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:18.252
<v Maddog:>school for that amount of money meant

523
00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:20.016
<v Maddog:>I was teaching nine months of the

524
00:24:20.056 --> 00:24:20.256
<v Maddog:>year.

525
00:24:21.101 --> 00:24:22.424
<v Maddog:>If I taught at night, if I

526
00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:27.031
<v Maddog:>taught during this course salary, but I

527
00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:29.375
<v Maddog:>did eventually take a cut in pay

528
00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:30.036
<v Maddog:>to go teach.

529
00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:33.067
<v Maddog:>But it was a wonderful three and

530
00:24:33.107 --> 00:24:35.793
<v Maddog:>a half years teaching at that school.

531
00:24:37.002 --> 00:24:39.026
<v Maddog:>And I'm still in touch with many

532
00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:42.193
<v Maddog:>of the students that I taught at

533
00:24:42.374 --> 00:24:42.955
<v Maddog:>at that school.

534
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.766
<v Maddog:>Some of them didn't receive any more

535
00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Maddog:>formal education than what they got at

536
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:51.613
<v Maddog:>Hartford State Technical College.

537
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.264
<v Maddog:>We took, you know, in those days,

538
00:24:56.066 --> 00:24:59.072
<v Maddog:>most of the students had never seen

539
00:24:59.132 --> 00:25:00.234
<v Maddog:>a computer in real life.

540
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.065
<v Maddog:>They saw them on TV.

541
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.044
<v Maddog:>They saw them if they went with

542
00:25:05.104 --> 00:25:08.371
<v Maddog:>their parents to, you know, at work.

543
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.269
<v Maddog:>But there were no computers in the

544
00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:12.510
<v Maddog:>home.

545
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.283
<v Maddog:>There were very few computers in high

546
00:25:15.323 --> 00:25:18.547
<v Maddog:>schools that when they came and put

547
00:25:18.587 --> 00:25:20.751
<v Maddog:>their hands on the keyboard in my

548
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:23.114
<v Maddog:>lab was the first time they'd actually

549
00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:24.495
<v Maddog:>touched a computer keyboard.

550
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:28.024
<v Maddog:>And from that in two years, we

551
00:25:28.064 --> 00:25:29.406
<v Maddog:>took them to the point where they

552
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:31.649
<v Maddog:>could program in several different high level

553
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.135
<v Maddog:>languages, at least one assembly language.

554
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.006
<v Maddog:>And they also knew how to program

555
00:25:39.046 --> 00:25:42.252
<v Maddog:>a database, a simple operating system and

556
00:25:42.292 --> 00:25:43.274
<v Maddog:>a simple compiler.

557
00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:47.010
<v Maddog:>So I was very proud of the

558
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.531
<v Maddog:>program.

559
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.128
<v Maddog:>I'm not, I don't take credit for

560
00:25:50.168 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Maddog:>the program.

561
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.905
<v Maddog:>It was set up by the professor

562
00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Maddog:>in front of me, a person by

563
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.673
<v Maddog:>the name of Graham Buntz.

564
00:25:56.762 --> 00:25:59.148
<v Maddog:>But Graham had to leave the school

565
00:25:59.189 --> 00:26:00.452
<v Maddog:>because of health problems.

566
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.963
<v Maddog:>And I took over.

567
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.065
<v Maddog:>I was very soon I was made

568
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.392
<v Maddog:>the department head of the program.

569
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.582
<v Maddog:>And I stayed being the department head

570
00:26:10.642 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Maddog:>until I left in 1977.

571
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:21.709
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Where does your nickname "Maddog" come from?

572
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.763
<v Maddog:>I was afraid you were going to

573
00:26:24.904 --> 00:26:25.286
<v Maddog:>ask that.

574
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.606
<v Maddog:>I'll try and tell this as quickly

575
00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:28.349
<v Maddog:>as possible.

576
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.803
<v Maddog:>While I was teaching there at the

577
00:26:30.863 --> 00:26:34.769
<v Maddog:>school, I sometimes got into arguments with

578
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:37.053
<v Maddog:>the dean of instruction about the proper

579
00:26:37.113 --> 00:26:38.455
<v Maddog:>way of teaching students.

580
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:41.787
<v Maddog:>And sometimes these arguments would get very

581
00:26:41.928 --> 00:26:43.392
<v Maddog:>heated, very hot.

582
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.006
<v Maddog:>And sometimes they were too hot for

583
00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:47.591
<v Maddog:>bad dogs and Englishmen.

584
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.608
<v Maddog:>After the old Noel Cowell play, the

585
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:55.513
<v Maddog:>dean was British and then I was

586
00:26:55.553 --> 00:26:56.194
<v Maddog:>the mad dog.

587
00:26:57.962 --> 00:26:59.746
<v Maddog:>And I know people looking at me

588
00:26:59.787 --> 00:27:01.954
<v Maddog:>today say, oh, mad dog, you're really

589
00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:02.214
<v Maddog:>nice.

590
00:27:02.742 --> 00:27:03.586
<v Maddog:>You're kind.

591
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:05.433
<v Maddog:>You tell great stories and stuff.

592
00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:07.428
<v Maddog:>How did you get that name?

593
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:10.550
<v Maddog:>But they didn't know me at that

594
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.870
<v Maddog:>time.

595
00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:14.225
<v Maddog:>I was 27 years old and I

596
00:27:14.285 --> 00:27:17.391
<v Maddog:>had this very bad temper that sometimes

597
00:27:17.892 --> 00:27:19.675
<v Maddog:>I would open up and people would

598
00:27:19.735 --> 00:27:19.976
<v Maddog:>see it.

599
00:27:20.804 --> 00:27:22.211
<v Maddog:>And I still have the temper.

600
00:27:23.022 --> 00:27:24.786
<v Maddog:>But what I found out was that

601
00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Maddog:>if you lose your temper, you lose

602
00:27:26.951 --> 00:27:27.612
<v Maddog:>the argument.

603
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.405
<v Maddog:>And so now my strategy is that

604
00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:33.428
<v Maddog:>I make other people lose their temper.

605
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.681
<v Maddog:>And it works.

606
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:38.825
<v Maddog:>It's worked several times that I have

607
00:27:38.945 --> 00:27:41.408
<v Maddog:>won an argument by making other people

608
00:27:41.469 --> 00:27:42.171
<v Maddog:>lose their temper.

609
00:27:45.702 --> 00:27:49.151
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So you stayed in school for three

610
00:27:49.191 --> 00:27:49.492
<v Elisabetta Mori:>years.

611
00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:52.004
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And then what changed?

612
00:27:53.209 --> 00:27:53.891
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What happened?

613
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.889
<v Maddog:>Well, a couple of things happened.

614
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.431
<v Maddog:>Quite frankly, I was spending more money

615
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:01.053
<v Maddog:>than I made.

616
00:28:01.641 --> 00:28:04.747
<v Maddog:>I was going deeper into debt and

617
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Maddog:>I didn't see any real path out

618
00:28:06.971 --> 00:28:07.332
<v Maddog:>of that.

619
00:28:09.761 --> 00:28:12.666
<v Maddog:>And I had a student who graduated

620
00:28:12.686 --> 00:28:15.912
<v Maddog:>in the electrical engineering part, electrical technology

621
00:28:15.952 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Maddog:>part of the school, that he had

622
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.789
<v Maddog:>gotten a job at Bell Laboratories in

623
00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:22.952
<v Maddog:>Massachusetts.

624
00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:26.385
<v Maddog:>And he said to me, "Maddog, they're

625
00:28:26.426 --> 00:28:29.092
<v Maddog:>looking for a UNIX systems administrator there.

626
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.025
<v Maddog:>Why don't you actually they're looking for

627
00:28:32.146 --> 00:28:34.452
<v Maddog:>an administrator there, systems administrator there.

628
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.265
<v Maddog:>Why don't you apply?" Now, that other

629
00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:43.469
<v Maddog:>than my mother and my father, every

630
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:49.182
<v Maddog:>single person in my family, my grandmother,

631
00:28:49.502 --> 00:28:52.768
<v Maddog:>my aunt, my aunt's husband, my brother,

632
00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:55.754
<v Maddog:>my sister-in-law, and I, of course, worked

633
00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:56.715
<v Maddog:>for Wester Electric.

634
00:28:57.782 --> 00:29:00.229
<v Maddog:>So working for the telephone company was

635
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:01.553
<v Maddog:>something that was in my blood.

636
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.062
<v Maddog:>And to go to work for Bell

637
00:29:04.123 --> 00:29:08.288
<v Maddog:>Laboratories, who had this huge reputation in

638
00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:12.313
<v Maddog:>the scientific research field, was was very,

639
00:29:12.394 --> 00:29:13.135
<v Maddog:>very tempting.

640
00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:17.431
<v Maddog:>So I went up to the Bell

641
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:18.254
<v Maddog:>Labs facility.

642
00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:21.125
<v Maddog:>I I started the interviewing process and

643
00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:22.868
<v Maddog:>they said, "we want you to be

644
00:29:22.908 --> 00:29:25.631
<v Maddog:>the systems administrator of a cyber 720

645
00:29:26.614 --> 00:29:30.125
<v Maddog:>computer system." Now, there's a lot of

646
00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:33.293
<v Maddog:>people who think that UNIX is unfriendly.

647
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Maddog:>Well, the CDC cyber knew there were

648
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.694
<v Maddog:>users out there and it hated them.

649
00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:43.826
<v Maddog:>And so it was a very complex

650
00:29:43.966 --> 00:29:46.933
<v Maddog:>operating system that, you know, there were

651
00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:48.216
<v Maddog:>very few of them around.

652
00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:49.763
<v Maddog:>And I looked at this and I

653
00:29:49.844 --> 00:29:52.329
<v Maddog:>said, "no, I don't really want to

654
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:54.633
<v Maddog:>be the systems administrator for the cyber.

655
00:29:55.401 --> 00:29:57.107
<v Maddog:>I want to be the systems administrator

656
00:29:57.187 --> 00:30:00.081
<v Maddog:>for your UNIX systems." And they said,

657
00:30:00.081 --> 00:30:02.765
<v Maddog:>"well, we already have two people doing

658
00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:05.468
<v Maddog:>that job and we don't really, you

659
00:30:05.489 --> 00:30:07.693
<v Maddog:>know, we don't think that we want

660
00:30:07.713 --> 00:30:09.294
<v Maddog:>you to be the systems administrator of

661
00:30:09.335 --> 00:30:11.601
<v Maddog:>the cyber." And I said, "I'm sorry,

662
00:30:11.622 --> 00:30:13.745
<v Maddog:>if you don't want me to be

663
00:30:13.786 --> 00:30:16.111
<v Maddog:>the systems administrator of the UNIX systems,

664
00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:18.275
<v Maddog:>then I don't want to work for

665
00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.944
<v Maddog:>you." And it was like shock on

666
00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:22.728
<v Maddog:>their faces that somebody had told them

667
00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:24.091
<v Maddog:>that they didn't want to work for

668
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:25.093
<v Maddog:>Bell Laboratories.

669
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.644
<v Maddog:>But I knew that Bell Laboratories had

670
00:30:29.704 --> 00:30:33.328
<v Maddog:>developed UNIX and I knew that if

671
00:30:33.468 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Maddog:>I was going to be a systems

672
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.374
<v Maddog:>administrator, I would have access to everything

673
00:30:38.915 --> 00:30:40.416
<v Maddog:>that was in UNIX.

674
00:30:41.582 --> 00:30:42.949
<v Maddog:>And that's what I wanted to be.

675
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.082
<v Maddog:>I could see a future for UNIX,

676
00:30:45.624 --> 00:30:47.127
<v Maddog:>but I did not see a future

677
00:30:47.528 --> 00:30:50.794
<v Maddog:>for Cyber 720 and the NOS operating

678
00:30:50.854 --> 00:30:51.194
<v Maddog:>system.

679
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:54.325
<v Maddog:>So I went back to the school.

680
00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:56.129
<v Maddog:>I was back there about a week.

681
00:30:56.551 --> 00:30:57.994
<v Maddog:>Bell Labs called me up again.

682
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.860
<v Maddog:>They said, "Mr.

683
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:01.544
<v Maddog:>Hall, we're going to have we're going

684
00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Maddog:>to buy a contract from CDC, but

685
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.453
<v Maddog:>we want you to be the systems

686
00:31:06.493 --> 00:31:08.195
<v Maddog:>administrator of the UNIX system.

687
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:11.441
<v Maddog:>Have you ever used UNIX before?" "No.

688
00:31:13.825 --> 00:31:15.369
<v Maddog:>But do you have a book about

689
00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:18.342
<v Maddog:>it?" And so between the time I

690
00:31:18.403 --> 00:31:20.929
<v Maddog:>accepted the job and read, I read

691
00:31:20.969 --> 00:31:21.651
<v Maddog:>a lot about UNIX.

692
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.865
<v Maddog:>And when I went there, they sent

693
00:31:24.905 --> 00:31:26.429
<v Maddog:>me to a UNIX class for a

694
00:31:26.489 --> 00:31:26.670
<v Maddog:>week.

695
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.725
<v Maddog:>And then I became the UNIX systems

696
00:31:29.745 --> 00:31:30.306
<v Maddog:>administrator.

697
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.723
<v Maddog:>And I stayed there for three and

698
00:31:33.743 --> 00:31:35.767
<v Maddog:>a half years before I had a

699
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:38.432
<v Maddog:>job offer from Digital Equipment Corporation.

700
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.528
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Where was the job for Digital Equipment?

701
00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:43.351
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Which city?

702
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.764
<v Maddog:>Well, it was very close because Digital

703
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:50.468
<v Maddog:>had a headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, and

704
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.394
<v Maddog:>Bell Labs was in North Andover, Massachusetts.

705
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.248
<v Maddog:>I then, you know, these were development

706
00:31:59.328 --> 00:32:03.641
<v Maddog:>part of actually in Maryland, I'm sure,

707
00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:06.207
<v Maddog:>and they were building a new facility

708
00:32:06.628 --> 00:32:09.153
<v Maddog:>in Nashua, New Hampshire, which is very

709
00:32:09.213 --> 00:32:10.015
<v Maddog:>close to where I live.

710
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:12.544
<v Maddog:>So for the first couple of months,

711
00:32:13.065 --> 00:32:15.690
<v Maddog:>I lived in my house in Massachusetts

712
00:32:16.231 --> 00:32:18.395
<v Maddog:>and then worked in New Hampshire.

713
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.287
<v Maddog:>But then I moved into an apartment

714
00:32:22.327 --> 00:32:24.732
<v Maddog:>in New Hampshire and stayed there for

715
00:32:24.752 --> 00:32:25.474
<v Maddog:>a number of years.

716
00:32:26.682 --> 00:32:28.128
<v Maddog:>So it was very close to where

717
00:32:28.168 --> 00:32:28.469
<v Maddog:>I was.

718
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.366
<v Maddog:>But Digital was starting up a new

719
00:32:32.706 --> 00:32:34.889
<v Maddog:>UNIX group and they were going to

720
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.515
<v Maddog:>be developing their own version of UNIX.

721
00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:40.488
<v Maddog:>And so I was, of course, very

722
00:32:40.628 --> 00:32:41.973
<v Maddog:>interested in doing this.

723
00:32:42.781 --> 00:32:43.983
<v Maddog:>And that's where I joined.

724
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.107
<v Maddog:>I joined Digital to do that work.

725
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.526
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And so you started working for Digital

726
00:32:53.566 --> 00:32:55.736
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Equipment Corporation in 1983.

727
00:32:57.641 --> 00:33:00.488
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So there is something that at some

728
00:33:00.548 --> 00:33:01.916
<v Elisabetta Mori:>point happens in 1994.

729
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.230
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what was that?

730
00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:09.525
<v Maddog:>OK, so when we start, when I

731
00:33:09.546 --> 00:33:13.159
<v Maddog:>started working for Digital in 1983, at

732
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.387
<v Maddog:>that point, a lot of different companies

733
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.973
<v Maddog:>were dabbling in UNIX.

734
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.147
<v Maddog:>They weren't really happy about UNIX because

735
00:33:23.328 --> 00:33:25.774
<v Maddog:>they had their own proprietary operating systems.

736
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.248
<v Maddog:>You know, IBM had MVS and VMCMS

737
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:35.614
<v Maddog:>and Hewlett Packard had MPE as their

738
00:33:35.694 --> 00:33:36.456
<v Maddog:>operating system.

739
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.528
<v Maddog:>And Digital, of course, had VMS, their

740
00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:42.453
<v Maddog:>pride and joy of the VAX system.

741
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.463
<v Maddog:>And they had a wide range of

742
00:33:44.684 --> 00:33:46.968
<v Maddog:>different operating systems on the PDP-11.

743
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.985
<v Maddog:>They had VistaC, which I was familiar

744
00:33:51.045 --> 00:33:51.286
<v Maddog:>with.

745
00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:53.813
<v Maddog:>They had RT-11, which I was familiar

746
00:33:53.873 --> 00:33:54.034
<v Maddog:>with.

747
00:33:54.541 --> 00:33:56.587
<v Maddog:>They had various different types of UNIX

748
00:33:56.647 --> 00:33:57.068
<v Maddog:>systems.

749
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.445
<v Maddog:>But what happened was this company called

750
00:34:01.565 --> 00:34:05.053
<v Maddog:>Sun Microsystems decided that they were going

751
00:34:05.073 --> 00:34:06.941
<v Maddog:>to bring out a system that that

752
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:10.128
<v Maddog:>was specifically for UNIX at a much

753
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:12.032
<v Maddog:>lower price than you could buy a

754
00:34:12.312 --> 00:34:15.543
<v Maddog:>VAX computer system or something from Hewlett

755
00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:16.045
<v Maddog:>Packard.

756
00:34:17.268 --> 00:34:19.031
<v Maddog:>And they were looking for an operating

757
00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:20.074
<v Maddog:>system to put on it.

758
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.966
<v Maddog:>They had even come to Digital and

759
00:34:23.085 --> 00:34:25.752
<v Maddog:>asked to license VMS, but that wouldn't

760
00:34:25.812 --> 00:34:26.072
<v Maddog:>happen.

761
00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:31.005
<v Maddog:>And so they chose UNIX and specifically

762
00:34:31.025 --> 00:34:34.531
<v Maddog:>the Berkeley Software Distribution from the University

763
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:35.734
<v Maddog:>of California, Berkeley.

764
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.384
<v Maddog:>So originally, if you wanted UNIX on

765
00:34:40.425 --> 00:34:42.909
<v Maddog:>your system, you first had to buy

766
00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:45.233
<v Maddog:>a source code license from AT&T.

767
00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.125
<v Maddog:>And if you were not a university,

768
00:34:49.386 --> 00:34:51.431
<v Maddog:>that could be extremely expensive.

769
00:34:52.721 --> 00:34:55.806
<v Maddog:>And you had to supply AT&T the

770
00:34:55.907 --> 00:34:59.092
<v Maddog:>serial number of your computer system that

771
00:34:59.112 --> 00:35:00.154
<v Maddog:>you were going to put the source

772
00:35:00.194 --> 00:35:00.575
<v Maddog:>code on.

773
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:03.705
<v Maddog:>And if that system broke and you

774
00:35:03.746 --> 00:35:05.651
<v Maddog:>wanted to put another system, you had

775
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:08.022
<v Maddog:>to call up AT&T, give them the

776
00:35:08.122 --> 00:35:10.568
<v Maddog:>next serial number before you could move

777
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.272
<v Maddog:>the code to the next computer.

778
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.185
<v Maddog:>So this is very awkward, very difficult.

779
00:35:16.927 --> 00:35:21.214
<v Maddog:>Universities had a site-wide source code license.

780
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.243
<v Maddog:>And when I say universities, I'm talking

781
00:35:24.283 --> 00:35:28.970
<v Maddog:>about research universities like Stanford, like Berkeley,

782
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:31.995
<v Maddog:>like Caltech, like MIT.

783
00:35:33.421 --> 00:35:35.586
<v Maddog:>If you were Hartford State Technical College,

784
00:35:36.107 --> 00:35:38.714
<v Maddog:>you didn't get that type of license.

785
00:35:39.381 --> 00:35:40.906
<v Maddog:>You had to pay the huge amount

786
00:35:40.946 --> 00:35:41.307
<v Maddog:>of money.

787
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.846
<v Maddog:>So with Sun, they went back to

788
00:35:47.907 --> 00:35:50.451
<v Maddog:>AT&T and they said, "we're going to

789
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.716
<v Maddog:>distribute our code only in binary form.

790
00:35:54.701 --> 00:35:57.144
<v Maddog:>Does that make a difference?" And AT&T

791
00:35:57.204 --> 00:36:00.189
<v Maddog:>said, "yes, we will give you a

792
00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:02.252
<v Maddog:>much, much cheaper license.

793
00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:06.366
<v Maddog:>You know, you won't have to give

794
00:36:06.427 --> 00:36:07.371
<v Maddog:>us a serial number.

795
00:36:07.661 --> 00:36:09.867
<v Maddog:>You'll be able to manufacture this and

796
00:36:09.927 --> 00:36:11.711
<v Maddog:>put this out, you know, for a

797
00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:15.083
<v Maddog:>very low price." And this woke up

798
00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:18.188
<v Maddog:>all these other computer companies like DEC,

799
00:36:18.308 --> 00:36:20.212
<v Maddog:>like Hewlett Packard, like IBM and said,

800
00:36:20.412 --> 00:36:22.195
<v Maddog:>oh, we have to have the same

801
00:36:22.255 --> 00:36:22.455
<v Maddog:>deal.

802
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.803
<v Maddog:>We have to come out with our

803
00:36:24.943 --> 00:36:27.567
<v Maddog:>own version of Unix in binary only

804
00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:29.509
<v Maddog:>form so we can get the same

805
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:30.993
<v Maddog:>type of deal from AT&T.

806
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.366
<v Maddog:>And that is when Digital hired me

807
00:36:37.147 --> 00:36:38.710
<v Maddog:>as one of at that time, I

808
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.834
<v Maddog:>think there were only 16 people in

809
00:36:40.874 --> 00:36:42.036
<v Maddog:>the whole engineering group.

810
00:36:42.762 --> 00:36:44.506
<v Maddog:>We eventually grew to be over 500.

811
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.826
<v Maddog:>And, you know, to bring out this

812
00:36:48.926 --> 00:36:52.093
<v Maddog:>version, this binary only version of Unix.

813
00:36:53.741 --> 00:36:56.165
<v Maddog:>And this is important because as we

814
00:36:56.225 --> 00:36:57.567
<v Maddog:>get to Mr.

815
00:36:57.608 --> 00:37:00.091
<v Maddog:>Stallman in a little bit, we'll see

816
00:37:00.173 --> 00:37:01.255
<v Maddog:>why this affected him.

817
00:37:03.623 --> 00:37:04.965
<v Maddog:>I was in Digital.

818
00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:07.330
<v Maddog:>We brought out several different versions of

819
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:08.573
<v Maddog:>something we called V7M11.

820
00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:13.391
<v Maddog:>That was version 7M modified.

821
00:37:13.792 --> 00:37:14.493
<v Maddog:>We brought that out.

822
00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:17.095
<v Maddog:>We eventually changed that name to Ultrix

823
00:37:17.095 --> 00:37:17.341
<v Maddog:>11.

824
00:37:18.662 --> 00:37:20.528
<v Maddog:>We had another system, Ultrix 32 for

825
00:37:20.548 --> 00:37:20.948
<v Maddog:>the VAX.

826
00:37:23.224 --> 00:37:24.969
<v Maddog:>And that was going along.

827
00:37:27.082 --> 00:37:28.625
<v Maddog:>After a number of years, we came

828
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:32.553
<v Maddog:>out with this processor called the Alpha,

829
00:37:32.933 --> 00:37:33.995
<v Maddog:>the DEC Alpha.

830
00:37:35.042 --> 00:37:36.825
<v Maddog:>This was the this ended up being

831
00:37:36.865 --> 00:37:41.014
<v Maddog:>the fastest microprocessor in the world for

832
00:37:41.234 --> 00:37:41.775
<v Maddog:>eight years.

833
00:37:42.862 --> 00:37:45.888
<v Maddog:>It was also a 64 bit system

834
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:46.631
<v Maddog:>instead of 32 bit.

835
00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:49.447
<v Maddog:>Now, why is that important?

836
00:37:50.481 --> 00:37:53.006
<v Maddog:>It's important because with 32 bits, you

837
00:37:53.026 --> 00:37:55.993
<v Maddog:>can access four billion bytes of data.

838
00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.164
<v Maddog:>But with 64 bits, you can access

839
00:37:59.285 --> 00:38:02.953
<v Maddog:>four billion times four billion bytes of

840
00:38:03.013 --> 00:38:03.354
<v Maddog:>data.

841
00:38:04.661 --> 00:38:06.609
<v Maddog:>And that's enough to store about 32

842
00:38:07.124 --> 00:38:09.949
<v Maddog:>bytes of data for every square millimeter

843
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:12.813
<v Maddog:>on the surface of the earth, including

844
00:38:13.154 --> 00:38:13.935
<v Maddog:>all the oceans.

845
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.148
<v Maddog:>It is a huge amount of data.

846
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:21.244
<v Maddog:>And at the same time, we appointed

847
00:38:21.305 --> 00:38:25.852
<v Maddog:>this new operating system called OSF-1 that

848
00:38:25.892 --> 00:38:28.355
<v Maddog:>was developed by the Open Software Foundation

849
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:31.945
<v Maddog:>onto the Alpha to make a new

850
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:37.133
<v Maddog:>distribution of Unix for the Alpha computer.

851
00:38:38.562 --> 00:38:40.231
<v Maddog:>So we were starting to put this

852
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:40.492
<v Maddog:>out.

853
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:42.404
<v Maddog:>This, of course, was a closed source

854
00:38:42.464 --> 00:38:45.769
<v Maddog:>proprietary system that you still needed an

855
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.654
<v Maddog:>AT&T source code license to get.

856
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.267
<v Maddog:>You needed to, you know, it was

857
00:38:53.447 --> 00:38:54.951
<v Maddog:>it was very expensive to get the

858
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:55.853
<v Maddog:>source code for it.

859
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.363
<v Maddog:>And I was sitting there by this

860
00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:03.028
<v Maddog:>time being in technical marketing thinking, how

861
00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:08.075
<v Maddog:>can we make this code available to

862
00:39:08.175 --> 00:39:12.907
<v Maddog:>researchers, university researchers in how to use

863
00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.252
<v Maddog:>this very large address space?

864
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.763
<v Maddog:>Because in order for them to get

865
00:39:18.844 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Maddog:>the source code for OSF-1, they had

866
00:39:22.371 --> 00:39:23.614
<v Maddog:>to spend a lot of money.

867
00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.781
<v Maddog:>They had to.

868
00:39:25.623 --> 00:39:28.169
<v Maddog:>And then when they finished their research,

869
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.712
<v Maddog:>how did they publish it?

870
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.903
<v Maddog:>You know, all they can do is

871
00:39:31.943 --> 00:39:33.510
<v Maddog:>write white papers about it.

872
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.045
<v Maddog:>And, you know, so I was looking

873
00:39:37.165 --> 00:39:42.292
<v Maddog:>for a platform that university people could

874
00:39:42.454 --> 00:39:44.941
<v Maddog:>do the research and then publish not

875
00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:47.466
<v Maddog:>only their white papers, but also the

876
00:39:47.607 --> 00:39:49.691
<v Maddog:>source code for the work they had

877
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:53.363
<v Maddog:>done freely without having to worry about

878
00:39:53.464 --> 00:39:55.169
<v Maddog:>copyright or anything like that.

879
00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.743
<v Maddog:>And at the same time, I had

880
00:39:59.784 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Maddog:>a friend of mine who was looking

881
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.040
<v Maddog:>to bring this person from Europe to

882
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.327
<v Maddog:>a DECAS group in New Orleans, Louisiana,

883
00:40:11.988 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Maddog:>where we were going to have our

884
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.273
<v Maddog:>DECAS membership meeting.

885
00:40:15.273 --> 00:40:19.547
<v Maddog:>Now DECAS, I had been familiar with

886
00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:20.951
<v Maddog:>in the university.

887
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.961
<v Maddog:>I had gotten a lot of my

888
00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:25.926
<v Maddog:>software from DECAS because it was free

889
00:40:25.986 --> 00:40:29.009
<v Maddog:>software that you could just order from

890
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.754
<v Maddog:>my catalog for like five US dollars.

891
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.404
<v Maddog:>Remember, I told you about the one

892
00:40:34.464 --> 00:40:36.061
<v Maddog:>compiler that was $100,000?

893
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.345
<v Maddog:>I could get a compiler written by

894
00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:44.113
<v Maddog:>a DECAS member for five US dollars.

895
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.623
<v Maddog:>They basically pay for the cost of

896
00:40:46.643 --> 00:40:48.828
<v Maddog:>the paper tape to be sent through

897
00:40:48.848 --> 00:40:49.951
<v Maddog:>the postal mail to me.

898
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.283
<v Maddog:>I was exposed to DECAS at the

899
00:40:54.323 --> 00:40:57.588
<v Maddog:>university, exposed to DECAS at Harper State

900
00:40:57.648 --> 00:41:00.692
<v Maddog:>Technical College, out of my software for

901
00:41:00.713 --> 00:41:01.314
<v Maddog:>my students.

902
00:41:04.001 --> 00:41:05.903
<v Maddog:>I was exposed to DECAS at Bell

903
00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:08.687
<v Maddog:>Labs because even though we were using

904
00:41:08.847 --> 00:41:11.851
<v Maddog:>AT&T's UNIX system, we were using it

905
00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:14.586
<v Maddog:>on DeX hardware, the VAX 11780.

906
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.123
<v Maddog:>So I was exposed to DECAS this

907
00:41:20.183 --> 00:41:23.407
<v Maddog:>whole time, which were users of digital

908
00:41:23.467 --> 00:41:27.151
<v Maddog:>equipment who wrote software and contributed it

909
00:41:27.512 --> 00:41:30.294
<v Maddog:>to the DECAS library so that other

910
00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:31.937
<v Maddog:>people could be helped by it.

911
00:41:33.905 --> 00:41:35.891
<v Maddog:>And so I was going to this

912
00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:36.673
<v Maddog:>DECAS meeting.

913
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.767
<v Maddog:>There were 19,000 people going to be

914
00:41:39.808 --> 00:41:40.590
<v Maddog:>coming to the meeting.

915
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.145
<v Maddog:>I said, OK, I will finance this

916
00:41:46.205 --> 00:41:49.769
<v Maddog:>young person from Europe to come to

917
00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:52.553
<v Maddog:>DECAS to talk about the software that

918
00:41:52.573 --> 00:41:54.115
<v Maddog:>he wrote, whatever it is.

919
00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.742
<v Maddog:>And when I arrived at DECAS in

920
00:41:57.802 --> 00:42:00.206
<v Maddog:>New Orleans, I saw Linux for the

921
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:02.569
<v Maddog:>first time because this young person was

922
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.095
<v Maddog:>Linus Torvalds, who I'd never heard of

923
00:42:06.115 --> 00:42:06.676
<v Maddog:>before.

924
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.886
<v Maddog:>I'd never heard of Linux before.

925
00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.929
<v Maddog:>They invited me to use Linux.

926
00:42:12.823 --> 00:42:15.012
<v Maddog:>And I said, this is really good.

927
00:42:15.823 --> 00:42:17.429
<v Maddog:>And this was on an Intel system.

928
00:42:18.783 --> 00:42:19.847
<v Maddog:>This is really good.

929
00:42:21.361 --> 00:42:23.130
<v Maddog:>And I listened to Linus' talks.

930
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.885
<v Maddog:>Only 40 people showed up to each

931
00:42:25.965 --> 00:42:28.915
<v Maddog:>talk, which today it would be 6,000

932
00:42:29.331 --> 00:42:31.013
<v Maddog:>people who would show up to hear

933
00:42:31.074 --> 00:42:31.435
<v Maddog:>him talk.

934
00:42:32.561 --> 00:42:34.206
<v Maddog:>But only 40 people out of 19,000

935
00:42:34.206 --> 00:42:34.446
<v Maddog:>showed up.

936
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:39.205
<v Maddog:>And after he gave his talk, I

937
00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:41.290
<v Maddog:>took him out on this riverboat called

938
00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.072
<v Maddog:>the Natchez.

939
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.923
<v Maddog:>And while on board the Natchez, I

940
00:42:46.003 --> 00:42:48.566
<v Maddog:>said to him, "Linus, have you ever

941
00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:52.911
<v Maddog:>thought about making Linux 64-bit and putting

942
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:55.894
<v Maddog:>it on a RISC processor instead of

943
00:42:55.954 --> 00:42:59.763
<v Maddog:>an Intel CISC processor?" And he said,

944
00:42:59.763 --> 00:43:01.590
<v Maddog:>"well, I'd like to do that.

945
00:43:02.441 --> 00:43:04.745
<v Maddog:>But the DEC office in Helsinki, Finland

946
00:43:04.907 --> 00:43:06.790
<v Maddog:>has been having problems getting me an

947
00:43:06.952 --> 00:43:07.233
<v Maddog:>alpha.

948
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.103
<v Maddog:>So I may have to do an

949
00:43:09.564 --> 00:43:14.946
<v Maddog:>IBM PowerPC instead." Now, I knew this

950
00:43:14.966 --> 00:43:15.948
<v Maddog:>was a wrong answer.

951
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:19.286
<v Maddog:>I knew the alpha system was really

952
00:43:19.346 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Maddog:>the one he wanted to do.

953
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.546
<v Maddog:>And so I said, don't do anything

954
00:43:23.706 --> 00:43:24.028
<v Maddog:>rash.

955
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.886
<v Maddog:>I went back to digital headquarters and

956
00:43:27.926 --> 00:43:29.149
<v Maddog:>I called up a friend of mine

957
00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:30.211
<v Maddog:>named Jim Jackson.

958
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.106
<v Maddog:>Now, for your audience, people would tell

959
00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:36.629
<v Maddog:>you that the way you get things

960
00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:38.833
<v Maddog:>done in a big company is that

961
00:43:38.873 --> 00:43:40.015
<v Maddog:>you write a proposal.

962
00:43:40.462 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Maddog:>You send it to your management.

963
00:43:42.422 --> 00:43:43.228
<v Maddog:>They look at it.

964
00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:45.130
<v Maddog:>They send it to their management.

965
00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:46.208
<v Maddog:>It goes up.

966
00:43:46.803 --> 00:43:47.546
<v Maddog:>This could take work.

967
00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:51.247
<v Maddog:>And so I did the thing that

968
00:43:51.287 --> 00:43:52.712
<v Maddog:>you really get stuff done.

969
00:43:53.321 --> 00:43:54.625
<v Maddog:>I called in favors.

970
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.785
<v Maddog:>And I'd been working at digital at

971
00:43:57.826 --> 00:43:58.749
<v Maddog:>that point for 11 years.

972
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.404
<v Maddog:>And there were a lot of people

973
00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.170
<v Maddog:>who owed me favors.

974
00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.469
<v Maddog:>And Jim Jackson was one of them.

975
00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:08.748
<v Maddog:>And I said, hi, Jim.

976
00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:10.648
<v Maddog:>You don't know who this person is.

977
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.145
<v Maddog:>You don't know what he did.

978
00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:15.325
<v Maddog:>But I need to have an alpha

979
00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:17.992
<v Maddog:>system sent to Helsinki, Finland right away.

980
00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:20.447
<v Maddog:>He said, you're in luck.

981
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.344
<v Maddog:>I have one sitting beside my desk

982
00:44:23.404 --> 00:44:26.890
<v Maddog:>that was returned from a software developer.

983
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.085
<v Maddog:>To make a long story short, that

984
00:44:31.165 --> 00:44:32.328
<v Maddog:>system was worth 30,000 U.S.

985
00:44:32.348 --> 00:44:32.528
<v Maddog:>dollars.

986
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:37.604
<v Maddog:>And Jim Jackson sent it to this

987
00:44:37.664 --> 00:44:39.707
<v Maddog:>person he never heard of with no

988
00:44:39.787 --> 00:44:43.933
<v Maddog:>justification whatsoever other than Mad Dog said

989
00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:44.453
<v Maddog:>it should go.

990
00:44:46.421 --> 00:44:48.710
<v Maddog:>And Jim says, "what are you going

991
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.024
<v Maddog:>to pay for?" I said, "I'll pay

992
00:44:50.044 --> 00:44:53.883
<v Maddog:>for the shipping." And that showed up

993
00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:57.190
<v Maddog:>in Linus' doorstep one day before the

994
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.432
<v Maddog:>IBM PowerPC.

995
00:45:00.922 --> 00:45:02.946
<v Maddog:>But by that time, Linus had made

996
00:45:03.026 --> 00:45:04.991
<v Maddog:>up his mind that the alpha was

997
00:45:05.031 --> 00:45:06.694
<v Maddog:>the one he really wanted to do.

998
00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.608
<v Maddog:>And so when the IBM PowerPC showed

999
00:45:10.728 --> 00:45:13.534
<v Maddog:>up, he basically never even turned it

1000
00:45:13.674 --> 00:45:13.734
<v Maddog:>on.

1001
00:45:15.043 --> 00:45:16.227
<v Maddog:>And he didn't turn it on for

1002
00:45:16.367 --> 00:45:16.729
<v Maddog:>over a year.

1003
00:45:18.561 --> 00:45:20.085
<v Maddog:>Finally, he did turn it on just

1004
00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:21.368
<v Maddog:>so he could tell IBM he had

1005
00:45:21.408 --> 00:45:21.889
<v Maddog:>turned it on.

1006
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.283
<v Maddog:>But I then gathered some people at

1007
00:45:26.644 --> 00:45:30.470
<v Maddog:>Digital who were also interested in having

1008
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.095
<v Maddog:>this research project done for the alpha.

1009
00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:36.065
<v Maddog:>And they helped out with some of

1010
00:45:36.165 --> 00:45:38.531
<v Maddog:>the low-level engineering that had to be

1011
00:45:38.571 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Maddog:>done.

1012
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.323
<v Maddog:>While Linus and the rest of the

1013
00:45:42.363 --> 00:45:45.629
<v Maddog:>kernel developers worked on the higher-level parts

1014
00:45:45.689 --> 00:45:48.834
<v Maddog:>of the kernel, getting that working on

1015
00:45:48.854 --> 00:45:49.335
<v Maddog:>the system.

1016
00:45:50.824 --> 00:45:52.010
<v Maddog:>And we finished the port.

1017
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.884
<v Maddog:>We started the port in earnest on

1018
00:45:53.964 --> 00:45:55.613
<v Maddog:>January the 1st of 1995.

1019
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.125
<v Maddog:>And we finished the port in November

1020
00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:03.389
<v Maddog:>with the release of Red Hat software

1021
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:05.518
<v Maddog:>in November of 1995.

1022
00:46:05.518 --> 00:46:10.104
<v Maddog:>So 11 months to take Linux from

1023
00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:14.671
<v Maddog:>being a 32-bit kernel only on Intel

1024
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:17.736
<v Maddog:>systems to being a big kernel.

1025
00:46:18.922 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Maddog:>And on N architectures, not just two.

1026
00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:26.164
<v Maddog:>So in other words, if you wanted

1027
00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:28.086
<v Maddog:>to add PowerPC, if you wanted to

1028
00:46:28.287 --> 00:46:31.691
<v Maddog:>add Motorola, Linus set up the Swoyskio

1029
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:34.515
<v Maddog:>tree to cover all of those architectures.

1030
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.248
<v Maddog:>So this was a major step in

1031
00:46:38.269 --> 00:46:39.092
<v Maddog:>the Linux kernel.

1032
00:46:39.981 --> 00:46:41.323
<v Maddog:>And it's one of the reasons why

1033
00:46:41.403 --> 00:46:43.746
<v Maddog:>the Linux kernel is used as part

1034
00:46:43.766 --> 00:46:46.831
<v Maddog:>of Android as well as GNU Linux.

1035
00:46:51.924 --> 00:46:53.090
<v Maddog:>Go ahead.

1036
00:46:53.261 --> 00:46:53.410
<v Elisabetta Mori:>No, no..

1037
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:53.663
<v Elisabetta Mori:>go ahead.

1038
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:58.047
<v Maddog:>So this is how I got this

1039
00:46:58.107 --> 00:47:00.052
<v Maddog:>is why I got interested in Linux.

1040
00:47:01.461 --> 00:47:04.488
<v Maddog:>And I could see because by this

1041
00:47:04.528 --> 00:47:06.131
<v Maddog:>time I'd been in the computer industry

1042
00:47:06.192 --> 00:47:06.894
<v Maddog:>a long time.

1043
00:47:07.862 --> 00:47:10.107
<v Maddog:>And I could see the rate at

1044
00:47:10.148 --> 00:47:11.491
<v Maddog:>which Linux was growing.

1045
00:47:12.861 --> 00:47:15.668
<v Maddog:>And I could see that Unix systems

1046
00:47:15.868 --> 00:47:18.354
<v Maddog:>were really losing out to Windows NT.

1047
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:22.265
<v Maddog:>Because by this time, Microsoft was not

1048
00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:26.452
<v Maddog:>only being satisfied with the desktop, they

1049
00:47:26.492 --> 00:47:28.375
<v Maddog:>wanted server systems also.

1050
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.383
<v Maddog:>And while Unix systems were still the

1051
00:47:31.503 --> 00:47:34.427
<v Maddog:>king of a server system environment, along

1052
00:47:34.447 --> 00:47:38.452
<v Maddog:>with proprietary operating systems like MVS, VMS,

1053
00:47:39.413 --> 00:47:41.116
<v Maddog:>and MFT and others.

1054
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.086
<v Maddog:>The you know, you could see that

1055
00:47:45.146 --> 00:47:48.232
<v Maddog:>Windows NT was beginning to encroach on

1056
00:47:48.293 --> 00:47:48.494
<v Maddog:>that.

1057
00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.002
<v Maddog:>Or Riley, who had been, you know,

1058
00:47:52.063 --> 00:47:55.888
<v Maddog:>spent years publishing books on Unix and

1059
00:47:55.988 --> 00:47:59.232
<v Maddog:>books on Unix applications was now switching

1060
00:47:59.492 --> 00:48:03.015
<v Maddog:>over to publishing books on Windows NT.

1061
00:48:04.761 --> 00:48:06.345
<v Maddog:>And I don't blame Tim for doing

1062
00:48:06.385 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Maddog:>that because he had a publishing house,

1063
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:10.413
<v Maddog:>he had people he employed and stuff.

1064
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.143
<v Maddog:>But I felt a little bit betrayed

1065
00:48:13.804 --> 00:48:16.067
<v Maddog:>by the person who had been pushing

1066
00:48:16.087 --> 00:48:18.952
<v Maddog:>these Unix books for years, and was

1067
00:48:19.032 --> 00:48:21.234
<v Maddog:>now falling into the Microsoft camp.

1068
00:48:22.622 --> 00:48:25.471
<v Maddog:>But as Linux came out, he switched

1069
00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:25.772
<v Maddog:>back.

1070
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.125
<v Maddog:>He stopped publishing books on Windows NT

1071
00:48:29.465 --> 00:48:31.949
<v Maddog:>and went back to repurposing his books

1072
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.754
<v Maddog:>on Unix to this new thing called

1073
00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:35.095
<v Maddog:>Linux.

1074
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.743
<v Maddog:>And of course, he started up the

1075
00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:41.550
<v Maddog:>conference, the open source conference every year,

1076
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.573
<v Maddog:>and he's been active in the open

1077
00:48:43.593 --> 00:48:44.234
<v Maddog:>source work.

1078
00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:48.426
<v Maddog:>But I find it interesting that he

1079
00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:51.252
<v Maddog:>did make that switch, you know, in

1080
00:48:51.273 --> 00:48:51.613
<v Maddog:>the midst.

1081
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:56.629
<v Maddog:>And I knew that Linux was going

1082
00:48:56.669 --> 00:48:59.575
<v Maddog:>to reinvigorate the Unix marketplace.

1083
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Maddog:>It was going to supply Unix like

1084
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:08.274
<v Maddog:>systems in all spaces.

1085
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:13.209
<v Maddog:>And today, Linux is the most used

1086
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:15.494
<v Maddog:>operating system in the world.

1087
00:49:16.761 --> 00:49:20.627
<v Maddog:>If you combine Android, if you say

1088
00:49:20.989 --> 00:49:23.273
<v Maddog:>all the embedded systems that are being

1089
00:49:23.313 --> 00:49:26.162
<v Maddog:>produced that use Linux, if you say

1090
00:49:26.483 --> 00:49:29.249
<v Maddog:>all the service systems that are Linux

1091
00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Maddog:>server systems, particularly in the cloud, if

1092
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.484
<v Maddog:>you say that all 500 of the

1093
00:49:35.584 --> 00:49:39.269
<v Maddog:>fastest supercomputers in the world use Linux,

1094
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.854
<v Maddog:>Linux is the most used kernel in

1095
00:49:43.894 --> 00:49:44.274
<v Maddog:>the world.

1096
00:49:46.381 --> 00:49:49.249
<v Maddog:>And, you know, that I was very

1097
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:50.091
<v Maddog:>happy about that.

1098
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.765
<v Maddog:>And I'm very happy about the fact

1099
00:49:52.825 --> 00:49:55.471
<v Maddog:>that Linux is not only open source

1100
00:49:55.492 --> 00:50:00.025
<v Maddog:>software, but is free software that uses

1101
00:50:00.085 --> 00:50:02.469
<v Maddog:>a GPL license, not one of the

1102
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:04.031
<v Maddog:>other open source licenses.

1103
00:50:09.482 --> 00:50:13.629
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you describe Linus Torvalds and your

1104
00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:14.549
<v Elisabetta Mori:>relationship with him?

1105
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:21.205
<v Maddog:>It is a strange relationship because I

1106
00:50:22.428 --> 00:50:24.591
<v Maddog:>knew Linus, you know, first as this

1107
00:50:24.692 --> 00:50:26.936
<v Maddog:>university student who had this project.

1108
00:50:27.963 --> 00:50:30.571
<v Maddog:>I was amazed by the project, quite

1109
00:50:30.612 --> 00:50:31.013
<v Maddog:>frankly.

1110
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.768
<v Maddog:>Now, I've seen other open source projects

1111
00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:38.481
<v Maddog:>like the X-Windows system from MIT, like

1112
00:50:38.521 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Maddog:>the Berkeley software distribution of BSD Unix.

1113
00:50:45.062 --> 00:50:46.786
<v Maddog:>I've seen those, but those were all

1114
00:50:46.926 --> 00:50:50.594
<v Maddog:>places that had a central focal point.

1115
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.685
<v Maddog:>You know, the X-Windows system had the

1116
00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:56.410
<v Maddog:>X consortium that came out of Boston

1117
00:50:56.591 --> 00:50:58.555
<v Maddog:>or came out of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

1118
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:01.527
<v Maddog:>And Berkeley, of course, had the University

1119
00:51:01.547 --> 00:51:02.609
<v Maddog:>of California Berkeley.

1120
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.806
<v Maddog:>Linux was a thing that the center

1121
00:51:07.986 --> 00:51:11.592
<v Maddog:>of the Linux project was Linus's bedroom

1122
00:51:12.454 --> 00:51:13.535
<v Maddog:>in Helsinki, Finland.

1123
00:51:14.561 --> 00:51:16.082
<v Maddog:>And it was being developed by these

1124
00:51:16.163 --> 00:51:18.067
<v Maddog:>people who were scattered across the world

1125
00:51:18.107 --> 00:51:20.091
<v Maddog:>that many of them had never met

1126
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:21.213
<v Maddog:>each other face to face.

1127
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.386
<v Maddog:>And over the years, I started to

1128
00:51:25.446 --> 00:51:27.171
<v Maddog:>think more about this and why this

1129
00:51:27.232 --> 00:51:28.515
<v Maddog:>happened at this time.

1130
00:51:28.582 --> 00:51:30.269
<v Maddog:>And I came up with three major

1131
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.610
<v Maddog:>things.

1132
00:51:31.741 --> 00:51:35.426
<v Maddog:>Number one, Linus first started the project

1133
00:51:35.587 --> 00:51:37.180
<v Maddog:>because he had a brand new 386

1134
00:51:38.231 --> 00:51:41.856
<v Maddog:>processor that he had gotten for Christmas.

1135
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:44.106
<v Maddog:>And, of course, the operating system that

1136
00:51:44.146 --> 00:51:46.071
<v Maddog:>came with it was Microsoft.

1137
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.708
<v Maddog:>And Microsoft at the time used a

1138
00:51:50.808 --> 00:51:54.480
<v Maddog:>swapping type of memory system, which meant

1139
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.844
<v Maddog:>that the largest program you could possibly

1140
00:51:56.904 --> 00:52:01.652
<v Maddog:>have in your Microsoft system was how

1141
00:52:01.692 --> 00:52:03.234
<v Maddog:>much you had.

1142
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.183
<v Maddog:>And your whole program had to fit

1143
00:52:06.224 --> 00:52:09.388
<v Maddog:>into that RAM, possibly extended a little

1144
00:52:09.429 --> 00:52:10.952
<v Maddog:>bit by what we call overlays.

1145
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.464
<v Maddog:>But that was a limitation.

1146
00:52:14.484 --> 00:52:17.232
<v Maddog:>That was the operating system, not the

1147
00:52:17.272 --> 00:52:17.732
<v Maddog:>hardware.

1148
00:52:17.733 --> 00:52:21.488
<v Maddog:>The 386 could support what we call

1149
00:52:21.528 --> 00:52:25.222
<v Maddog:>demand page virtual memory, which will allow

1150
00:52:25.262 --> 00:52:27.728
<v Maddog:>you to have a program as big

1151
00:52:28.269 --> 00:52:29.973
<v Maddog:>as a disk drive that backed it

1152
00:52:30.073 --> 00:52:30.153
<v Maddog:>up.

1153
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:35.068
<v Maddog:>And so this was a real limitation

1154
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.134
<v Maddog:>on the Microsoft operating system of the

1155
00:52:38.194 --> 00:52:38.433
<v Maddog:>time.

1156
00:52:39.862 --> 00:52:42.428
<v Maddog:>The second thing was that the Internet

1157
00:52:42.689 --> 00:52:44.614
<v Maddog:>was actually coming into your home.

1158
00:52:45.982 --> 00:52:49.631
<v Maddog:>The Internet existed in universities, existed in

1159
00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:50.273
<v Maddog:>companies.

1160
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.646
<v Maddog:>But in 1994, you could actually get

1161
00:52:54.706 --> 00:52:58.873
<v Maddog:>the Internet through DSL or through beings

1162
00:52:59.774 --> 00:53:00.515
<v Maddog:>in your house.

1163
00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:03.344
<v Maddog:>And therefore, people could work on this

1164
00:53:03.444 --> 00:53:06.531
<v Maddog:>project, not at their office, not at

1165
00:53:06.551 --> 00:53:08.394
<v Maddog:>the university, but in their homes.

1166
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:11.604
<v Maddog:>And the third thing was that there

1167
00:53:11.644 --> 00:53:14.689
<v Maddog:>was already existing a wide range of

1168
00:53:14.769 --> 00:53:17.934
<v Maddog:>documentation about how operating systems were supposed

1169
00:53:17.974 --> 00:53:18.294
<v Maddog:>to work.

1170
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.805
<v Maddog:>There were things like Minix, which was

1171
00:53:21.825 --> 00:53:25.692
<v Maddog:>a microkernel that that leaders did for

1172
00:53:25.812 --> 00:53:27.255
<v Maddog:>one reason or another didn't choose.

1173
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.087
<v Maddog:>There were there was BSD that you

1174
00:53:31.209 --> 00:53:32.573
<v Maddog:>could get the source code for.

1175
00:53:33.741 --> 00:53:35.105
<v Maddog:>But, you know, that was tied up

1176
00:53:35.225 --> 00:53:37.451
<v Maddog:>with some type of legal things from

1177
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:37.531
<v Maddog:>AT&T.

1178
00:53:40.042 --> 00:53:43.949
<v Maddog:>And so all these things came together,

1179
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.875
<v Maddog:>the documentation, the Internet in the home,

1180
00:53:47.861 --> 00:53:50.600
<v Maddog:>and the availability of this very powerful

1181
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:55.295
<v Maddog:>386 processor that could have demand page

1182
00:53:55.355 --> 00:53:56.196
<v Maddog:>virtual memory.

1183
00:53:57.041 --> 00:53:59.484
<v Maddog:>And then finally, this very stubborn young

1184
00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:03.531
<v Maddog:>man in Helsinki, Finland, who was going

1185
00:54:03.551 --> 00:54:06.035
<v Maddog:>to write his own kernel just for

1186
00:54:06.115 --> 00:54:06.274
<v Maddog:>fun.

1187
00:54:07.421 --> 00:54:08.604
<v Maddog:>It wasn't going to be a big

1188
00:54:08.824 --> 00:54:09.926
<v Maddog:>important project.

1189
00:54:10.709 --> 00:54:11.832
<v Maddog:>It was just going to be his

1190
00:54:11.872 --> 00:54:12.473
<v Maddog:>little hobby.

1191
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.725
<v Maddog:>Does anybody want to join him with

1192
00:54:14.826 --> 00:54:15.969
<v Maddog:>us with this?

1193
00:54:17.661 --> 00:54:20.167
<v Maddog:>And so I met him.

1194
00:54:20.868 --> 00:54:22.375
<v Maddog:>So he started the project in 1991.

1195
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.144
<v Maddog:>Version one of the kernel had come

1196
00:54:26.244 --> 00:54:28.288
<v Maddog:>out just a month or so before

1197
00:54:28.408 --> 00:54:30.072
<v Maddog:>I met him at this event.

1198
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.842
<v Maddog:>And if you if you work with

1199
00:54:33.942 --> 00:54:37.126
<v Maddog:>operating system development, you realize that version

1200
00:54:37.426 --> 00:54:40.750
<v Maddog:>one is the first version that people

1201
00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:44.816
<v Maddog:>say, OK, we can really have people

1202
00:54:44.996 --> 00:54:45.455
<v Maddog:>using this.

1203
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.966
<v Maddog:>It has enough functionality that is useful

1204
00:54:47.986 --> 00:54:49.210
<v Maddog:>to the average person.

1205
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.307
<v Maddog:>Before that, you have version zero point

1206
00:54:53.487 --> 00:54:55.652
<v Maddog:>one, version zero point two, version zero

1207
00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:56.153
<v Maddog:>point three.

1208
00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.343
<v Maddog:>And for the previous year, Linux had

1209
00:54:59.363 --> 00:55:01.786
<v Maddog:>been on version point nine nine nine

1210
00:55:01.846 --> 00:55:04.509
<v Maddog:>nine point nine nine nine nine nine

1211
00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:06.732
<v Maddog:>nine nine and point nine nine nine

1212
00:55:06.773 --> 00:55:07.875
<v Maddog:>nine nine nine nine.

1213
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.726
<v Maddog:>Until finally, in the first few months

1214
00:55:11.726 --> 00:55:12.869
<v Maddog:>of 1994, it became version one.

1215
00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:20.643
<v Maddog:>In the meantime, in 1993, there were

1216
00:55:20.663 --> 00:55:24.106
<v Maddog:>these other groups of people like Yggdrasil,

1217
00:55:24.706 --> 00:55:29.690
<v Maddog:>soft landing systems, a fledgling red hat

1218
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.932
<v Maddog:>and others who were taking the kernel

1219
00:55:33.272 --> 00:55:35.674
<v Maddog:>and all the new tools and some

1220
00:55:35.694 --> 00:55:37.935
<v Maddog:>of the things from BSD and putting

1221
00:55:37.975 --> 00:55:40.377
<v Maddog:>them together into distributions.

1222
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.111
<v Maddog:>So their distributions were either Debian was

1223
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:47.114
<v Maddog:>already also there.

1224
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:50.706
<v Maddog:>The distributions were already shipping or very

1225
00:55:50.786 --> 00:55:54.252
<v Maddog:>close to shipping when Linus said, OK,

1226
00:55:54.293 --> 00:55:55.355
<v Maddog:>it's one dot oh.

1227
00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.404
<v Maddog:>And so they put the one dot

1228
00:55:57.425 --> 00:55:59.313
<v Maddog:>oh kernel into their distributions.

1229
00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.769
<v Maddog:>And that's when Linux hit the big

1230
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:02.110
<v Maddog:>time.

1231
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.225
<v Maddog:>OK, so I'm seeing it because Linux

1232
00:56:07.426 --> 00:56:08.848
<v Maddog:>with version one dot oh of the

1233
00:56:08.909 --> 00:56:12.714
<v Maddog:>kernel on top of this Intel system

1234
00:56:13.195 --> 00:56:13.636
<v Maddog:>that was 32 bit.

1235
00:56:14.721 --> 00:56:16.423
<v Maddog:>And I'm saying, I want to see

1236
00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:19.527
<v Maddog:>this when an alpha 64 bit system

1237
00:56:20.409 --> 00:56:24.094
<v Maddog:>with the fastest microprocessor in the world.

1238
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.383
<v Maddog:>And so I met Linus.

1239
00:56:29.025 --> 00:56:33.672
<v Maddog:>He's a very quiet, you know, introspective

1240
00:56:34.554 --> 00:56:35.335
<v Maddog:>type of person.

1241
00:56:36.581 --> 00:56:39.827
<v Maddog:>And I liked him immediately, not just

1242
00:56:39.887 --> 00:56:42.252
<v Maddog:>because he had done Linux, but because

1243
00:56:42.533 --> 00:56:43.014
<v Maddog:>I liked him.

1244
00:56:44.462 --> 00:56:45.145
<v Maddog:>And he liked me.

1245
00:56:46.401 --> 00:56:48.508
<v Maddog:>And we went out on this riverboat

1246
00:56:48.548 --> 00:56:49.270
<v Maddog:>I talked about.

1247
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.704
<v Maddog:>I took it and showed him the

1248
00:56:51.744 --> 00:56:54.731
<v Maddog:>steam engine at the part of at

1249
00:56:54.751 --> 00:56:55.553
<v Maddog:>the back of the boat.

1250
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.187
<v Maddog:>I didn't know at that time that

1251
00:56:58.227 --> 00:56:59.672
<v Maddog:>he loved steam engines.

1252
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:03.027
<v Maddog:>He is a math physics major and

1253
00:57:03.047 --> 00:57:05.393
<v Maddog:>he loved the whole concept of steam

1254
00:57:05.493 --> 00:57:05.814
<v Maddog:>engines.

1255
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:08.265
<v Maddog:>So here I am explaining the steam

1256
00:57:08.365 --> 00:57:09.728
<v Maddog:>engine to him and how it works,

1257
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:11.812
<v Maddog:>because I love steam engines.

1258
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.849
<v Maddog:>I also like mechanical clocks.

1259
00:57:15.702 --> 00:57:17.226
<v Maddog:>I didn't realize at the time that

1260
00:57:17.306 --> 00:57:18.690
<v Maddog:>he likes mechanical clocks.

1261
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.082
<v Maddog:>I like warm puppies.

1262
00:57:22.267 --> 00:57:23.331
<v Maddog:>He loves warm puppies.

1263
00:57:24.861 --> 00:57:27.527
<v Maddog:>And eventually I met his wife, Tuve,

1264
00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:29.933
<v Maddog:>who prefers to be called Susan these

1265
00:57:29.993 --> 00:57:30.232
<v Maddog:>days.

1266
00:57:31.561 --> 00:57:34.887
<v Maddog:>And so eventually one day they called

1267
00:57:34.927 --> 00:57:37.152
<v Maddog:>me up and they said, "Maddog, we're

1268
00:57:37.192 --> 00:57:39.455
<v Maddog:>about to have a child.

1269
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:40.324
<v Maddog:>Would Would you like to be one

1270
00:57:40.364 --> 00:57:45.545
<v Maddog:>of the godfathers?" So each finished person,

1271
00:57:45.665 --> 00:57:48.211
<v Maddog:>each finished child has two godfathers and

1272
00:57:48.271 --> 00:57:49.093
<v Maddog:>two godmothers.

1273
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.527
<v Maddog:>And Linus and Tuve would be to

1274
00:57:52.567 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Maddog:>be one of the godfathers.

1275
00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.329
<v Maddog:>Dirk Hondo is the other godfather.

1276
00:57:58.522 --> 00:57:59.705
<v Maddog:>And then two godmothers.

1277
00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.145
<v Maddog:>And I accepted and I went over

1278
00:58:04.225 --> 00:58:06.590
<v Maddog:>for the baby naming ceremony, which was

1279
00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:08.774
<v Maddog:>about six months after Patricia was born.

1280
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.187
<v Maddog:>And I met all their family and

1281
00:58:12.247 --> 00:58:12.508
<v Maddog:>stuff.

1282
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.087
<v Maddog:>So, you know, this is not about

1283
00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:20.853
<v Maddog:>Linux or about computers.

1284
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.226
<v Maddog:>It's about I like them and they

1285
00:58:24.266 --> 00:58:24.988
<v Maddog:>seem to like me.

1286
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.665
<v Maddog:>And I some from time to time

1287
00:58:28.765 --> 00:58:30.009
<v Maddog:>visit them in the house.

1288
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.584
<v Maddog:>And people say to me, oh, Mad

1289
00:58:32.624 --> 00:58:33.908
<v Maddog:>Dog, you must talk to Linus a

1290
00:58:33.968 --> 00:58:34.891
<v Maddog:>lot about Linux.

1291
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.864
<v Maddog:>I say, no, I don't.

1292
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.944
<v Maddog:>There was enough people who give him

1293
00:58:39.985 --> 00:58:42.212
<v Maddog:>advice and knowledge stuff on Linux.

1294
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.144
<v Maddog:>I talked to him about his family

1295
00:58:46.387 --> 00:58:48.492
<v Maddog:>and his interests other than Linux.

1296
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.343
<v Maddog:>And I think that's why they also

1297
00:58:51.383 --> 00:58:52.345
<v Maddog:>continue to like me.

1298
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.009
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So let's go back to 1994.

1299
00:59:00.661 --> 00:59:02.928
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So in 1994, you began your experience

1300
00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:04.252
<v Elisabetta Mori:>with Linux International.

1301
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.283
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So can you explain to us what

1302
00:59:07.464 --> 00:59:09.989
<v Elisabetta Mori:>is Linux International and what are your

1303
00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:12.493
<v Elisabetta Mori:>major contributions to these so far?

1304
00:59:13.761 --> 00:59:17.687
<v Maddog:>OK, so in 1990, there was a

1305
00:59:17.747 --> 00:59:21.772
<v Maddog:>group of small companies who said Linux

1306
00:59:22.053 --> 00:59:24.803
<v Maddog:>is looked at by hobbyists and some

1307
00:59:24.843 --> 00:59:26.730
<v Maddog:>people in the scientific community.

1308
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:29.588
<v Maddog:>But we really think that it has

1309
00:59:29.729 --> 00:59:30.812
<v Maddog:>commercial value.

1310
00:59:32.182 --> 00:59:34.267
<v Maddog:>And these companies were people like the

1311
00:59:34.307 --> 00:59:37.454
<v Maddog:>original Linux mall by Mark Bolstern.

1312
00:59:38.761 --> 00:59:40.944
<v Maddog:>Bill Hughes, who started the Linux Journal,

1313
00:59:40.964 --> 00:59:45.592
<v Maddog:>a very, very young Red Hat that

1314
00:59:45.612 --> 00:59:49.302
<v Maddog:>was started by Mark Ewing, Eric Trowen

1315
00:59:49.663 --> 00:59:52.047
<v Maddog:>and Donnie Barnes, and then later joined

1316
00:59:52.127 --> 00:59:54.992
<v Maddog:>by Bob Young, who became the president

1317
00:59:55.533 --> 00:59:56.435
<v Maddog:>of Red Hat.

1318
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:02.469
<v Maddog:>We had people from Yggdrasil, eventually even

1319
01:00:02.509 --> 01:00:05.714
<v Maddog:>Sun Microsystems joined and Digital joined.

1320
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.685
<v Maddog:>But because these companies were very small,

1321
01:00:09.765 --> 01:00:11.968
<v Maddog:>they didn't have much money to help

1322
01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:14.294
<v Maddog:>to fund Linux International.

1323
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.022
<v Maddog:>And when I went to my boss

1324
01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:19.326
<v Maddog:>and said we can know digital can

1325
01:00:19.386 --> 01:00:23.152
<v Maddog:>join Linux International at the highest membership

1326
01:00:23.212 --> 01:00:25.502
<v Maddog:>rate, he said, "what is that rate?"

1327
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.924
<v Maddog:>I said, "four thousand dollars." He said,

1328
01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.028
<v Maddog:>"I don't think I can write a

1329
01:00:30.108 --> 01:00:32.111
<v Maddog:>check for that small amount of money."

1330
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.863
<v Maddog:>But he did.

1331
01:00:34.883 --> 01:00:35.846
<v Maddog:>And we joined.

1332
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:42.889
<v Maddog:>And this was, you know, we started

1333
01:00:42.929 --> 01:00:45.253
<v Maddog:>it up and almost immediately we were

1334
01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:46.214
<v Maddog:>hit with a problem.

1335
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.342
<v Maddog:>There was this person in Boston, Massachusetts,

1336
01:00:49.382 --> 01:00:52.486
<v Maddog:>who had trademarked the term Linux and

1337
01:00:52.526 --> 01:00:55.671
<v Maddog:>was contacting all these companies saying, "unless

1338
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:58.834
<v Maddog:>you pay me a quarter of your

1339
01:00:58.994 --> 01:01:02.083
<v Maddog:>revenues, I'm going to sue you and

1340
01:01:02.123 --> 01:01:04.029
<v Maddog:>block you from using the word Linux."

1341
01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.086
<v Maddog:>Now, anybody who does licensing of trademarks

1342
01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:12.211
<v Maddog:>or technology of any type knows that

1343
01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:14.955
<v Maddog:>a quarter of your revenues is just

1344
01:01:15.015 --> 01:01:15.636
<v Maddog:>ridiculous.

1345
01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:19.026
<v Maddog:>And so almost immediately we knew that

1346
01:01:19.288 --> 01:01:20.932
<v Maddog:>this was not a serious thing.

1347
01:01:22.802 --> 01:01:24.226
<v Maddog:>We talked to Linus about it and

1348
01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:26.713
<v Maddog:>says, "Linus, did you ever be contacted

1349
01:01:26.753 --> 01:01:28.725
<v Maddog:>by this guy?" He says, "yes, he

1350
01:01:28.767 --> 01:01:30.781
<v Maddog:>calls me up." And the first thing

1351
01:01:30.802 --> 01:01:32.005
<v Maddog:>he says to me on the phone

1352
01:01:32.165 --> 01:01:36.240
<v Maddog:>is, "do you believe in God?" And

1353
01:01:37.483 --> 01:01:40.651
<v Maddog:>that's difficult with Linus because he doesn't.

1354
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.884
<v Maddog:>And so we hired a lawyer, a

1355
01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:46.986
<v Maddog:>guy by the name of Jerry Davis,

1356
01:01:47.087 --> 01:01:49.009
<v Maddog:>who was, you know, he said he

1357
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.873
<v Maddog:>would do this work pro bono, which

1358
01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:52.115
<v Maddog:>is very generous of him.

1359
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.944
<v Maddog:>And another lawyer by the name of

1360
01:01:54.964 --> 01:01:57.671
<v Maddog:>Eric Bustani, who also worked with Jerry.

1361
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.884
<v Maddog:>And we started investigating this and we

1362
01:02:01.945 --> 01:02:04.570
<v Maddog:>found out that this person in Boston

1363
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:06.794
<v Maddog:>kept going through lawyers.

1364
01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.165
<v Maddog:>And every time we talked or tried

1365
01:02:10.205 --> 01:02:11.368
<v Maddog:>to talk to him, it was to

1366
01:02:11.388 --> 01:02:12.471
<v Maddog:>a different lawyer.

1367
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.747
<v Maddog:>And we realized that this guy was

1368
01:02:16.808 --> 01:02:17.649
<v Maddog:>kind of bonkers.

1369
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.205
<v Maddog:>So his final lawyer said to me,

1370
01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:24.012
<v Maddog:>"look, he doesn't really have a case

1371
01:02:24.112 --> 01:02:24.393
<v Maddog:>on this.

1372
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.022
<v Maddog:>And if you just pay the money

1373
01:02:27.123 --> 01:02:29.246
<v Maddog:>which he has paid to register the

1374
01:02:29.266 --> 01:02:32.170
<v Maddog:>Linux trademark, he will transfer it to

1375
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.772
<v Maddog:>somebody you want to, to do that,

1376
01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:37.622
<v Maddog:>you know, to hold it." So we

1377
01:02:37.662 --> 01:02:39.068
<v Maddog:>had him transfer it to Linus.

1378
01:02:39.068 --> 01:02:41.465
<v Maddog:>Linus now is the holder of the

1379
01:02:41.506 --> 01:02:42.349
<v Maddog:>Linux trademark.

1380
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.203
<v Maddog:>And we have we set up a

1381
01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:48.051
<v Maddog:>method of protecting and licensing the term

1382
01:02:48.191 --> 01:02:48.452
<v Maddog:>Linux.

1383
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.083
<v Maddog:>You have to do that.

1384
01:02:51.424 --> 01:02:52.587
<v Maddog:>You can't just put it into the

1385
01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:53.428
<v Maddog:>public domain.

1386
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.412
<v Maddog:>It's very bad.

1387
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.444
<v Maddog:>So people can license the term Linux

1388
01:02:57.505 --> 01:03:00.632
<v Maddog:>for any legitimate purpose, free of charge.

1389
01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.268
<v Maddog:>And we formulated a way of protecting

1390
01:03:05.328 --> 01:03:06.852
<v Maddog:>the Linux trademark legally.

1391
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:10.066
<v Maddog:>We also started a project called the

1392
01:03:10.127 --> 01:03:11.311
<v Maddog:>Linux standard base.

1393
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.386
<v Maddog:>We, that was to help people who

1394
01:03:15.426 --> 01:03:17.651
<v Maddog:>want to put binary applications and have

1395
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:19.114
<v Maddog:>them run across distributions.

1396
01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:24.111
<v Maddog:>We started a marketing campaign.

1397
01:03:25.862 --> 01:03:28.810
<v Maddog:>Having the Linux Business Expo as part

1398
01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:29.472
<v Maddog:>of Comdex.

1399
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:32.586
<v Maddog:>So this was using Linux in a

1400
01:03:32.706 --> 01:03:35.011
<v Maddog:>business case with business applications.

1401
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.029
<v Maddog:>We formulated an event at CBIT, the

1402
01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.395
<v Maddog:>world's largest computer show for a number

1403
01:03:44.435 --> 01:03:44.816
<v Maddog:>of years.

1404
01:03:45.981 --> 01:03:47.745
<v Maddog:>We went there for 17 years as

1405
01:03:48.226 --> 01:03:51.132
<v Maddog:>Linux International and participated in the Linux

1406
01:03:51.152 --> 01:03:52.234
<v Maddog:>Pavilions at CBIT.

1407
01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:54.567
<v Maddog:>We did this type of work.

1408
01:03:55.702 --> 01:03:57.246
<v Maddog:>And of course, I started going around

1409
01:03:57.286 --> 01:04:00.881
<v Maddog:>the world talking about Linux, working with

1410
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:04.689
<v Maddog:>governments and corporations to have them understand

1411
01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:07.875
<v Maddog:>about Linux and what it's going on.

1412
01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:12.868
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So in particular, I wanted to ask

1413
01:04:12.888 --> 01:04:17.355
<v Elisabetta Mori:>about your roles being a consultant for

1414
01:04:17.435 --> 01:04:18.116
<v Elisabetta Mori:>governments.

1415
01:04:18.983 --> 01:04:20.549
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I don't know what you can share

1416
01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:20.991
<v Elisabetta Mori:>with us.

1417
01:04:21.701 --> 01:04:24.646
<v Elisabetta Mori:>But if you could perhaps tell us

1418
01:04:24.666 --> 01:04:27.810
<v Elisabetta Mori:>a little bit about how you were

1419
01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:32.281
<v Elisabetta Mori:>consulted for open source software, open hardware

1420
01:04:32.342 --> 01:04:35.408
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and in general free culture with the

1421
01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:39.234
<v Elisabetta Mori:>example, so I am thinking about perhaps

1422
01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:39.755
<v Elisabetta Mori:>China.

1423
01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:43.652
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So when did you have contact with

1424
01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:44.133
<v Elisabetta Mori:>China?

1425
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.170
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And if you can summarize, you know,

1426
01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:50.295
<v Elisabetta Mori:>what was your role, what you achieved,

1427
01:04:50.862 --> 01:04:53.973
<v Elisabetta Mori:>thinking also about Malaysia, Canada, Vietnam.

1428
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.688
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So we can provide examples and also

1429
01:04:58.109 --> 01:05:00.694
<v Elisabetta Mori:>when it happened, which years.

1430
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:03.868
<v Maddog:>Sometimes I get a little hazy on

1431
01:05:03.888 --> 01:05:05.531
<v Maddog:>the years, so don't hold my feet

1432
01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:06.616
<v Maddog:>to the fire on that.

1433
01:05:06.884 --> 01:05:08.170
<v Maddog:>Let's talk about Malaysia.

1434
01:05:09.002 --> 01:05:11.928
<v Maddog:>Malaysia, the Malaysian government was creating a

1435
01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.674
<v Maddog:>five year program to use open source

1436
01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:15.236
<v Maddog:>software.

1437
01:05:16.363 --> 01:05:19.751
<v Maddog:>And Malaysia is particularly interesting because unlike

1438
01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.283
<v Maddog:>a lot of other countries, at that

1439
01:05:22.283 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Maddog:>time, 70 percent of the people that

1440
01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:27.395
<v Maddog:>were in IT were women.

1441
01:05:27.395 --> 01:05:33.813
<v Maddog:>And 70 percent of managers in younger

1442
01:05:33.873 --> 01:05:35.557
<v Maddog:>managers were women.

1443
01:05:36.502 --> 01:05:38.725
<v Maddog:>And the reason for this was that

1444
01:05:40.248 --> 01:05:42.623
<v Maddog:>men in Malaysia at the age of

1445
01:05:42.623 --> 01:05:45.075
<v Maddog:>15 could typically go out and get

1446
01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:48.127
<v Maddog:>a job doing heavy labor, digging ditches

1447
01:05:48.228 --> 01:05:49.755
<v Maddog:>and running machinery and stuff like that.

1448
01:05:49.843 --> 01:05:52.514
<v Maddog:>But women would typically not do that.

1449
01:05:53.462 --> 01:05:55.865
<v Maddog:>So women would then go on to

1450
01:05:55.966 --> 01:05:59.411
<v Maddog:>university and they would get the education

1451
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:02.816
<v Maddog:>and the skills to do data processing

1452
01:06:03.157 --> 01:06:03.818
<v Maddog:>and management.

1453
01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:07.571
<v Maddog:>And so the government of Malaysia had

1454
01:06:07.611 --> 01:06:09.581
<v Maddog:>this program at the time, had this

1455
01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:12.806
<v Maddog:>program to even this out and make

1456
01:06:12.947 --> 01:06:15.191
<v Maddog:>it 50-50 that 50 percent of the

1457
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:17.655
<v Maddog:>people would be women and 50 percent

1458
01:06:17.695 --> 01:06:18.176
<v Maddog:>would be men.

1459
01:06:19.683 --> 01:06:22.328
<v Maddog:>And at this time, they were putting

1460
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:24.755
<v Maddog:>together a program to train people and

1461
01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:25.455
<v Maddog:>stuff like that.

1462
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.225
<v Maddog:>So they invited me over to talk

1463
01:06:27.305 --> 01:06:30.353
<v Maddog:>about free software and licensing and how

1464
01:06:30.774 --> 01:06:31.496
<v Maddog:>this could be done.

1465
01:06:34.046 --> 01:06:36.512
<v Maddog:>I never really got a good report

1466
01:06:36.652 --> 01:06:38.496
<v Maddog:>back on them as the success of

1467
01:06:38.556 --> 01:06:39.138
<v Maddog:>their program.

1468
01:06:40.004 --> 01:06:41.567
<v Maddog:>But I know that Malaysia for a

1469
01:06:41.628 --> 01:06:44.073
<v Maddog:>number of years was heavily stressing free

1470
01:06:44.113 --> 01:06:45.717
<v Maddog:>software in doing this.

1471
01:06:45.717 --> 01:06:49.694
<v Maddog:>So that was Malaysia.

1472
01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:51.467
<v Maddog:>China was about 1996 when I first

1473
01:06:51.487 --> 01:06:52.107
<v Maddog:>went over to China.

1474
01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:00.314
<v Maddog:>There was a distribution called Red Flag

1475
01:07:00.554 --> 01:07:03.287
<v Maddog:>Linux, which looked a lot like Red

1476
01:07:03.688 --> 01:07:04.531
<v Maddog:>Hat Linux.

1477
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.428
<v Maddog:>I mean, very, very much like Red

1478
01:07:07.769 --> 01:07:11.144
<v Maddog:>Hat Linux, except that Red Flag Linux

1479
01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:14.231
<v Maddog:>was being sold to host offices and

1480
01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:15.875
<v Maddog:>other places by the government.

1481
01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:22.630
<v Maddog:>Eventually, Red Flag Linux was incorporated into

1482
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:26.416
<v Maddog:>another distribution of Linux called Asiatic Linux,

1483
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.267
<v Maddog:>which is used both by China, Japan

1484
01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:36.876
<v Maddog:>and South Korea as the Asiatic languages,

1485
01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:44.794
<v Maddog:>it stresses multi-byte codes like ISO codes

1486
01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:45.836
<v Maddog:>for letters.

1487
01:07:47.143 --> 01:07:49.672
<v Maddog:>And I first met with the Red

1488
01:07:49.752 --> 01:07:51.423
<v Maddog:>Flag people, and people, and then later

1489
01:07:51.624 --> 01:07:53.969
<v Maddog:>on I met with the Asiatic people

1490
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.115
<v Maddog:>at various trade shows and things like

1491
01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:56.355
<v Maddog:>that.

1492
01:08:00.227 --> 01:08:01.712
<v Maddog:>I recently went to Cuba.

1493
01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:04.949
<v Maddog:>Cuba, as you know, has had an

1494
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:07.503
<v Maddog:>embargo against it, which makes it very

1495
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Maddog:>difficult for them to use products from

1496
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.895
<v Maddog:>Microsoft or things like that.

1497
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.212
<v Maddog:>So they have refocused on using Linux.

1498
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:18.247
<v Maddog:>They have their own distribution of Linux

1499
01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:19.069
<v Maddog:>called Nova.

1500
01:08:20.581 --> 01:08:23.045
<v Maddog:>And they are also very interested in

1501
01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:27.993
<v Maddog:>some of the newer technologies like RISC-V,

1502
01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.390
<v Maddog:>which would be spread across multiple countries

1503
01:08:34.912 --> 01:08:35.253
<v Maddog:>and stuff.

1504
01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:38.468
<v Maddog:>Let's see, what other ones are you

1505
01:08:38.528 --> 01:08:39.189
<v Maddog:>interested in?

1506
01:08:41.424 --> 01:08:43.509
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Well, perhaps what you did for United

1507
01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:44.151
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Nations.

1508
01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:48.907
<v Maddog:>Oh, well, I've gone to several different

1509
01:08:49.028 --> 01:08:51.915
<v Maddog:>United Nations things.

1510
01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.886
<v Maddog:>They had a thing called WIT4 that

1511
01:08:54.906 --> 01:08:58.533
<v Maddog:>was a joint thing between Germany and

1512
01:08:58.554 --> 01:09:03.090
<v Maddog:>the United Nations in in developing countries

1513
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:05.375
<v Maddog:>and developing their technology and stuff.

1514
01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:07.965
<v Maddog:>And WIT4 was very in tune with

1515
01:09:08.066 --> 01:09:10.732
<v Maddog:>Linux and using open source software in

1516
01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:11.554
<v Maddog:>order to do that.

1517
01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:16.673
<v Maddog:>I attended several different conferences sponsored by

1518
01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:16.853
<v Maddog:>WIT4.

1519
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Maddog:>One of them was in Oman in

1520
01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:21.392
<v Maddog:>northern Africa.

1521
01:09:22.441 --> 01:09:23.826
<v Maddog:>One was in Vietnam.

1522
01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.166
<v Maddog:>So I would attend those and do

1523
01:09:30.728 --> 01:09:32.672
<v Maddog:>presentations and sit down with them and

1524
01:09:32.712 --> 01:09:35.116
<v Maddog:>talk about licensing and what licensing meant.

1525
01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:38.225
<v Maddog:>And the amount of money, the huge

1526
01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:41.251
<v Maddog:>amount of money that would be saved

1527
01:09:41.613 --> 01:09:42.595
<v Maddog:>by countries.

1528
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:45.525
<v Maddog:>And instead of sending all of that

1529
01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:48.732
<v Maddog:>in license and royalty fees back to

1530
01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.964
<v Maddog:>the United States, they instead could take

1531
01:09:52.024 --> 01:09:55.351
<v Maddog:>that money and pay local programmers to

1532
01:09:55.412 --> 01:09:59.045
<v Maddog:>improve free software, which creates local jobs,

1533
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.813
<v Maddog:>local housing, and pays local taxes.

1534
01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:04.344
<v Maddog:>And of course, that money comes back

1535
01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:09.414
<v Maddog:>to create a demand for local services

1536
01:10:09.795 --> 01:10:12.626
<v Maddog:>like programming, like systems administration, like creating

1537
01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:17.424
<v Maddog:>solutions for people, which could then generate

1538
01:10:17.525 --> 01:10:19.571
<v Maddog:>more jobs for programming.

1539
01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:24.170
<v Maddog:>So for every dollar that you send

1540
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:27.103
<v Maddog:>outside of your country, it really represents

1541
01:10:27.283 --> 01:10:29.590
<v Maddog:>ten dollars if you kept it inside

1542
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:30.151
<v Maddog:>your country.

1543
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.242
<v Maddog:>And this is one of the things

1544
01:10:32.383 --> 01:10:34.269
<v Maddog:>I've been trying to tell people over

1545
01:10:34.329 --> 01:10:34.790
<v Maddog:>the years.

1546
01:10:36.381 --> 01:10:37.526
<v Maddog:>It's very strong, I think.

1547
01:10:39.422 --> 01:10:40.949
<v Maddog:>But we have another problem.

1548
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:43.045
<v Maddog:>We can see this problem now with

1549
01:10:43.065 --> 01:10:45.010
<v Maddog:>some of the political things that are

1550
01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:45.492
<v Maddog:>going on.

1551
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:48.968
<v Maddog:>And that's what happens when some country

1552
01:10:48.988 --> 01:10:51.515
<v Maddog:>decides that they're going to do something

1553
01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:53.366
<v Maddog:>and other countries say, well, we're going

1554
01:10:53.386 --> 01:10:54.951
<v Maddog:>to create an embargo against you.

1555
01:10:56.521 --> 01:10:59.588
<v Maddog:>And for many years, there were extremely

1556
01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:01.333
<v Maddog:>good programmers in Russia.

1557
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.926
<v Maddog:>And Russia was one of the first

1558
01:11:05.367 --> 01:11:08.153
<v Maddog:>countries that really took Linux seriously.

1559
01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.985
<v Maddog:>Back in 1996, I think, I went

1560
01:11:12.026 --> 01:11:14.951
<v Maddog:>to Russia for the first time to

1561
01:11:15.152 --> 01:11:17.582
<v Maddog:>a Unix Expo, and they already had

1562
01:11:17.603 --> 01:11:18.165
<v Maddog:>Linux there.

1563
01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:22.250
<v Maddog:>And the programmers were really good.

1564
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:25.790
<v Maddog:>But now, because of the Ukraine situation,

1565
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.589
<v Maddog:>you have all these countries putting embargoes

1566
01:11:31.131 --> 01:11:32.053
<v Maddog:>on Russia.

1567
01:11:33.501 --> 01:11:36.988
<v Maddog:>And it's disrupting the flow of products

1568
01:11:37.048 --> 01:11:38.432
<v Maddog:>and things that Russians can use.

1569
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.568
<v Maddog:>So I live in a very strange

1570
01:11:42.648 --> 01:11:42.969
<v Maddog:>country.

1571
01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:47.933
<v Maddog:>I love my country, the United States.

1572
01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:49.122
<v Maddog:>But, a lot of times in the

1573
01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:52.090
<v Maddog:>United States, we don't think about what

1574
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:55.664
<v Maddog:>would happen if our access to computing

1575
01:11:56.085 --> 01:11:57.790
<v Maddog:>was turned off like that.

1576
01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.230
<v Maddog:>And so if you live outside of

1577
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:05.822
<v Maddog:>the United States, you may have to

1578
01:12:05.882 --> 01:12:07.787
<v Maddog:>think twice about where are you going

1579
01:12:07.808 --> 01:12:12.828
<v Maddog:>to get your processors, your software, things

1580
01:12:12.888 --> 01:12:13.349
<v Maddog:>like that.

1581
01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.808
<v Maddog:>Another thing is, what would happen if

1582
01:12:18.028 --> 01:12:20.401
<v Maddog:>some type of nuclear holocaust was to

1583
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:22.008
<v Maddog:>hit Redmond, Washington?

1584
01:12:23.461 --> 01:12:25.627
<v Maddog:>How long would it take Microsoft to

1585
01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:28.481
<v Maddog:>put together the engineering team to be

1586
01:12:28.541 --> 01:12:30.447
<v Maddog:>able to generate the next release of

1587
01:12:30.508 --> 01:12:30.869
<v Maddog:>Windows?

1588
01:12:32.421 --> 01:12:34.045
<v Maddog:>Even if they had the source code

1589
01:12:34.586 --> 01:12:39.082
<v Maddog:>for Windows scattered across the world, where

1590
01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.087
<v Maddog:>do they get the engineering talent, the

1591
01:12:41.127 --> 01:12:43.654
<v Maddog:>people that know that software?

1592
01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:47.769
<v Maddog:>With Linux, the source code is distributed

1593
01:12:47.849 --> 01:12:49.894
<v Maddog:>on servers all over the world.

1594
01:12:51.042 --> 01:12:52.505
<v Maddog:>And the people that know about it

1595
01:12:52.645 --> 01:12:55.751
<v Maddog:>or can know about it is spread

1596
01:12:56.192 --> 01:12:57.014
<v Maddog:>all over the world.

1597
01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:04.673
<v Maddog:>So from a geopolitical safety standpoint, you

1598
01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:05.494
<v Maddog:>have to look at that.

1599
01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:08.767
<v Maddog:>You have large countries like the United

1600
01:13:08.828 --> 01:13:11.822
<v Maddog:>States, like Russia, like China, which has

1601
01:13:11.842 --> 01:13:14.548
<v Maddog:>the people who could put together an

1602
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:16.032
<v Maddog:>operating system and maintain it.

1603
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.185
<v Maddog:>But then you have small countries like

1604
01:13:19.365 --> 01:13:22.172
<v Maddog:>Monaco or Liechtenstein.

1605
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.346
<v Maddog:>They don't have a prayer of putting

1606
01:13:25.386 --> 01:13:27.934
<v Maddog:>together the amount of engineering power they

1607
01:13:27.974 --> 01:13:28.154
<v Maddog:>need.

1608
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.523
<v Maddog:>So what they have to do is

1609
01:13:29.664 --> 01:13:32.872
<v Maddog:>cooperate with people from all over the

1610
01:13:32.932 --> 01:13:33.192
<v Maddog:>world.

1611
01:13:34.461 --> 01:13:36.786
<v Maddog:>And yet at the same time, they

1612
01:13:36.827 --> 01:13:38.711
<v Maddog:>have to be able to see the

1613
01:13:38.731 --> 01:13:41.062
<v Maddog:>source code so that they know that

1614
01:13:41.082 --> 01:13:44.128
<v Maddog:>these other countries are not putting Trojan

1615
01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:46.172
<v Maddog:>horses and things like that into it.

1616
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.769
<v Maddog:>Microsoft, as an example, has places around

1617
01:13:52.809 --> 01:13:55.034
<v Maddog:>the world where you can go.

1618
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.664
<v Maddog:>You have to leave your laptop outside,

1619
01:13:57.704 --> 01:13:59.830
<v Maddog:>your phone outside, your pencil and paper

1620
01:13:59.891 --> 01:14:00.251
<v Maddog:>outside.

1621
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.723
<v Maddog:>They will allow you to look over

1622
01:14:02.783 --> 01:14:05.828
<v Maddog:>the Internet at code that they say

1623
01:14:05.848 --> 01:14:08.633
<v Maddog:>is the source code for Microsoft products.

1624
01:14:10.521 --> 01:14:10.802
<v Maddog:>Really?

1625
01:14:11.884 --> 01:14:12.526
<v Maddog:>How do you know?

1626
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:15.373
<v Maddog:>And what is the product you're looking

1627
01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:15.553
<v Maddog:>at?

1628
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:18.785
<v Maddog:>And are you sure that the code

1629
01:14:18.805 --> 01:14:20.748
<v Maddog:>you're looking at is actually the code

1630
01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:23.052
<v Maddog:>that went into the product that you

1631
01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.014
<v Maddog:>got from Microsoft?

1632
01:14:25.401 --> 01:14:27.267
<v Maddog:>And the answer is you don't know.

1633
01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.245
<v Maddog:>So all these things are things that

1634
01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.051
<v Maddog:>need to be looked at and need

1635
01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.114
<v Maddog:>to be thought about by leaders.

1636
01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:39.825
<v Maddog:>And this is the type of thing

1637
01:14:39.985 --> 01:14:41.048
<v Maddog:>I talk to them about.

1638
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.184
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So I would like to talk about

1639
01:14:46.204 --> 01:14:52.393
<v Elisabetta Mori:>a few things, not too much extensively,

1640
01:14:52.453 --> 01:14:54.496
<v Elisabetta Mori:>then we can move to another topic.

1641
01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.887
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So first is your role in the

1642
01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.791
<v Elisabetta Mori:>board as a board chair of the

1643
01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.473
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Linux Professional Institute.

1644
01:15:03.861 --> 01:15:05.565
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So if you can briefly say what

1645
01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:09.251
<v Elisabetta Mori:>it is and what's your role there.

1646
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.384
<v Maddog:>So the board of directors of any

1647
01:15:14.464 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Maddog:>organization is responsible for the fiscal and

1648
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:24.022
<v Maddog:>legal actions of the organization itself to

1649
01:15:24.063 --> 01:15:26.589
<v Maddog:>make sure that in our case, we're

1650
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:27.914
<v Maddog:>a membership organization.

1651
01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:31.026
<v Maddog:>Are we doing the proper things for

1652
01:15:31.066 --> 01:15:31.647
<v Maddog:>the members?

1653
01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:36.316
<v Maddog:>Are we handling the finances correctly?

1654
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.169
<v Maddog:>Is the organization going to go into

1655
01:15:39.289 --> 01:15:40.010
<v Maddog:>bankruptcy?

1656
01:15:41.882 --> 01:15:43.546
<v Maddog:>Are we doing things in a legal

1657
01:15:43.586 --> 01:15:45.030
<v Maddog:>way that we're doing things in a

1658
01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:46.934
<v Maddog:>fair matter?

1659
01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:49.583
<v Maddog:>So as an example, one of the

1660
01:15:49.624 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Maddog:>things we did recently was a diversity

1661
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:58.277
<v Maddog:>and inclusion policy for for our organization

1662
01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:02.688
<v Maddog:>because we have two hundred fifteen thousand

1663
01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:05.934
<v Maddog:>certified people in one hundred eighty countries

1664
01:16:05.954 --> 01:16:06.695
<v Maddog:>around the world.

1665
01:16:07.844 --> 01:16:08.628
<v Maddog:>That sounds great.

1666
01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.503
<v Maddog:>But on the other hand, are we

1667
01:16:11.543 --> 01:16:14.848
<v Maddog:>making sure that in these different countries

1668
01:16:15.369 --> 01:16:21.260
<v Maddog:>that women get equal representation, that gay

1669
01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:23.949
<v Maddog:>people get equal representation?

1670
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.682
<v Maddog:>And we say when we say equal,

1671
01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:30.768
<v Maddog:>we mean that the membership of LPI

1672
01:16:31.109 --> 01:16:34.454
<v Maddog:>should reflect the population of these countries.

1673
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.644
<v Maddog:>I mean, it'd be close to impossible

1674
01:16:38.965 --> 01:16:41.931
<v Maddog:>to get 16 percent of the population

1675
01:16:41.971 --> 01:16:45.242
<v Maddog:>of Africa to be black because there

1676
01:16:45.242 --> 01:16:49.531
<v Maddog:>aren't 16, 16 percent of say Africa,

1677
01:16:49.531 --> 01:16:50.292
<v Maddog:>Alaska, 16 percent.

1678
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.625
<v Maddog:>There aren't 16 percent of the people

1679
01:16:53.685 --> 01:16:55.391
<v Maddog:>in Alaska who are black.

1680
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.723
<v Maddog:>So to say that we're going to

1681
01:16:57.723 --> 01:16:59.867
<v Maddog:>have 16 percent of the programmers in

1682
01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:02.312
<v Maddog:>Alaska be black is kind of hard.

1683
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.923
<v Maddog:>So on the other hand, if it's

1684
01:17:05.963 --> 01:17:09.510
<v Maddog:>in Africa and a large population, the

1685
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:11.974
<v Maddog:>large percentage of that population is black,

1686
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.025
<v Maddog:>then maybe we should be a little

1687
01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:19.591
<v Maddog:>suspect if 70 percent of the programmers

1688
01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:20.293
<v Maddog:>are white.

1689
01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.003
<v Maddog:>And so we should be working to

1690
01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:26.927
<v Maddog:>make the different populations that we are

1691
01:17:26.967 --> 01:17:30.853
<v Maddog:>responsible for match the populations of the

1692
01:17:30.993 --> 01:17:31.835
<v Maddog:>areas that we're in.

1693
01:17:33.781 --> 01:17:37.867
<v Maddog:>And likewise, the economic scale, we need

1694
01:17:37.888 --> 01:17:40.933
<v Maddog:>to make sure that as much as

1695
01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:42.916
<v Maddog:>possible, as much as we can influence,

1696
01:17:43.741 --> 01:17:46.267
<v Maddog:>that people are up and down the

1697
01:17:46.587 --> 01:17:50.174
<v Maddog:>pay scale matching the population.

1698
01:17:50.175 --> 01:17:53.911
<v Maddog:>Okay, so this is what we worked

1699
01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:55.094
<v Maddog:>into our policy.

1700
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.465
<v Maddog:>And this is now a focal point

1701
01:17:57.826 --> 01:18:00.011
<v Maddog:>of what LPI is doing along with

1702
01:18:00.031 --> 01:18:01.293
<v Maddog:>the other things that we're trying to

1703
01:18:01.334 --> 01:18:05.106
<v Maddog:>do, which is create a professional aspect

1704
01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:07.711
<v Maddog:>to free and open source software programming

1705
01:18:07.931 --> 01:18:08.692
<v Maddog:>and administration.

1706
01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.985
<v Maddog:>Now, as the board chair, I'm responsible

1707
01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:16.549
<v Maddog:>for driving this, for making sure that

1708
01:18:16.569 --> 01:18:19.974
<v Maddog:>the board members have equal input to

1709
01:18:20.014 --> 01:18:21.676
<v Maddog:>these policies and things like that.

1710
01:18:22.461 --> 01:18:24.786
<v Maddog:>We're about to have our annual general

1711
01:18:24.846 --> 01:18:27.832
<v Maddog:>meeting in June, invite all of our

1712
01:18:27.893 --> 01:18:29.155
<v Maddog:>members to participate.

1713
01:18:29.823 --> 01:18:31.630
<v Maddog:>We're coming up with elections for the

1714
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:32.232
<v Maddog:>new board.

1715
01:18:33.363 --> 01:18:35.106
<v Maddog:>And these are some of the things

1716
01:18:35.126 --> 01:18:36.550
<v Maddog:>that I have to make sure are

1717
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:37.051
<v Maddog:>being done.

1718
01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:43.750
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So in on June 24, 2012, you

1719
01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:50.775
<v Elisabetta Mori:>wrote you actually published an article.

1720
01:18:52.921 --> 01:18:56.447
<v Elisabetta Mori:>The title is in horror in honor

1721
01:18:56.547 --> 01:18:59.332
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of Alan Turing, and that was on

1722
01:18:59.973 --> 01:19:00.914
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Linux magazine.

1723
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.046
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you tell us more about this?

1724
01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:08.287
<v Maddog:>Yes, I am gay.

1725
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.462
<v Maddog:>One of the nice things about the

1726
01:19:11.502 --> 01:19:14.266
<v Maddog:>computer industry is that they have been

1727
01:19:14.346 --> 01:19:19.353
<v Maddog:>relatively accepting of LGBTQ people from as

1728
01:19:19.393 --> 01:19:20.775
<v Maddog:>long back as I can remember.

1729
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.728
<v Maddog:>I've mentioned DECA several times.

1730
01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.983
<v Maddog:>You would go to DECA's and they

1731
01:19:26.024 --> 01:19:29.430
<v Maddog:>would have special interest groups of LGBT

1732
01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:30.933
<v Maddog:>LGBTQ people.

1733
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.464
<v Maddog:>The Eustics Association that's located in California

1734
01:19:37.265 --> 01:19:39.407
<v Maddog:>would have conferences and they would have

1735
01:19:40.368 --> 01:19:43.630
<v Maddog:>their groups, their local groups of LGBTQ

1736
01:19:43.671 --> 01:19:46.674
<v Maddog:>people join the first night of a

1737
01:19:46.814 --> 01:19:49.957
<v Maddog:>conference and tell people you're safe here.

1738
01:19:50.581 --> 01:19:51.986
<v Maddog:>You know, you can you can be

1739
01:19:52.026 --> 01:19:52.668
<v Maddog:>yourself here.

1740
01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:58.706
<v Maddog:>But I was still relatively closeted, not

1741
01:19:58.786 --> 01:20:00.228
<v Maddog:>because I felt that I would be

1742
01:20:00.348 --> 01:20:03.512
<v Maddog:>persecuted by being gay, but I just

1743
01:20:03.572 --> 01:20:06.176
<v Maddog:>felt no real need to talk about

1744
01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:06.276
<v Maddog:>it.

1745
01:20:07.361 --> 01:20:09.512
<v Maddog:>And my life is going along fine.

1746
01:20:09.512 --> 01:20:12.867
<v Maddog:>I I was perfectly happy, you know,

1747
01:20:13.169 --> 01:20:15.514
<v Maddog:>working for DECA, working at the school

1748
01:20:15.554 --> 01:20:16.015
<v Maddog:>with things.

1749
01:20:16.943 --> 01:20:18.670
<v Maddog:>And, you know, I just did.

1750
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:20.969
<v Maddog:>If people had asked me, are you

1751
01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:21.231
<v Maddog:>gay?

1752
01:20:21.281 --> 01:20:22.226
<v Maddog:>I would have told them.

1753
01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.545
<v Maddog:>But there was no need to.

1754
01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:32.331
<v Maddog:>However, about the year 2000, people started

1755
01:20:32.351 --> 01:20:34.234
<v Maddog:>to talk about marriage equality.

1756
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.989
<v Maddog:>Why can't gay people get married?

1757
01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.188
<v Maddog:>Why can't LGBTQ people get married?

1758
01:20:40.621 --> 01:20:42.847
<v Maddog:>And people started off with things like

1759
01:20:44.511 --> 01:20:45.313
<v Maddog:>civil unions.

1760
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:47.605
<v Maddog:>But there was a lot of legal

1761
01:20:47.665 --> 01:20:49.391
<v Maddog:>problems with civil unions.

1762
01:20:50.841 --> 01:20:52.264
<v Maddog:>I have been the justice of the

1763
01:20:52.364 --> 01:20:54.146
<v Maddog:>peace in New Hampshire for the last

1764
01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:56.732
<v Maddog:>30 years, which means that I can

1765
01:20:56.772 --> 01:20:58.634
<v Maddog:>perform wedding ceremonies.

1766
01:20:59.742 --> 01:21:01.809
<v Maddog:>I can take two people and make

1767
01:21:01.869 --> 01:21:02.913
<v Maddog:>them husband and wife.

1768
01:21:04.002 --> 01:21:08.453
<v Maddog:>But I am just a witness of

1769
01:21:08.533 --> 01:21:08.714
<v Maddog:>this.

1770
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:11.150
<v Maddog:>Basically, I lead them through.

1771
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:12.344
<v Maddog:>I I am what is known as

1772
01:21:12.506 --> 01:21:13.248
<v Maddog:>an officiant.

1773
01:21:14.521 --> 01:21:17.045
<v Maddog:>And I recognize that it's the state

1774
01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:21.274
<v Maddog:>that controls marriage, not the church.

1775
01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:24.469
<v Maddog:>The church can give their blessing to

1776
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.891
<v Maddog:>a marriage.

1777
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:25.624
<v Maddog:>That's fine.

1778
01:21:26.421 --> 01:21:28.449
<v Maddog:>The church can be an officiant to

1779
01:21:28.489 --> 01:21:28.931
<v Maddog:>a marriage.

1780
01:21:29.241 --> 01:21:29.865
<v Maddog:>That's fine.

1781
01:21:30.862 --> 01:21:32.686
<v Maddog:>But unless you have a marriage license

1782
01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:34.952
<v Maddog:>from the state, you're not going to

1783
01:21:34.992 --> 01:21:35.493
<v Maddog:>be married.

1784
01:21:36.742 --> 01:21:38.610
<v Maddog:>And it's the state that controls things

1785
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:39.634
<v Maddog:>like inheritance.

1786
01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:42.047
<v Maddog:>It's the state that controls things like

1787
01:21:42.388 --> 01:21:44.533
<v Maddog:>when you get divorced, who gets whatever.

1788
01:21:46.163 --> 01:21:48.489
<v Maddog:>So I started to follow this because

1789
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.893
<v Maddog:>I am a justice of the peace.

1790
01:21:51.321 --> 01:21:53.204
<v Maddog:>And I started to see a lot

1791
01:21:53.244 --> 01:21:56.068
<v Maddog:>of hostility that I had never experienced

1792
01:21:56.128 --> 01:22:01.316
<v Maddog:>before of the general population being against

1793
01:22:01.436 --> 01:22:02.057
<v Maddog:>gay people.

1794
01:22:03.342 --> 01:22:06.146
<v Maddog:>And I started seeing young people being

1795
01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:09.631
<v Maddog:>thrown out of their house, being abandoned

1796
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:12.796
<v Maddog:>by their families just because they are

1797
01:22:12.856 --> 01:22:13.137
<v Maddog:>gay.

1798
01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:16.554
<v Maddog:>And this started to make me angry.

1799
01:22:17.843 --> 01:22:20.207
<v Maddog:>And I started to participate in the

1800
01:22:20.287 --> 01:22:24.435
<v Maddog:>New Hampshire push to get marriage equality

1801
01:22:24.655 --> 01:22:25.377
<v Maddog:>in New Hampshire.

1802
01:22:26.765 --> 01:22:29.773
<v Maddog:>Now, other states had, like I said,

1803
01:22:29.793 --> 01:22:30.776
<v Maddog:>had civil unions.

1804
01:22:30.776 --> 01:22:32.512
<v Maddog:>California had a civil union.

1805
01:22:33.384 --> 01:22:36.193
<v Maddog:>Massachusetts had a civil union.

1806
01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:39.467
<v Maddog:>But then their court system forced them

1807
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.434
<v Maddog:>to turn it from civil union into

1808
01:22:42.454 --> 01:22:42.955
<v Maddog:>marriage.

1809
01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:46.626
<v Maddog:>And in New Hampshire, we were the

1810
01:22:46.706 --> 01:22:50.291
<v Maddog:>first state not to have the justice,

1811
01:22:50.312 --> 01:22:52.675
<v Maddog:>not that the courts forced us to

1812
01:22:52.736 --> 01:22:55.604
<v Maddog:>do it, but instead have our legislature

1813
01:22:56.165 --> 01:22:58.489
<v Maddog:>vote to do it and our governors

1814
01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:00.774
<v Maddog:>sign it into law.

1815
01:23:02.301 --> 01:23:04.829
<v Maddog:>And I participated in pushing that.

1816
01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:09.146
<v Maddog:>But there was still a large portion

1817
01:23:09.166 --> 01:23:10.869
<v Maddog:>of the United States where kids were

1818
01:23:10.909 --> 01:23:12.553
<v Maddog:>still being thrown out of their house.

1819
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.108
<v Maddog:>And I just I just couldn't take

1820
01:23:17.169 --> 01:23:19.639
<v Maddog:>that because, you know, when you're growing

1821
01:23:19.821 --> 01:23:23.365
<v Maddog:>up and you're fat and you're geekish

1822
01:23:24.287 --> 01:23:26.249
<v Maddog:>and you're bullied in school because you're

1823
01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:30.014
<v Maddog:>a geek, it's twice as bad when

1824
01:23:30.034 --> 01:23:30.995
<v Maddog:>you're also gay.

1825
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.808
<v Maddog:>So if you're geek and gay, it's

1826
01:23:34.928 --> 01:23:36.151
<v Maddog:>really intolerable.

1827
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.525
<v Maddog:>And five times the number of kids

1828
01:23:43.009 --> 01:23:45.533
<v Maddog:>go to suicide who are gay than

1829
01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:46.835
<v Maddog:>in the normal population.

1830
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.323
<v Maddog:>For every kid in the normal population

1831
01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:53.829
<v Maddog:>that goes to suicide, five times the

1832
01:23:53.889 --> 01:23:56.534
<v Maddog:>number in the LGBTQ community.

1833
01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:58.763
<v Maddog:>And this is wrong.

1834
01:24:00.761 --> 01:24:03.245
<v Maddog:>And so I wrote that article for

1835
01:24:03.325 --> 01:24:04.968
<v Maddog:>all the geeky gay kids that are

1836
01:24:05.008 --> 01:24:08.434
<v Maddog:>out there to say, you know, it's

1837
01:24:08.514 --> 01:24:10.016
<v Maddog:>OK that you're gay.

1838
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:12.187
<v Maddog:>It's OK that you're lesbian.

1839
01:24:12.387 --> 01:24:13.852
<v Maddog:>It's OK that you're trans.

1840
01:24:14.401 --> 01:24:15.365
<v Maddog:>It doesn't hurt me.

1841
01:24:15.787 --> 01:24:16.991
<v Maddog:>It doesn't hurt anybody else.

1842
01:24:18.102 --> 01:24:21.267
<v Maddog:>And if you know, I'm not telling

1843
01:24:21.367 --> 01:24:24.012
<v Maddog:>everybody to come out because you have

1844
01:24:24.052 --> 01:24:25.816
<v Maddog:>to make that in your own decision.

1845
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.048
<v Maddog:>Your own time is something you have

1846
01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:28.650
<v Maddog:>to determine.

1847
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:31.747
<v Maddog:>But I am telling you that sooner

1848
01:24:31.808 --> 01:24:33.191
<v Maddog:>or later it will get better.

1849
01:24:34.781 --> 01:24:36.945
<v Maddog:>And, you know, so I wrote that

1850
01:24:37.046 --> 01:24:38.929
<v Maddog:>article, I published that and I published

1851
01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:42.781
<v Maddog:>that because Alan Turing, considered to be

1852
01:24:42.822 --> 01:24:45.126
<v Maddog:>the father of computer science, the father

1853
01:24:45.388 --> 01:24:49.602
<v Maddog:>of artificial intelligence and who during World

1854
01:24:49.642 --> 01:24:53.068
<v Maddog:>War II saved an estimated 14 billion

1855
01:24:53.148 --> 01:24:56.293
<v Maddog:>lives and cut World War II short

1856
01:24:56.414 --> 01:24:59.682
<v Maddog:>by about two years, was himself gay,

1857
01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:04.128
<v Maddog:>was persecuted for it, and many people

1858
01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:06.156
<v Maddog:>say committed suicide in 1954.

1859
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.927
<v Maddog:>I wish I could have met Alan

1860
01:25:11.967 --> 01:25:12.329
<v Maddog:>Turing.

1861
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.003
<v Maddog:>I've been lucky enough to meet other

1862
01:25:15.063 --> 01:25:18.530
<v Maddog:>people like Grace Barry Hopper, who I

1863
01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:20.413
<v Maddog:>consider to be the first modern day

1864
01:25:21.034 --> 01:25:26.850
<v Maddog:>programmer, or Maurice Wilkes, who invented microcode

1865
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:27.792
<v Maddog:>and subroutines.

1866
01:25:29.481 --> 01:25:30.163
<v Maddog:>I've met them.

1867
01:25:30.323 --> 01:25:32.670
<v Maddog:>I've met lots of people and I've

1868
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:33.573
<v Maddog:>known lots more.

1869
01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.907
<v Maddog:>You know, like Hedy Lamarr, well-known actress,

1870
01:25:38.309 --> 01:25:40.434
<v Maddog:>but also the person who developed the

1871
01:25:40.514 --> 01:25:46.128
<v Maddog:>underpinnings for modern day Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and

1872
01:25:46.148 --> 01:25:49.914
<v Maddog:>split-spectrum programming or split-spectrum technology.

1873
01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.869
<v Maddog:>So, you know, I admire these people.

1874
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.064
<v Maddog:>And after I wrote that article, I

1875
01:25:58.084 --> 01:26:00.086
<v Maddog:>would go to a conference and I

1876
01:26:00.126 --> 01:26:01.789
<v Maddog:>would have young people walk up to

1877
01:26:01.829 --> 01:26:03.370
<v Maddog:>me and say thank you for writing

1878
01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:03.931
<v Maddog:>that article.

1879
01:26:08.441 --> 01:26:08.943
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.

1880
01:26:10.468 --> 01:26:11.150
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I'm just curious.

1881
01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.083
<v Maddog:>I will also say that 10 years

1882
01:26:14.163 --> 01:26:17.248
<v Maddog:>ago, I met somebody that we fell

1883
01:26:17.308 --> 01:26:19.352
<v Maddog:>in love and in 2017, I married

1884
01:26:19.352 --> 01:26:19.452
<v Maddog:>him.

1885
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.066
<v Maddog:>He's now my husband and we're trying

1886
01:26:24.107 --> 01:26:25.632
<v Maddog:>to get him a permanent visa for

1887
01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:26.334
<v Maddog:>the United States.

1888
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:27.964
<v Maddog:>He's actually Brazilian.

1889
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:32.882
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Sounds lovely.

1890
01:26:36.502 --> 01:26:37.969
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Let's talk about Brazil.

1891
01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:43.712
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So there is another Maddog, Maddogs in

1892
01:26:43.752 --> 01:26:44.113
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Brazil.

1893
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:51.432
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I'm talking about Caninos Lucas, Mad Dogs.

1894
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.544
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So can you explain what it is

1895
01:26:55.965 --> 01:26:59.792
<v Elisabetta Mori:>and how you became involved in it?

1896
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.203
<v Maddog:>So in 1994, I'm sorry, it must

1897
01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:03.997
<v Maddog:>have been 1996.

1898
01:27:03.997 --> 01:27:11.548
<v Maddog:>In 1996, I went to Sao Paulo,

1899
01:27:11.588 --> 01:27:12.892
<v Maddog:>Brazil for the first time.

1900
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.108
<v Maddog:>There was a free software conference down

1901
01:27:16.128 --> 01:27:16.289
<v Maddog:>there.

1902
01:27:17.721 --> 01:27:20.526
<v Maddog:>And, you know, so I often ask

1903
01:27:20.566 --> 01:27:23.251
<v Maddog:>people, what do you think about when

1904
01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:25.194
<v Maddog:>you think about Brazil?

1905
01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.388
<v Maddog:>You know, and people say, oh, soccer

1906
01:27:29.508 --> 01:27:31.092
<v Maddog:>or football, however you call it.

1907
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.568
<v Maddog:>And they think about the Amazon and

1908
01:27:34.588 --> 01:27:35.431
<v Maddog:>the rainforest.

1909
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.349
<v Maddog:>And they think about Samba and, you

1910
01:27:39.389 --> 01:27:40.773
<v Maddog:>know, all these different things.

1911
01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.847
<v Maddog:>They think about Piranha, you know, the

1912
01:27:42.907 --> 01:27:43.128
<v Maddog:>fish.

1913
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:46.025
<v Maddog:>But they don't think about the fact

1914
01:27:46.566 --> 01:27:48.912
<v Maddog:>that Brazil is the 12th largest economy

1915
01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:49.453
<v Maddog:>in the world.

1916
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.883
<v Maddog:>They don't think about the fact that

1917
01:27:51.923 --> 01:27:54.808
<v Maddog:>Sao Paulo is the second largest city

1918
01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:58.875
<v Maddog:>in the western hemisphere after only Mexico

1919
01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:01.428
<v Maddog:>City, with New York being far down

1920
01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:01.951
<v Maddog:>the line.

1921
01:28:02.881 --> 01:28:05.184
<v Maddog:>They don't think about the fact that

1922
01:28:05.244 --> 01:28:07.548
<v Maddog:>the University of Sao Paulo has 100,000

1923
01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:08.730
<v Maddog:>students and 16,000 PhDs.

1924
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.885
<v Maddog:>It is the number one university in

1925
01:28:15.086 --> 01:28:16.311
<v Maddog:>all of Latin America.

1926
01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:19.008
<v Maddog:>They don't think about those things.

1927
01:28:20.321 --> 01:28:22.929
<v Maddog:>And so I got to know this.

1928
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.744
<v Maddog:>I got to know some of the

1929
01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:28.291
<v Maddog:>faculty at the University of Sao Paulo,

1930
01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.026
<v Maddog:>and particularly somebody named Dr.

1931
01:28:31.327 --> 01:28:32.210
<v Maddog:>Marcelo Zufo.

1932
01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:38.369
<v Maddog:>And he showed me the first Beowulf

1933
01:28:38.409 --> 01:28:41.134
<v Maddog:>supercomputer that I'd ever seen in real

1934
01:28:41.194 --> 01:28:41.395
<v Maddog:>life.

1935
01:28:42.643 --> 01:28:44.049
<v Maddog:>I had seen pictures of them.

1936
01:28:44.261 --> 01:28:45.807
<v Maddog:>I had actually talked with people who

1937
01:28:45.827 --> 01:28:46.409
<v Maddog:>had made them.

1938
01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.305
<v Maddog:>But he was actually using one to

1939
01:28:49.345 --> 01:28:50.527
<v Maddog:>do really good research.

1940
01:28:53.522 --> 01:28:55.048
<v Maddog:>And I was very impressed by this.

1941
01:28:56.763 --> 01:28:58.771
<v Maddog:>And so I stayed in touch with

1942
01:28:58.831 --> 01:28:58.991
<v Maddog:>him.

1943
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.383
<v Maddog:>And I started going to more and

1944
01:29:01.424 --> 01:29:04.769
<v Maddog:>more of these conferences, not only in

1945
01:29:04.829 --> 01:29:07.933
<v Maddog:>Brazil, but all over Latin America.

1946
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:13.109
<v Maddog:>And I saw amazing things, things that

1947
01:29:13.209 --> 01:29:15.614
<v Maddog:>people in the United States would do.

1948
01:29:17.222 --> 01:29:21.050
<v Maddog:>And so eventually, about the time that

1949
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:24.441
<v Maddog:>the Raspberry Pi came out, I had

1950
01:29:24.481 --> 01:29:26.607
<v Maddog:>met some of the board members of

1951
01:29:26.647 --> 01:29:28.111
<v Maddog:>the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

1952
01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.163
<v Maddog:>And I invited one of those to

1953
01:29:31.244 --> 01:29:33.628
<v Maddog:>come to Brazil to a large event

1954
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:35.772
<v Maddog:>and see the types of things that

1955
01:29:36.092 --> 01:29:36.754
<v Maddog:>I had seen.

1956
01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.369
<v Maddog:>And he came down and he looked

1957
01:29:40.409 --> 01:29:40.610
<v Maddog:>at it.

1958
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.566
<v Maddog:>And I said, "you know, a $35

1959
01:29:44.065 --> 01:29:46.929
<v Maddog:>Raspberry Pi by the time it gets

1960
01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:48.973
<v Maddog:>to the Brazilian market costs 150 US

1961
01:29:48.973 --> 01:29:54.708
<v Maddog:>dollars." And this completely negates why you

1962
01:29:54.728 --> 01:29:56.572
<v Maddog:>invited you invented the Raspberry Pi in

1963
01:29:56.592 --> 01:29:57.213
<v Maddog:>the first place.

1964
01:29:58.461 --> 01:30:01.267
<v Maddog:>You want a very cheap computer that

1965
01:30:01.467 --> 01:30:03.331
<v Maddog:>any high school student could afford to

1966
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:03.592
<v Maddog:>have.

1967
01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:08.349
<v Maddog:>And, you know, in Brazil, it's just

1968
01:30:08.389 --> 01:30:08.991
<v Maddog:>not happening.

1969
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.947
<v Maddog:>So why don't we manufacture the Raspberry

1970
01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:14.111
<v Maddog:>Pi in Brazil?

1971
01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:16.564
<v Maddog:>We license it from you.

1972
01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:18.750
<v Maddog:>It's a cooperative manufacturing.

1973
01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.923
<v Maddog:>And it would be a lot cheaper

1974
01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:25.009
<v Maddog:>because you don't have this huge customs

1975
01:30:25.049 --> 01:30:27.393
<v Maddog:>duty for shipping that you have to

1976
01:30:27.433 --> 01:30:27.593
<v Maddog:>pay.

1977
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:32.088
<v Maddog:>So we partnered with the University of

1978
01:30:32.128 --> 01:30:33.212
<v Maddog:>São Paulo on that.

1979
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.206
<v Maddog:>They have a surface mount technology line

1980
01:30:36.246 --> 01:30:37.730
<v Maddog:>and they have the expertise to do

1981
01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:37.911
<v Maddog:>this.

1982
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.406
<v Maddog:>And we spent two years making these

1983
01:30:42.406 --> 01:30:45.513
<v Maddog:>baking 10 Raspberry Pies to show the

1984
01:30:45.553 --> 01:30:46.875
<v Maddog:>Raspberry Pi Foundation.

1985
01:30:47.982 --> 01:30:49.926
<v Maddog:>And after the two years, they said,

1986
01:30:50.167 --> 01:30:51.951
<v Maddog:>no, we're not going to let you

1987
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:52.311
<v Maddog:>do this.

1988
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.326
<v Maddog:>So I at that point, I had

1989
01:30:57.386 --> 01:30:59.710
<v Maddog:>known of a little company in China,

1990
01:31:00.652 --> 01:31:02.675
<v Maddog:>Shenzhen, China, named Le Maker.

1991
01:31:04.063 --> 01:31:07.291
<v Maddog:>And I had met them at Seabit.

1992
01:31:08.401 --> 01:31:10.969
<v Maddog:>I had helped them become involved in

1993
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.431
<v Maddog:>Seabit.

1994
01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:14.706
<v Maddog:>And they said, well, we have a

1995
01:31:14.987 --> 01:31:17.393
<v Maddog:>wonderful little system called the guitar.

1996
01:31:18.901 --> 01:31:20.664
<v Maddog:>And what we can do is you

1997
01:31:20.704 --> 01:31:22.828
<v Maddog:>can license the guitar from us and

1998
01:31:22.868 --> 01:31:26.854
<v Maddog:>manufacture the guitar in Brazil.

1999
01:31:28.502 --> 01:31:30.147
<v Maddog:>So we started doing that.

2000
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.283
<v Maddog:>And there was a lot of work

2001
01:31:33.323 --> 01:31:35.627
<v Maddog:>to be done and re-engineering and stuff

2002
01:31:35.988 --> 01:31:39.112
<v Maddog:>on the guitar that eventually became known

2003
01:31:39.173 --> 01:31:39.954
<v Maddog:>as the Labrador.

2004
01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.845
<v Maddog:>That we are now ready to manufacture

2005
01:31:44.905 --> 01:31:48.009
<v Maddog:>and sell in Brazil, which is a

2006
01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:52.875
<v Maddog:>little little computer, much like the Raspberry

2007
01:31:52.955 --> 01:31:53.216
<v Maddog:>Pi.

2008
01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:57.471
<v Maddog:>Except it has two boards to it.

2009
01:31:58.461 --> 01:32:00.928
<v Maddog:>One board has the CPU, the GPU

2010
01:32:01.209 --> 01:32:02.613
<v Maddog:>and all the high speed components.

2011
01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.244
<v Maddog:>And the other board has the connectors

2012
01:32:05.805 --> 01:32:09.452
<v Maddog:>like USB connectors and HDMI connectors on

2013
01:32:09.513 --> 01:32:09.573
<v Maddog:>it.

2014
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.670
<v Maddog:>So we're doing this in Brazil.

2015
01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:16.646
<v Maddog:>We also have a tiny little computer

2016
01:32:16.706 --> 01:32:19.072
<v Maddog:>about the size of a US quarter.

2017
01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:24.090
<v Maddog:>And it has a M4, ARM M4

2018
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:25.734
<v Maddog:>microcontroller on it.

2019
01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:30.108
<v Maddog:>It is used to gather data, heat,

2020
01:32:30.288 --> 01:32:33.014
<v Maddog:>light, humidity, vibration, things like that.

2021
01:32:34.581 --> 01:32:39.514
<v Maddog:>And that's another one that we're producing.

2022
01:32:39.842 --> 01:32:42.411
<v Maddog:>We call that the Pulga because it's

2023
01:32:42.451 --> 01:32:43.555
<v Maddog:>a tiny little computer.

2024
01:32:43.555 --> 01:32:44.624
<v Maddog:>We were going to call it the

2025
01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:47.232
<v Maddog:>Chihuahua, but we realized that not everybody

2026
01:32:47.272 --> 01:32:48.054
<v Maddog:>likes Chihuahuas.

2027
01:32:48.054 --> 01:32:49.864
<v Maddog:>So So we call it the Pulga,

2028
01:32:50.305 --> 01:32:53.412
<v Maddog:>which is Portuguese for flea, because all

2029
01:32:53.452 --> 01:32:54.574
<v Maddog:>dogs have fleas.

2030
01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.431
<v Maddog:>And that's another one that we're producing.

2031
01:32:59.762 --> 01:33:02.411
<v Maddog:>Now, you, of course, need software to

2032
01:33:02.431 --> 01:33:03.274
<v Maddog:>put on top of this.

2033
01:33:03.782 --> 01:33:05.968
<v Maddog:>We chose the Debian operating system.

2034
01:33:08.522 --> 01:33:10.308
<v Maddog:>But then we said, well, how are

2035
01:33:10.349 --> 01:33:11.473
<v Maddog:>people going to use this?

2036
01:33:11.682 --> 01:33:13.829
<v Maddog:>Because I will say something to you

2037
01:33:13.869 --> 01:33:14.751
<v Maddog:>that's very strange.

2038
01:33:15.963 --> 01:33:17.469
<v Maddog:>People do not buy software.

2039
01:33:18.402 --> 01:33:19.808
<v Maddog:>They do not buy hardware.

2040
01:33:20.662 --> 01:33:22.811
<v Maddog:>They buy solutions to a problem.

2041
01:33:24.003 --> 01:33:26.070
<v Maddog:>And maybe the problem is a game

2042
01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:26.692
<v Maddog:>with somebody.

2043
01:33:27.862 --> 01:33:29.989
<v Maddog:>And computers, you can play the game

2044
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:31.374
<v Maddog:>over the Internet with somebody.

2045
01:33:31.374 --> 01:33:32.808
<v Maddog:>So you buy the computer to play

2046
01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:33.190
<v Maddog:>the game.

2047
01:33:33.661 --> 01:33:36.008
<v Maddog:>But playing the game is a problem

2048
01:33:36.028 --> 01:33:36.851
<v Maddog:>you want to solve.

2049
01:33:38.581 --> 01:33:40.787
<v Maddog:>So we realized that not everybody is

2050
01:33:40.868 --> 01:33:43.194
<v Maddog:>buying a Labrador or a Pulga.

2051
01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:45.948
<v Maddog:>What they're buying is a component that

2052
01:33:45.968 --> 01:33:47.212
<v Maddog:>they're going to use to solve a

2053
01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:47.613
<v Maddog:>problem.

2054
01:33:48.901 --> 01:33:53.248
<v Maddog:>And so we started creating mega solutions

2055
01:33:53.348 --> 01:33:56.152
<v Maddog:>to problems that can be handled with

2056
01:33:56.232 --> 01:33:58.456
<v Maddog:>the Labrador and the Pulga.

2057
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:03.488
<v Maddog:>As an example, during COVID, there was

2058
01:34:03.569 --> 01:34:06.094
<v Maddog:>a huge demand for respirators in the

2059
01:34:06.134 --> 01:34:06.374
<v Maddog:>world.

2060
01:34:07.921 --> 01:34:10.164
<v Maddog:>And a respirator used in the university,

2061
01:34:10.324 --> 01:34:11.786
<v Maddog:>used in a hospital to help you

2062
01:34:11.866 --> 01:34:15.291
<v Maddog:>breathe, usually cost between 15 and 30,000

2063
01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:15.331
<v Maddog:>U.S.

2064
01:34:15.351 --> 01:34:15.652
<v Maddog:>dollars.

2065
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.986
<v Maddog:>So we developed a respirator that uses

2066
01:34:22.126 --> 01:34:24.512
<v Maddog:>a Pulga and a Labrador.

2067
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.709
<v Maddog:>It does the same thing for $2,000.

2068
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.682
<v Maddog:>And so instead of buying one $15,000

2069
01:34:32.682 --> 01:34:34.766
<v Maddog:>respirator, you could buy seven $2,000 respirators.

2070
01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.322
<v Maddog:>And that is an example of a

2071
01:34:42.402 --> 01:34:46.811
<v Maddog:>solution that is created using these computers.

2072
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.605
<v Maddog:>And we have other solutions that could

2073
01:34:51.625 --> 01:34:52.026
<v Maddog:>be sold.

2074
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.124
<v Maddog:>You're about to ask me about Project

2075
01:34:57.144 --> 01:34:57.546
<v Maddog:>Calwan.

2076
01:35:01.146 --> 01:35:01.276
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Exactly.

2077
01:35:01.276 --> 01:35:02.871
<v Maddog:>So there's another problem.

2078
01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:08.105
<v Maddog:>Throughout Latin America, federal and state universities,

2079
01:35:08.306 --> 01:35:10.028
<v Maddog:>like in a lot of European countries,

2080
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:13.353
<v Maddog:>federal and state universities are free of

2081
01:35:13.413 --> 01:35:15.696
<v Maddog:>tuition for qualified students.

2082
01:35:16.781 --> 01:35:18.924
<v Maddog:>If you work hard, you study hard

2083
01:35:18.984 --> 01:35:21.187
<v Maddog:>in high school, you pass the entrance

2084
01:35:21.268 --> 01:35:23.912
<v Maddog:>exams, you can get into the university

2085
01:35:24.252 --> 01:35:26.436
<v Maddog:>and you do not pay any tuition.

2086
01:35:27.782 --> 01:35:30.369
<v Maddog:>The problem is you still have fees

2087
01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:31.352
<v Maddog:>and expenses.

2088
01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:34.646
<v Maddog:>So you have to have a room

2089
01:35:34.987 --> 01:35:37.614
<v Maddog:>and food while you're going to university.

2090
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.590
<v Maddog:>You need Internet while you're going to

2091
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:43.188
<v Maddog:>university..You have to buy books when you're

2092
01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:44.132
<v Maddog:>going to university.

2093
01:35:44.132 --> 01:35:46.849
<v Maddog:>You You need to buy computers if

2094
01:35:46.869 --> 01:35:47.933
<v Maddog:>you're going to university.

2095
01:35:48.422 --> 01:35:49.708
<v Maddog:>You need all these things.

2096
01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:52.905
<v Maddog:>And if your family is very poor,

2097
01:35:54.267 --> 01:35:56.191
<v Maddog:>they may not be able to afford

2098
01:35:56.551 --> 01:35:57.613
<v Maddog:>these things for you.

2099
01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:02.204
<v Maddog:>And so 40% of the students who

2100
01:36:02.304 --> 01:36:08.613
<v Maddog:>qualify for a free university education cannot

2101
01:36:08.814 --> 01:36:09.494
<v Maddog:>accept it.

2102
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.542
<v Maddog:>Or if they do, they have to

2103
01:36:12.602 --> 01:36:15.206
<v Maddog:>work these jobs like flipping hamburgers at

2104
01:36:15.226 --> 01:36:17.949
<v Maddog:>McDonald's or being a clerk at a

2105
01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:20.874
<v Maddog:>hotel at night, which do not pay

2106
01:36:20.994 --> 01:36:21.554
<v Maddog:>very much.

2107
01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.007
<v Maddog:>And so I developed this concept of

2108
01:36:28.147 --> 01:36:30.932
<v Maddog:>taking students who may have been using

2109
01:36:30.992 --> 01:36:32.775
<v Maddog:>computers since the age of eight.

2110
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.644
<v Maddog:>They are the people in their family

2111
01:36:35.704 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Maddog:>that everybody comes to when they have

2112
01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:39.674
<v Maddog:>a problem with their computer.

2113
01:36:40.702 --> 01:36:43.672
<v Maddog:>I can't install my application on Android.

2114
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:44.723
<v Maddog:>Can you help me?

2115
01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.447
<v Maddog:>Oh, I can't receive email.

2116
01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.004
<v Maddog:>Can you help me?

2117
01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.507
<v Maddog:>My Wi-Fi isn't working.

2118
01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.391
<v Maddog:>Can you help me?

2119
01:36:54.391 --> 01:36:56.405
<v Maddog:>And these young people will say, sure,

2120
01:36:56.706 --> 01:36:59.231
<v Maddog:>I'll help you because it's family.

2121
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.563
<v Maddog:>But then when they go to get

2122
01:37:02.703 --> 01:37:06.170
<v Maddog:>compensated for their time, they can't ask

2123
01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:08.174
<v Maddog:>their mother to pay them for the

2124
01:37:08.234 --> 01:37:08.515
<v Maddog:>time.

2125
01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:11.187
<v Maddog:>Because it's their mother.

2126
01:37:13.803 --> 01:37:15.228
<v Maddog:>She fed them when they were young.

2127
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.624
<v Maddog:>It's their diaper.

2128
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.526
<v Maddog:>How can you ask your mother to

2129
01:37:19.646 --> 01:37:22.614
<v Maddog:>pay you for your time and expertise?

2130
01:37:23.582 --> 01:37:25.068
<v Maddog:>And the answer is you can't.

2131
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:29.206
<v Maddog:>However, I will teach them that they

2132
01:37:29.287 --> 01:37:32.013
<v Maddog:>can ask a business person for that.

2133
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.906
<v Maddog:>Because a business person needs their computer

2134
01:37:36.648 --> 01:37:38.772
<v Maddog:>and a business person realizes that their

2135
01:37:38.812 --> 01:37:40.134
<v Maddog:>computer isn't working.

2136
01:37:40.135 --> 01:37:42.207
<v Maddog:>It's going to cost them time and

2137
01:37:42.347 --> 01:37:42.567
<v Maddog:>money.

2138
01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:47.668
<v Maddog:>So Project Calwan teaches these young students

2139
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:49.933
<v Maddog:>how to set up their own business.

2140
01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.023
<v Maddog:>And how to take the knowledge that

2141
01:37:53.063 --> 01:37:56.429
<v Maddog:>they already have and sell that to

2142
01:37:56.469 --> 01:37:59.275
<v Maddog:>small business people who need that expertise.

2143
01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:03.405
<v Maddog:>And this will generate enough money doing

2144
01:38:03.565 --> 01:38:08.513
<v Maddog:>part-time work that will pay their expenses

2145
01:38:08.894 --> 01:38:10.257
<v Maddog:>for them to go to university.

2146
01:38:11.762 --> 01:38:17.031
<v Maddog:>And therefore not getting the richest students,

2147
01:38:17.833 --> 01:38:19.696
<v Maddog:>but we're getting the best students.

2148
01:38:21.142 --> 01:38:23.587
<v Maddog:>And it's students who will be doing

2149
01:38:23.687 --> 01:38:26.452
<v Maddog:>work that is related to what they

2150
01:38:26.492 --> 01:38:27.974
<v Maddog:>want to learn in university.

2151
01:38:29.102 --> 01:38:31.448
<v Maddog:>Not flipping hamburgers or being a night

2152
01:38:31.528 --> 01:38:32.771
<v Maddog:>clerk at a hotel.

2153
01:38:35.182 --> 01:38:37.427
<v Maddog:>So currently I am setting up pilots

2154
01:38:37.487 --> 01:38:40.974
<v Maddog:>of this in Argentina, in Brazil.

2155
01:38:42.442 --> 01:38:45.447
<v Maddog:>And once those pilots are successful, which

2156
01:38:45.488 --> 01:38:47.812
<v Maddog:>I'm sure they will be, then we

2157
01:38:48.393 --> 01:38:49.816
<v Maddog:>will open it up to the rest

2158
01:38:49.876 --> 01:38:50.295
<v Maddog:>of the world.

2159
01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:54.673
<v Maddog:>And this project is free of charge

2160
01:38:54.893 --> 01:38:55.575
<v Maddog:>to the students.

2161
01:38:55.575 --> 01:38:58.531
<v Maddog:>They don't pay anything for it, ever.

2162
01:38:59.783 --> 01:39:00.869
<v Maddog:>There's no tricks to it.

2163
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:03.065
<v Maddog:>They'll just be able to find out

2164
01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:05.250
<v Maddog:>how to do this and do it.

2165
01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.762
<v Maddog:>So hopefully we'll be able to generate

2166
01:39:10.283 --> 01:39:15.588
<v Maddog:>one to two million new systems administrators

2167
01:39:16.348 --> 01:39:18.911
<v Maddog:>and programmers using free and open source

2168
01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:21.072
<v Maddog:>software who know how to run their

2169
01:39:21.113 --> 01:39:21.652
<v Maddog:>own business.

2170
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.883
<v Maddog:>So instead of creating one company that

2171
01:39:28.923 --> 01:39:32.047
<v Maddog:>has a million employees, I'm going to

2172
01:39:32.067 --> 01:39:34.570
<v Maddog:>create a million companies that have one

2173
01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:35.210
<v Maddog:>employee.

2174
01:39:40.421 --> 01:39:42.628
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And use open software, of course.

2175
01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:44.724
<v Maddog:>They don't have to.

2176
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.342
<v Maddog:>I mean, if they want to try

2177
01:39:46.402 --> 01:39:48.747
<v Maddog:>and do this stuff with Microsoft or

2178
01:39:48.767 --> 01:39:51.392
<v Maddog:>with Oracle or any closed source proprietary

2179
01:39:51.412 --> 01:39:52.353
<v Maddog:>software, that's fine.

2180
01:39:53.601 --> 01:39:57.166
<v Maddog:>My interest is in getting them to

2181
01:39:58.108 --> 01:40:01.192
<v Maddog:>be able to afford that university education

2182
01:40:01.614 --> 01:40:02.475
<v Maddog:>if they want it.

2183
01:40:03.881 --> 01:40:06.766
<v Maddog:>With LPI, I show them how they

2184
01:40:06.786 --> 01:40:09.932
<v Maddog:>can get an education, can learn on

2185
01:40:09.972 --> 01:40:10.473
<v Maddog:>their own.

2186
01:40:12.562 --> 01:40:14.329
<v Maddog:>And, you know, that's what LPI does.

2187
01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.969
<v Maddog:>But some students don't work that way.

2188
01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.549
<v Maddog:>Some students have to go through the

2189
01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:21.954
<v Maddog:>curriculum of a university.

2190
01:40:22.862 --> 01:40:23.824
<v Maddog:>And I want to be able to

2191
01:40:24.426 --> 01:40:26.070
<v Maddog:>make sure that they can afford to

2192
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:26.471
<v Maddog:>do that.

2193
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.426
<v Maddog:>You know, it's interesting that in Latin

2194
01:40:31.466 --> 01:40:35.533
<v Maddog:>America, oftentimes the oldest child does not

2195
01:40:35.573 --> 01:40:36.435
<v Maddog:>go to university.

2196
01:40:37.501 --> 01:40:39.285
<v Maddog:>Because that child has been working since

2197
01:40:39.305 --> 01:40:41.531
<v Maddog:>the age of 15 to help to

2198
01:40:41.591 --> 01:40:42.634
<v Maddog:>support the family.

2199
01:40:43.761 --> 01:40:47.108
<v Maddog:>So their younger siblings go to university

2200
01:40:47.729 --> 01:40:49.152
<v Maddog:>and the oldest one does not.

2201
01:40:51.261 --> 01:40:53.050
<v Maddog:>There's another interesting thing.

2202
01:40:53.481 --> 01:40:56.728
<v Maddog:>When I went to Cuba, yes, communist

2203
01:40:56.768 --> 01:40:59.232
<v Maddog:>Cuba, horrible communist Cuba.

2204
01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.744
<v Maddog:>If you get into their university for

2205
01:41:02.804 --> 01:41:05.808
<v Maddog:>computer science, not only is your tuition

2206
01:41:05.929 --> 01:41:08.614
<v Maddog:>free, but they provide the room and

2207
01:41:08.734 --> 01:41:10.357
<v Maddog:>board for the students.

2208
01:41:10.763 --> 01:41:12.630
<v Maddog:>They buy the computers needed by the

2209
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:13.072
<v Maddog:>students.

2210
01:41:13.321 --> 01:41:14.768
<v Maddog:>They buy the books needed by the

2211
01:41:14.829 --> 01:41:15.210
<v Maddog:>students.

2212
01:41:16.141 --> 01:41:19.847
<v Maddog:>And under certain circumstances, if they feel

2213
01:41:19.887 --> 01:41:22.030
<v Maddog:>that the family needs the money to

2214
01:41:22.431 --> 01:41:24.234
<v Maddog:>keep going, they will send a small

2215
01:41:24.294 --> 01:41:25.955
<v Maddog:>stipend back to the family.

2216
01:41:26.941 --> 01:41:29.947
<v Maddog:>So the students can be free to

2217
01:41:30.008 --> 01:41:31.851
<v Maddog:>learn at the university.

2218
01:41:35.221 --> 01:41:38.244
<v Maddog:>We can't even get our administrators in

2219
01:41:38.265 --> 01:41:42.830
<v Maddog:>the United States to allow a reasonably

2220
01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:45.393
<v Maddog:>priced college education.

2221
01:41:49.521 --> 01:41:51.565
<v Maddog:>This is what causes the anger in

2222
01:41:51.625 --> 01:41:52.346
<v Maddog:>me to build.

2223
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:02.429
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So if you look retrospectively, your life.

2224
01:42:06.762 --> 01:42:06.862
<v Elisabetta Mori:>One.

2225
01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.150
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What are the achievements in a few

2226
01:42:15.210 --> 01:42:15.470
<v Elisabetta Mori:>words?

2227
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.866
<v Maddog:>The promotion, I think number one would

2228
01:42:20.906 --> 01:42:23.371
<v Maddog:>be the promotion of free and open

2229
01:42:23.391 --> 01:42:24.153
<v Maddog:>source software.

2230
01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.724
<v Maddog:>And I must admit that in the

2231
01:42:26.804 --> 01:42:30.312
<v Maddog:>early days, I tended more with open

2232
01:42:30.373 --> 01:42:30.674
<v Maddog:>source.

2233
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.205
<v Maddog:>I'm one of the people credited with

2234
01:42:33.726 --> 01:42:35.471
<v Maddog:>pointing the term open source.

2235
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.343
<v Maddog:>But over the years, I think more

2236
01:42:39.384 --> 01:42:41.848
<v Maddog:>along the lines of Richard Stallman, that

2237
01:42:41.928 --> 01:42:44.112
<v Maddog:>free software is a better way to

2238
01:42:44.153 --> 01:42:44.313
<v Maddog:>go.

2239
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.406
<v Maddog:>And it's ironic that they call open

2240
01:42:49.446 --> 01:42:51.210
<v Maddog:>source open source licenses.

2241
01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:57.851
<v Maddog:>Not restrictive and the G.

2242
01:42:59.241 --> 01:43:00.184
<v Maddog:>Drift of license.

2243
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:01.583
<v Maddog:>Oh, I'm sorry.

2244
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.746
<v Maddog:>Open source is permissive licenses.

2245
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.190
<v Maddog:>And the GPL is a restrictive license.

2246
01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.382
<v Maddog:>But, you know, I look at the

2247
01:43:11.422 --> 01:43:14.945
<v Maddog:>GPL as being one that frees more

2248
01:43:15.005 --> 01:43:18.188
<v Maddog:>people to be able to have the

2249
01:43:18.228 --> 01:43:22.232
<v Maddog:>needs solved rather than the so-called permissive

2250
01:43:22.312 --> 01:43:26.436
<v Maddog:>licenses of MIT, BSD, and things like

2251
01:43:26.456 --> 01:43:26.676
<v Maddog:>that.

2252
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.591
<v Maddog:>So pushing free software, you're trying to

2253
01:43:32.611 --> 01:43:33.734
<v Maddog:>get more people to use it.

2254
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:34.580
<v Maddog:>That's definitely one.

2255
01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:39.225
<v Maddog:>And secondly, I think teaching at Hartford

2256
01:43:39.245 --> 01:43:41.848
<v Maddog:>State Technical College and later on Merrimack

2257
01:43:41.888 --> 01:43:45.951
<v Maddog:>College and Daniel Webster College was definitely

2258
01:43:46.012 --> 01:43:47.454
<v Maddog:>high points of my life.

2259
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:54.789
<v Maddog:>Then, not necessarily the last, is my

2260
01:43:54.849 --> 01:43:55.571
<v Maddog:>husband Uku.

2261
01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.246
<v Maddog:>And who I love very much.

2262
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:00.285
<v Maddog:>As far as I can tell, he

2263
01:44:00.305 --> 01:44:00.686
<v Maddog:>loves me.

2264
01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.052
<v Maddog:>So that is obviously something.

2265
01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.969
<v Maddog:>And I wish I had met him

2266
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.411
<v Maddog:>earlier.

2267
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:12.048
<v Maddog:>And I wish that I hadn't lived

2268
01:44:12.088 --> 01:44:13.071
<v Maddog:>so many years alone.

2269
01:44:14.341 --> 01:44:16.148
<v Maddog:>But if that had happened, I might

2270
01:44:16.188 --> 01:44:17.232
<v Maddog:>not have traveled as much.

2271
01:44:17.281 --> 01:44:18.606
<v Maddog:>I might not have met as many

2272
01:44:18.666 --> 01:44:18.967
<v Maddog:>people.

2273
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.007
<v Maddog:>So it's always hard to second guess

2274
01:44:24.190 --> 01:44:25.213
<v Maddog:>what your life would have been.

2275
01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:26.963
<v Maddog:>And you can spend the rest of

2276
01:44:26.983 --> 01:44:28.969
<v Maddog:>your life second guessing and saying what

2277
01:44:29.050 --> 01:44:29.110
<v Maddog:>if.

2278
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.186
<v Maddog:>But it does no good because we

2279
01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:32.948
<v Maddog:>are where we are.

2280
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:36.683
<v Maddog:>If I was to have a suggestion

2281
01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:39.629
<v Maddog:>to young people, I would say, save

2282
01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:41.252
<v Maddog:>money.

2283
01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:44.725
<v Maddog:>You know, try to save as much

2284
01:44:44.765 --> 01:44:45.227
<v Maddog:>as you can.

2285
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.545
<v Maddog:>And then as you get older, you'll

2286
01:44:49.585 --> 01:44:51.129
<v Maddog:>have money to do things like take

2287
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:52.432
<v Maddog:>nice trips and stuff like that.

2288
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.689
<v Maddog:>So, you know, I am financially I'm

2289
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:59.834
<v Maddog:>OK, but I'm not Bill Gates.

2290
01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.005
<v Maddog:>And I'm certainly not Elon Musk or

2291
01:45:03.886 --> 01:45:04.767
<v Maddog:>any of those people.

2292
01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.285
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So if you look at the future,

2293
01:45:13.268 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Elisabetta Mori:>what do you think are the biggest

2294
01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.005
<v Elisabetta Mori:>challenges and opportunities for the free and

2295
01:45:19.105 --> 01:45:21.870
<v Elisabetta Mori:>open source software movement in the next

2296
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:23.413
<v Elisabetta Mori:>10 years?

2297
01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.024
<v Maddog:>Well, as I said, I think one

2298
01:45:27.044 --> 01:45:30.911
<v Maddog:>of the biggest opportunities is to take

2299
01:45:30.971 --> 01:45:34.282
<v Maddog:>not only free software, but open hardware

2300
01:45:34.964 --> 01:45:37.651
<v Maddog:>and open culture represented by things like

2301
01:45:37.691 --> 01:45:40.763
<v Maddog:>Creative Commons and putting them together into

2302
01:45:40.823 --> 01:45:44.349
<v Maddog:>solutions that people can not only use

2303
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:46.653
<v Maddog:>but expand to meet their needs.

2304
01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:51.124
<v Maddog:>I can show people where closed source

2305
01:45:51.184 --> 01:45:54.749
<v Maddog:>software is actually limiting in the type

2306
01:45:54.789 --> 01:45:57.854
<v Maddog:>of solutions we can have because they

2307
01:45:57.914 --> 01:46:01.942
<v Maddog:>are not you know, the companies that

2308
01:46:01.963 --> 01:46:03.926
<v Maddog:>control the closed source software do not

2309
01:46:04.026 --> 01:46:07.451
<v Maddog:>see enough of a business opportunity to

2310
01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:08.873
<v Maddog:>implement what people need.

2311
01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.745
<v Maddog:>And this means that some people can't

2312
01:46:13.805 --> 01:46:16.510
<v Maddog:>get the solution that they need to

2313
01:46:16.571 --> 01:46:17.372
<v Maddog:>solve their problem.

2314
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.103
<v Maddog:>But with open source, it puts that

2315
01:46:21.224 --> 01:46:23.468
<v Maddog:>back and free software, it puts that

2316
01:46:23.768 --> 01:46:26.413
<v Maddog:>control back in the hands of the

2317
01:46:26.473 --> 01:46:26.974
<v Maddog:>end user.

2318
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:31.245
<v Maddog:>It becomes the end user's decision where

2319
01:46:31.306 --> 01:46:33.409
<v Maddog:>they spend the money with the time

2320
01:46:33.489 --> 01:46:35.794
<v Maddog:>or the energy to make the change

2321
01:46:35.814 --> 01:46:37.701
<v Maddog:>to the software that gives them a

2322
01:46:37.741 --> 01:46:41.209
<v Maddog:>better solution or do they live with

2323
01:46:41.249 --> 01:46:42.732
<v Maddog:>the solution the way it is?

2324
01:46:44.501 --> 01:46:47.167
<v Maddog:>And the thing is, that's the control

2325
01:46:47.187 --> 01:46:49.192
<v Maddog:>that they have with free software.

2326
01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.686
<v Maddog:>They still may not spend the money.

2327
01:46:51.746 --> 01:46:53.272
<v Maddog:>They still may not have that solution.

2328
01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.486
<v Maddog:>But that's their business decision and not

2329
01:46:56.527 --> 01:46:59.252
<v Maddog:>the business decision of Microsoft or Oracle.

2330
01:47:01.621 --> 01:47:03.083
<v Maddog:>I know that this is not a

2331
01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:08.413
<v Maddog:>very politically correct thing to say in

2332
01:47:08.633 --> 01:47:09.375
<v Maddog:>this day and age.

2333
01:47:10.942 --> 01:47:13.146
<v Maddog:>But I think that people have a

2334
01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:16.193
<v Maddog:>hard time understanding what freedom is.

2335
01:47:17.921 --> 01:47:20.726
<v Maddog:>Certainly, a political party in the United

2336
01:47:20.786 --> 01:47:22.810
<v Maddog:>States is really having a hard time

2337
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:25.214
<v Maddog:>with embracing freedom.

2338
01:47:27.041 --> 01:47:29.987
<v Maddog:>And people have a hard time with

2339
01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:32.612
<v Maddog:>freedom because with freedom, you go about

2340
01:47:32.632 --> 01:47:34.295
<v Maddog:>your life, you say, yes, I'm free,

2341
01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:35.056
<v Maddog:>I'm free, I'm free.

2342
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:36.644
<v Maddog:>But we're not really free.

2343
01:47:37.507 --> 01:47:39.673
<v Maddog:>We're controlled by all sorts of things.

2344
01:47:40.901 --> 01:47:43.826
<v Maddog:>So while people talk about free software,

2345
01:47:44.868 --> 01:47:47.212
<v Maddog:>I instead talk about the opposite, which

2346
01:47:47.292 --> 01:47:48.514
<v Maddog:>is software slavery.

2347
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.568
<v Maddog:>Because people are able to envision what

2348
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:54.671
<v Maddog:>a slave is.

2349
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.162
<v Maddog:>And it's not very nice.

2350
01:47:58.224 --> 01:47:59.787
<v Maddog:>When you're a slave, you're told where

2351
01:47:59.827 --> 01:48:01.831
<v Maddog:>to go, what to do, when to

2352
01:48:01.871 --> 01:48:04.460
<v Maddog:>marry, when to have children, when to

2353
01:48:04.501 --> 01:48:05.503
<v Maddog:>work, when to eat.

2354
01:48:06.004 --> 01:48:06.885
<v Maddog:>You own nothing.

2355
01:48:07.186 --> 01:48:08.589
<v Maddog:>You're in control of nothing.

2356
01:48:08.909 --> 01:48:10.732
<v Maddog:>You are a slave.

2357
01:48:12.681 --> 01:48:15.266
<v Maddog:>And when you're a software slave, you're

2358
01:48:15.306 --> 01:48:17.390
<v Maddog:>told where to buy your software, how

2359
01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:18.452
<v Maddog:>much you're going to pay for it,

2360
01:48:18.573 --> 01:48:19.955
<v Maddog:>what computer system you're going to put

2361
01:48:19.995 --> 01:48:21.824
<v Maddog:>it on, how many people can use

2362
01:48:21.924 --> 01:48:24.549
<v Maddog:>it, when you're going to upgrade, how

2363
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:25.831
<v Maddog:>much you have to pay to maintain

2364
01:48:25.873 --> 01:48:26.955
<v Maddog:>it, so forth and so on.

2365
01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.143
<v Maddog:>And that is software slavery.

2366
01:48:31.907 --> 01:48:38.856
<v Maddog:>And software slavery also precipitates software piracy.

2367
01:48:39.941 --> 01:48:41.965
<v Maddog:>When you can't afford the software, but

2368
01:48:42.005 --> 01:48:43.468
<v Maddog:>you need to have it to do

2369
01:48:43.508 --> 01:48:45.872
<v Maddog:>your business, then you put a patch

2370
01:48:45.932 --> 01:48:48.601
<v Maddog:>in your eye, you go RRR, and

2371
01:48:48.641 --> 01:48:50.847
<v Maddog:>you steal the software because you need

2372
01:48:50.927 --> 01:48:52.590
<v Maddog:>it for your business.

2373
01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.146
<v Maddog:>So software freedom is being able to

2374
01:48:57.247 --> 01:48:59.852
<v Maddog:>pull the software down, change to meet

2375
01:48:59.873 --> 01:49:02.784
<v Maddog:>your needs, and therefore be able to

2376
01:49:03.145 --> 01:49:05.030
<v Maddog:>do what you have to do for

2377
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:06.553
<v Maddog:>your business or your life.

2378
01:49:07.781 --> 01:49:09.925
<v Maddog:>And it becomes you who is in

2379
01:49:09.965 --> 01:49:12.651
<v Maddog:>control, not some company.

2380
01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.422
<v Maddog:>So I realize it's not a very

2381
01:49:17.502 --> 01:49:19.424
<v Maddog:>political thing, and I certainly don't want

2382
01:49:19.465 --> 01:49:22.568
<v Maddog:>to represent the fact that not having

2383
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:26.173
<v Maddog:>my laptop as the equivalent of being

2384
01:49:26.233 --> 01:49:27.855
<v Maddog:>a slave in the 1800s.

2385
01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.105
<v Maddog:>But there's a lot of parallels that

2386
01:49:33.125 --> 01:49:34.207
<v Maddog:>I think need to be said.

2387
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:39.380
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.

2388
01:49:39.821 --> 01:49:41.645
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So is there anything you would like

2389
01:49:41.685 --> 01:49:43.849
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to add that we haven't covered today?

2390
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.724
<v Maddog:>Yeah, I would say, you know, you

2391
01:49:47.825 --> 01:49:49.289
<v Maddog:>asked me about things to look at

2392
01:49:49.429 --> 01:49:50.212
<v Maddog:>in the near future.

2393
01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.924
<v Maddog:>I would say RISC-V technology, which is

2394
01:49:53.944 --> 01:49:56.969
<v Maddog:>a new architecture that's coming out, is

2395
01:49:57.030 --> 01:50:00.195
<v Maddog:>being co-developed by lots of different companies.

2396
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.543
<v Maddog:>It's very, very interesting, and people should

2397
01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:05.807
<v Maddog:>look at that as an alternative to

2398
01:50:06.127 --> 01:50:09.092
<v Maddog:>ARM or Intel or AMD or other

2399
01:50:09.593 --> 01:50:10.273
<v Maddog:>technologies.

2400
01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.551
<v Maddog:>Certainly security is very strong.

2401
01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.923
<v Maddog:>We need to have, you know, because

2402
01:50:17.983 --> 01:50:19.826
<v Maddog:>of the Internet and the number of

2403
01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.250
<v Maddog:>bad people out there, we need to

2404
01:50:22.290 --> 01:50:24.774
<v Maddog:>really work hard to have a secure

2405
01:50:24.854 --> 01:50:25.215
<v Maddog:>system.

2406
01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.625
<v Maddog:>And you need to plan security architected

2407
01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:31.748
<v Maddog:>from the ground up, not just try

2408
01:50:31.768 --> 01:50:33.391
<v Maddog:>and put it on afterwards.

2409
01:50:37.522 --> 01:50:39.510
<v Maddog:>And of course, artificial intelligence.

2410
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.103
<v Maddog:>There's a lot of people who are

2411
01:50:42.143 --> 01:50:46.270
<v Maddog:>worried about chatGPT and open AI as

2412
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:49.395
<v Maddog:>perhaps replacing them as programmers.

2413
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.001
<v Maddog:>And I have no answer for that,

2414
01:50:52.143 --> 01:50:55.647
<v Maddog:>because I do believe that sometime in

2415
01:50:55.668 --> 01:50:58.151
<v Maddog:>the future, we will be able to

2416
01:50:58.211 --> 01:51:01.596
<v Maddog:>have what I call inorganic intelligence.

2417
01:51:02.461 --> 01:51:04.204
<v Maddog:>That will be just as good and

2418
01:51:04.305 --> 01:51:08.374
<v Maddog:>just as strong as organic intelligence.

2419
01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.205
<v Maddog:>But I believe that's a little ways

2420
01:51:12.285 --> 01:51:15.291
<v Maddog:>away, because what we see right now

2421
01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:18.076
<v Maddog:>is not really intelligence.

2422
01:51:19.102 --> 01:51:20.686
<v Maddog:>It is a what they call a

2423
01:51:20.746 --> 01:51:24.255
<v Maddog:>large language module, large language programming.

2424
01:51:25.363 --> 01:51:29.032
<v Maddog:>And it's the same as what the

2425
01:51:29.112 --> 01:51:30.235
<v Maddog:>human mind does.

2426
01:51:31.242 --> 01:51:35.410
<v Maddog:>It's orders of magnitude off in computing

2427
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:37.935
<v Maddog:>power from what the human mind can

2428
01:51:37.975 --> 01:51:38.076
<v Maddog:>do.

2429
01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:43.004
<v Maddog:>So, you know, but the way you

2430
01:51:43.024 --> 01:51:45.326
<v Maddog:>get around that is that you practice

2431
01:51:45.387 --> 01:51:49.270
<v Maddog:>and you learn that when artificial artificial

2432
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:50.972
<v Maddog:>intelligence comes in and does the low

2433
01:51:51.012 --> 01:51:53.733
<v Maddog:>level stuff, you still have a job

2434
01:51:54.415 --> 01:51:55.795
<v Maddog:>of doing the high level stuff.

2435
01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.204
<v Maddog:>You still have a job in teaching

2436
01:51:59.224 --> 01:52:03.772
<v Maddog:>the inorganic intelligence, what to do.

2437
01:52:06.542 --> 01:52:08.429
<v Maddog:>So that's about it, I guess.

2438
01:52:14.022 --> 01:52:18.349
<v Elisabetta Mori:>A quick, quick, quick question that I

2439
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:20.735
<v Elisabetta Mori:>didn't have the chance to ask you

2440
01:52:20.935 --> 01:52:21.236
<v Elisabetta Mori:>earlier.

2441
01:52:22.265 --> 01:52:24.353
<v Elisabetta Mori:>This is my historian.

2442
01:52:24.353 --> 01:52:29.654
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I I mean, my historian's guilt briefly.

2443
01:52:30.922 --> 01:52:33.447
<v Elisabetta Mori:>If you want to say very, very

2444
01:52:33.527 --> 01:52:37.015
<v Elisabetta Mori:>brief, briefly, what are your memories?

2445
01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.485
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Because you said you met them of

2446
01:52:39.706 --> 01:52:41.670
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Grace Hopper and of Morris Wilkes.

2447
01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:46.782
<v Maddog:>Well, both of those people were actually

2448
01:52:46.923 --> 01:52:50.126
<v Maddog:>hired by Digital Equipment Corporation, the company

2449
01:52:50.187 --> 01:52:53.411
<v Maddog:>I worked for, to be ambassadors to

2450
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:55.693
<v Maddog:>go around to universities and give talks

2451
01:52:56.055 --> 01:52:57.056
<v Maddog:>about what they were doing.

2452
01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.882
<v Maddog:>And actually, Grace Mary Hopper was also

2453
01:53:01.102 --> 01:53:02.403
<v Maddog:>used, well, I think both of them

2454
01:53:02.443 --> 01:53:04.565
<v Maddog:>were used as advisors to some of

2455
01:53:04.825 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Maddog:>our, some of our engineers in digital

2456
01:53:10.210 --> 01:53:14.134
<v Maddog:>themselves, because many people think of Grace

2457
01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:16.335
<v Maddog:>Mary Hopper as somebody who went around

2458
01:53:16.516 --> 01:53:19.661
<v Maddog:>and gave nice talks about things like

2459
01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:22.826
<v Maddog:>that, but she was actually a very,

2460
01:53:23.166 --> 01:53:28.055
<v Maddog:>very knowledgeable, brilliant mathematician and logician.

2461
01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:34.587
<v Maddog:>And it's always easier when you are

2462
01:53:34.627 --> 01:53:37.671
<v Maddog:>standing here today and you look back,

2463
01:53:38.252 --> 01:53:40.595
<v Maddog:>you say, of course people understand, of

2464
01:53:40.815 --> 01:53:41.957
<v Maddog:>course it could be done.

2465
01:53:42.481 --> 01:53:44.305
<v Maddog:>But when you're back there and you're

2466
01:53:44.345 --> 01:53:47.012
<v Maddog:>trying to look forward, it's very hard.

2467
01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:51.705
<v Maddog:>And people laughed at Grace Mary Hopper

2468
01:53:51.745 --> 01:53:53.487
<v Maddog:>when she said, I think we can

2469
01:53:53.547 --> 01:53:55.771
<v Maddog:>program computers, not just in the ones

2470
01:53:55.851 --> 01:53:59.957
<v Maddog:>and zeros, but in English like languages.

2471
01:54:00.742 --> 01:54:01.345
<v Maddog:>They laugh.

2472
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.763
<v Maddog:>And then she did a couple of

2473
01:54:04.863 --> 01:54:08.610
<v Maddog:>the simple compilers, Flomatic, and then became

2474
01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:10.572
<v Maddog:>the project lead on Cobalt.

2475
01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.385
<v Maddog:>But beyond that, she was also a

2476
01:54:14.446 --> 01:54:15.670
<v Maddog:>brilliant leader.

2477
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.265
<v Maddog:>And she would take young infants and

2478
01:54:19.325 --> 01:54:21.090
<v Maddog:>try and get them to think outside

2479
01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:21.531
<v Maddog:>the box.

2480
01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.650
<v Maddog:>And I was lucky enough to have

2481
01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:27.492
<v Maddog:>met her at deck.

2482
01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.282
<v Maddog:>And I asked her to come and

2483
01:54:29.363 --> 01:54:32.009
<v Maddog:>talk at Meramec College where I was

2484
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.832
<v Maddog:>teaching that night.

2485
01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.541
<v Maddog:>And she did.

2486
01:54:34.561 --> 01:54:36.867
<v Maddog:>And we went out to dinner together

2487
01:54:36.927 --> 01:54:38.952
<v Maddog:>and she gave everybody nanoseconds and things

2488
01:54:38.992 --> 01:54:39.352
<v Maddog:>like that.

2489
01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.846
<v Maddog:>So she was just a delightful person.

2490
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:44.380
<v Maddog:>Dr.

2491
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:49.830
<v Maddog:>Wilkes Digital had a computer museum in

2492
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:52.555
<v Maddog:>some of its buildings in Marlboro, Massachusetts.

2493
01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.944
<v Maddog:>And it was unusual because they not

2494
01:54:56.004 --> 01:54:59.048
<v Maddog:>only had deck equipment there, but they

2495
01:54:59.128 --> 01:55:01.992
<v Maddog:>also had equipment or pictures of equipment

2496
01:55:02.052 --> 01:55:04.155
<v Maddog:>or things like that of other computer

2497
01:55:04.216 --> 01:55:04.656
<v Maddog:>companies.

2498
01:55:05.601 --> 01:55:06.923
<v Maddog:>They weren't trying to get the image

2499
01:55:06.963 --> 01:55:09.568
<v Maddog:>that it's only deck that had done

2500
01:55:09.609 --> 01:55:11.833
<v Maddog:>this, you know, they gave credit to

2501
01:55:11.893 --> 01:55:12.494
<v Maddog:>other companies.

2502
01:55:13.721 --> 01:55:14.663
<v Maddog:>So I had a young friend of

2503
01:55:14.723 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Maddog:>mine who was studying electrical engineering at

2504
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:19.494
<v Maddog:>a university close to where I was

2505
01:55:19.574 --> 01:55:20.336
<v Maddog:>working and living.

2506
01:55:21.063 --> 01:55:22.647
<v Maddog:>And I said, "Joe, how would you

2507
01:55:22.687 --> 01:55:24.372
<v Maddog:>like to go to this museum on

2508
01:55:24.412 --> 01:55:25.034
<v Maddog:>a Saturday?

2509
01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:28.728
<v Maddog:>You know, we'll go inside and I'll

2510
01:55:28.748 --> 01:55:30.592
<v Maddog:>show you around this equipment because a

2511
01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:31.954
<v Maddog:>lot of this I had worked on."

2512
01:55:33.062 --> 01:55:34.004
<v Maddog:>So he said yes.

2513
01:55:34.344 --> 01:55:35.507
<v Maddog:>He was about I guess he was

2514
01:55:35.507 --> 01:55:36.969
<v Maddog:>about 21 at the time and I

2515
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:38.131
<v Maddog:>was probably about 35.

2516
01:55:40.622 --> 01:55:42.289
<v Maddog:>We show up t-shirts and shorts.

2517
01:55:42.369 --> 01:55:43.353
<v Maddog:>It's a hot summer day.

2518
01:55:43.842 --> 01:55:45.607
<v Maddog:>We signed in and we're assigned a

2519
01:55:45.667 --> 01:55:47.573
<v Maddog:>guide to take us around.

2520
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:49.863
<v Maddog:>And he was a funny little old

2521
01:55:49.923 --> 01:55:52.207
<v Maddog:>man and he had a suit and

2522
01:55:52.227 --> 01:55:54.091
<v Maddog:>a white shirt and a top over

2523
01:55:54.111 --> 01:55:56.816
<v Maddog:>the summer and work glasses.

2524
01:55:58.123 --> 01:56:00.750
<v Maddog:>And he was kind of chubby and

2525
01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:02.636
<v Maddog:>he started taking us around.

2526
01:56:02.636 --> 01:56:04.527
<v Maddog:>And he was a great guide because

2527
01:56:04.707 --> 01:56:06.813
<v Maddog:>he would talk as if he knew

2528
01:56:06.994 --> 01:56:07.816
<v Maddog:>all these people.

2529
01:56:07.816 --> 01:56:09.909
<v Maddog:>He had actually worked on these projects

2530
01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:11.515
<v Maddog:>and these were great friends.

2531
01:56:11.515 --> 01:56:13.027
<v Maddog:>He'd gone out to beer with them

2532
01:56:13.088 --> 01:56:13.570
<v Maddog:>and stuff.

2533
01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:14.353
<v Maddog:>He'd tell us stuff.

2534
01:56:14.922 --> 01:56:16.868
<v Maddog:>And Joe and I just kept laughing

2535
01:56:17.048 --> 01:56:18.954
<v Maddog:>about this because, no, this is a

2536
01:56:19.014 --> 01:56:19.656
<v Maddog:>great guide.

2537
01:56:19.702 --> 01:56:22.112
<v Maddog:>He made it seem personal and everything.

2538
01:56:23.204 --> 01:56:24.508
<v Maddog:>And we get in front of this

2539
01:56:24.608 --> 01:56:25.953
<v Maddog:>huge picture on the wall.

2540
01:56:26.921 --> 01:56:29.165
<v Maddog:>It shows this young man, maybe in

2541
01:56:29.225 --> 01:56:33.954
<v Maddog:>his early 20s, screwing together aluminum pipes

2542
01:56:34.335 --> 01:56:36.905
<v Maddog:>that are going to hold mercury, which

2543
01:56:36.965 --> 01:56:38.449
<v Maddog:>is going to be the memory of

2544
01:56:38.489 --> 01:56:40.715
<v Maddog:>this first stored program computer.

2545
01:56:41.646 --> 01:56:43.574
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Yes, the mercury delay lines.

2546
01:56:44.102 --> 01:56:45.605
<v Maddog:>Yes, exactly.

2547
01:56:46.828 --> 01:56:49.815
<v Maddog:>And the voice behind us says, yes,

2548
01:56:50.396 --> 01:56:50.877
<v Maddog:>there I am.

2549
01:56:51.303 --> 01:56:51.905
<v Maddog:>That's me.

2550
01:56:52.928 --> 01:56:54.251
<v Maddog:>And Joe and I look down at

2551
01:56:54.292 --> 01:56:55.375
<v Maddog:>the corner and it says, Dr.

2552
01:56:56.325 --> 01:56:58.955
<v Maddog:>Maurice Wilkes, head of the EDZAC project.

2553
01:56:58.955 --> 01:57:02.269
<v Maddog:>And we turn around and his pin

2554
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:03.973
<v Maddog:>says, Maurice Wilkes.

2555
01:57:05.321 --> 01:57:06.765
<v Maddog:>And I go, oh, my God, oh,

2556
01:57:07.508 --> 01:57:08.872
<v Maddog:>my God, oh, my God, Dr.

2557
01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:12.807
<v Maddog:>Wilkes, please, please come to my university,

2558
01:57:13.048 --> 01:57:14.751
<v Maddog:>come to my college and give a

2559
01:57:14.811 --> 01:57:16.454
<v Maddog:>talk about anything you want to.

2560
01:57:17.823 --> 01:57:19.409
<v Maddog:>So he graciously accepted.

2561
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.007
<v Maddog:>We gave a great talk, you know,

2562
01:57:23.027 --> 01:57:24.631
<v Maddog:>of the work he was still doing

2563
01:57:24.852 --> 01:57:25.413
<v Maddog:>at that age.

2564
01:57:26.681 --> 01:57:30.907
<v Maddog:>And we went out to dinner and

2565
01:57:30.928 --> 01:57:33.130
<v Maddog:>I gave him four wine glasses with

2566
01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:35.535
<v Maddog:>the university's name engraved into them.

2567
01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.765
<v Maddog:>And he almost broke into tears because

2568
01:57:39.626 --> 01:57:41.069
<v Maddog:>all of his wine glasses have been

2569
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:43.452
<v Maddog:>broken on the trip from England to

2570
01:57:43.473 --> 01:57:44.275
<v Maddog:>the United States.

2571
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.244
<v Maddog:>And he and his wife had no

2572
01:57:46.324 --> 01:57:48.070
<v Maddog:>wine glasses to use for their wine.

2573
01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:51.026
<v Maddog:>So he was he was grateful for

2574
01:57:51.066 --> 01:57:51.206
<v Maddog:>that.

2575
01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.688
<v Maddog:>Now, that was the end with Dr.

2576
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:55.841
<v Maddog:>Wilkes for a while.

2577
01:57:56.842 --> 01:57:59.266
<v Maddog:>But then many years later, a friend

2578
01:57:59.306 --> 01:58:00.688
<v Maddog:>of mine who had worked on the

2579
01:58:00.828 --> 01:58:03.152
<v Maddog:>Alpha Linux project, he had done the

2580
01:58:03.212 --> 01:58:05.516
<v Maddog:>boot later called boot loader called Milo.

2581
01:58:06.622 --> 01:58:07.927
<v Maddog:>This name is David Rustling.

2582
01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.303
<v Maddog:>And David Rustling left deck, went on

2583
01:58:12.403 --> 01:58:14.746
<v Maddog:>to work for Arm, became an arm

2584
01:58:14.906 --> 01:58:20.532
<v Maddog:>fellow, then started a organization called Linaro

2585
01:58:20.933 --> 01:58:23.275
<v Maddog:>that helps to put Linux on arm

2586
01:58:23.315 --> 01:58:23.776
<v Maddog:>products.

2587
01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:27.046
<v Maddog:>He was a chief technical officer of

2588
01:58:27.086 --> 01:58:27.267
<v Maddog:>that.

2589
01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.324
<v Maddog:>One day, Dave was asked to go

2590
01:58:31.344 --> 01:58:34.069
<v Maddog:>to the University of Cambridge and give

2591
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:36.353
<v Maddog:>a talk about Linux and open source

2592
01:58:36.393 --> 01:58:38.076
<v Maddog:>software and everything about that.

2593
01:58:38.076 --> 01:58:38.964
<v Maddog:>He does that.

2594
01:58:40.301 --> 01:58:41.487
<v Maddog:>He's given a talk.

2595
01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.625
<v Maddog:>And this is old man in the

2596
01:58:44.685 --> 01:58:47.751
<v Maddog:>front row with all white hair asking

2597
01:58:47.832 --> 01:58:48.374
<v Maddog:>questions.

2598
01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.570
<v Maddog:>And David is answering these questions.

2599
01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.443
<v Maddog:>As the talk is over and everybody's

2600
01:58:54.524 --> 01:58:56.647
<v Maddog:>walking out, Dave turns to one of

2601
01:58:56.667 --> 01:58:57.929
<v Maddog:>the people on the stage and says,

2602
01:58:57.929 --> 01:59:01.094
<v Maddog:>"Who is that old man asking those

2603
01:59:01.095 --> 01:59:04.010
<v Maddog:>questions?" And says, "oh, that's Dr.

2604
01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:07.492
<v Maddog:>Wilkes." And Dave goes, "Oh, my God.

2605
01:59:07.492 --> 01:59:07.522
<v Maddog:>Oh, my God.

2606
01:59:07.522 --> 01:59:07.542
<v Maddog:>my God.

2607
01:59:07.542 --> 01:59:07.572
<v Maddog:>Oh, my God.

2608
01:59:10.862 --> 01:59:13.209
<v Maddog:>I've been presenting about Linux in front

2609
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.752
<v Maddog:>of Dr.

2610
01:59:13.752 --> 01:59:19.105
<v Maddog:>Wilkes." So these are the types of

2611
01:59:19.165 --> 01:59:20.888
<v Maddog:>people that I've been lucky enough to

2612
01:59:20.948 --> 01:59:24.454
<v Maddog:>meet over the years and people who

2613
01:59:24.474 --> 01:59:25.736
<v Maddog:>I greatly respect.

2614
01:59:26.823 --> 01:59:28.991
<v Maddog:>And unfortunately, Dr.

2615
01:59:29.402 --> 01:59:30.869
<v Maddog:>Wilkes is dead.

2616
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.266
<v Maddog:>And so is Dr.

2617
01:59:33.261 --> 01:59:33.583
<v Maddog:>Hopper.

2618
01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:38.124
<v Maddog:>But I still talk about them and

2619
01:59:38.164 --> 01:59:40.786
<v Maddog:>from time to time dedicate my talks

2620
01:59:41.348 --> 01:59:43.891
