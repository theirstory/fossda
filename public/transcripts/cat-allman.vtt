00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Welcome to FOSSDA, the Free and Open

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Source Stories Digital Archive Foundation.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It's the 25th of July, 2023, and

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I am Elisabetta Mori, an historian of

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Computing currently based in Italy, and an

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>oral history interview with FOSSDA.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.801
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Today I'll be talking to Cat Allman.

8
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Cat has been involved in open source

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Elisabetta Mori:>software since the 1980s and worked with

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the global free and open source software

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Elisabetta Mori:>community at Google.

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Elisabetta Mori:>We are recording on theirstory.io and I

13
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>am in Rio, Elba Island, Italy, and

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Cat is in San Francisco, US.

15
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Welcome, Cat.

16
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you for being here today.

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you talk about your childhood?

18
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Cat Allman:>Sure.

19
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Cat Allman:>I was born in Oakland, in Oakland,

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Cat Allman:>California, in 1958, and raised in the

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Cat Allman:>East Bay Hills, looking out across San

22
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Cat Allman:>Francisco Bay to the Golden Gate Bridge

23
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Cat Allman:>in San Francisco with my older brother

24
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.399
<v Cat Allman:>Eric Allman, creator, original creator of Send

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Cat Allman:>Mail, the mail transfer agent.

26
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Cat Allman:>Went to public schools, ending up at

27
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Cat Allman:>University of California, Santa Cruz, where I

28
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Cat Allman:>studied American Studies, so not engineering, not

29
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Cat Allman:>computer science.

30
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Cat Allman:>Growing up with an older brother who

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Cat Allman:>was a science child prodigy put me

32
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Cat Allman:>on another path for a while, though

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Cat Allman:>because of his interests we grew up

34
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Cat Allman:>with like boxes of punch cards, which

35
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Cat Allman:>it turns out if you make a

36
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Cat Allman:>cone out of them and staple them

37
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Cat Allman:>and spray paint them gold, you can

38
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Cat Allman:>make a Christmas wreath out of them,

39
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Cat Allman:>which we did do because super nerdy,

40
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Cat Allman:>what can I say?

41
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Cat Allman:>Fast forward to out of school looking

42
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Cat Allman:>for a job and that was the

43
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Cat Allman:>early 1980s and computers were just coming

44
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Cat Allman:>online as business tools.

45
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Cat Allman:>It was right before personal computers, so

46
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.059
<v Cat Allman:>many computers were the rage and I

47
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Cat Allman:>was working for a advertising media planning

48
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Cat Allman:>firm that not only specialized in technology

49
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Cat Allman:>clients, but was one of the first

50
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Cat Allman:>to have a computerized, essentially, work tracking

51
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Cat Allman:>system.

52
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Cat Allman:>So whether I wanted to or not,

53
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Cat Allman:>there I was working with computers.

54
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.799
<v Cat Allman:>In the meantime, I was close as

55
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Cat Allman:>I always have been with my brother

56
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Cat Allman:>and his group of friends.

57
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Cat Allman:>Fast forward a little bit and my

58
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Cat Allman:>first job with free and open source

59
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Cat Allman:>software was at Mount Zainu.

60
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Cat Allman:>Mount Zainu is Unix trademark backwards.

61
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Cat Allman:>Our logo was a little mountain range.

62
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Cat Allman:>I was a contractor, not an employee,

63
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.700
<v Cat Allman:>but so I was working on coordinating

64
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Cat Allman:>the company's involvement with DECUS, which was

65
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Cat Allman:>the DEC User Group Conference.

66
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Cat Allman:>And found myself really kind of engaged

67
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.720
<v Cat Allman:>with the political idea of software that

68
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.859
<v Cat Allman:>had been created at a publicly funded

69
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Cat Allman:>institution as being free and available to

70
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Cat Allman:>the rest of us to use.

71
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Cat Allman:>Really the academic method of, you know,

72
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Cat Allman:>you come up with an idea and

73
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Cat Allman:>other people build on it and civilization

74
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Cat Allman:>rolls along.

75
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Cat Allman:>There's a lot more history behind that,

76
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Cat Allman:>including a protracted intellectual property lawsuit between

77
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Cat Allman:>AT&T and the University of California, because

78
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Cat Allman:>Mount Zainu was selling the first commercially

79
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.620
<v Cat Allman:>supported release of what is now known

80
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Cat Allman:>as Berkeley Unix.

81
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.600
<v Cat Allman:>But the other thing that happened, that

82
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Cat Allman:>was a collective.

83
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.960
<v Cat Allman:>So every Wednesday, we gathered in the

84
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.980
<v Cat Allman:>conference room and argued every decision to

85
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.640
<v Cat Allman:>a halt.

86
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.200
<v Cat Allman:>And there was the one guy who

87
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Cat Allman:>gave up last, so he usually got

88
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Cat Allman:>his way.

89
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Cat Allman:>And then we had burritos, because it

90
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.360
<v Cat Allman:>was California.

91
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Cat Allman:>But I was a contractor, so then

92
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Cat Allman:>I was out of work again and

93
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Cat Allman:>ended up working at Axion Design.

94
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.859
<v Cat Allman:>At the time it was called DeVito

95
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.479
<v Cat Allman:>and Associates and it was one of

96
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.560
<v Cat Allman:>the most prominent package design and branding

97
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Cat Allman:>firms in the United States.

98
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Cat Allman:>And it was all done on paper.

99
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Cat Allman:>I was running a darkroom and literally

100
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Cat Allman:>mixing bottles of ink to make custom

101
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Cat Allman:>materials for the artists to make mock-ups

102
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Cat Allman:>of package designs.

103
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Cat Allman:>But right about that time, computers started

104
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Cat Allman:>coming along in the design industry.

105
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Cat Allman:>And I already had experience using a

106
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Cat Allman:>computer which no one except the COO

107
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Cat Allman:>had and so we started expanding the

108
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Cat Allman:>offerings, the internal offerings to include computers

109
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.679
<v Cat Allman:>not free and open source software but

110
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Cat Allman:>software.

111
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Cat Allman:>That rolled along, ended up being an

112
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Cat Allman:>IT manager back in the days when

113
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Cat Allman:>you could actually make a profit by

114
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Cat Allman:>selling computer services.

115
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.559
<v Cat Allman:>Now it would be like having pay

116
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Cat Allman:>toilets, but at the time you could

117
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Cat Allman:>charge by, I think we charged on

118
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Cat Allman:>five minute increments for the designers using

119
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Cat Allman:>the computers that I bought and managed

120
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Cat Allman:>to do graphic design work.

121
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.012
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Do you remember computers were at the

122
00:05:49.012 --> 00:05:49.028
<v Elisabetta Mori:>time?

123
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Cat Allman:>Originally we just had one Microsoft AT,

124
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Cat Allman:>PC AT.

125
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Cat Allman:>It was actually pre-Windows, So it was

126
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.860
<v Cat Allman:>command line, but just barely.

127
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.099
<v Cat Allman:>And then the Macintosh came along and

128
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.400
<v Cat Allman:>we started right about the time you

129
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Cat Allman:>started having color available on the Macintosh.

130
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Cat Allman:>A friend had lent me the original

131
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.180
<v Cat Allman:>Macintosh.

132
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Cat Allman:>So early on, I was able to

133
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.940
<v Cat Allman:>connect to a deck of backs at

134
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.320
<v Cat Allman:>the University of California to send email

135
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.940
<v Cat Allman:>back and forth with my friends.

136
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Cat Allman:>Kind of open source.

137
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Cat Allman:>I should mention all this predates the

138
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.080
<v Cat Allman:>development of the term free software as

139
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Cat Allman:>popularized by Richard Stallman, or open source.

140
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Cat Allman:>The term open source came later in

141
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Cat Allman:>the late 1990s.

142
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Cat Allman:>So, looping that all together, how did

143
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Cat Allman:>I get started actually in free and

144
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Cat Allman:>open source software?

145
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Cat Allman:>I was sick of my job, but

146
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Cat Allman:>I liked engineers.

147
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Cat Allman:>I really admired not just the way

148
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.800
<v Cat Allman:>my brother and his friends organized the

149
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.920
<v Cat Allman:>world, but the people I met through

150
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Cat Allman:>the software industry in the graphic design

151
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Cat Allman:>field actually tried to put together a

152
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Cat Allman:>community in the San Francisco Bay Area

153
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Cat Allman:>for people doing IT management for advertising

154
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Cat Allman:>and graphic design.

155
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Cat Allman:>It didn't really go anywhere but it

156
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Cat Allman:>was interesting to try.

157
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Cat Allman:>So about this time the idea of

158
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Cat Allman:>businesses based on free and open source

159
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Cat Allman:>software started percolating around.

160
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.480
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, there'd been, what were they

161
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Cat Allman:>called?

162
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Cat Allman:>There had been an earlier company doing

163
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Cat Allman:>BSD, CD ROMs, etc.

164
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Cat Allman:>I'm embarrassed I can't remember their name,

165
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Cat Allman:>but anyway, they were there.

166
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Cat Allman:>So my brother around that time, that

167
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Cat Allman:>would be 1997, had a former colleague

168
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.060
<v Cat Allman:>who they were talking together about doing

169
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.239
<v Cat Allman:>something with Sendmail in terms of starting

170
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.640
<v Cat Allman:>a business around it.

171
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.220
<v Cat Allman:>My brother wouldn't hire me because nepotism,

172
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.060
<v Cat Allman:>he's a very principled guy, so I

173
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Cat Allman:>started harassing his business partner to give

174
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Cat Allman:>me a job as they were putting

175
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Cat Allman:>this idea of a company together.

176
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Cat Allman:>And he finally gave up and hired

177
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.620
<v Cat Allman:>me.

178
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Cat Allman:>So I was employee number five at

179
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Cat Allman:>Sendmail Inc.

180
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Cat Allman:>And was there when we launched the

181
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.580
<v Cat Allman:>company, which I look back on it,

182
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.079
<v Cat Allman:>and it was kind of embarrassing, some

183
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.000
<v Cat Allman:>of the choices I had made, but

184
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.620
<v Cat Allman:>it was a really heady time.

185
00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Cat Allman:>At that point, we were going to

186
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Cat Allman:>ISP-focused conferences, as that was really a

187
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.440
<v Cat Allman:>stronghold for the use of free and

188
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Cat Allman:>open source software, was the ISP business,

189
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Cat Allman:>back when people could start a local

190
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.780
<v Cat Allman:>ISP and actually end up making money.

191
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.199
<v Cat Allman:>It didn't last long, but it was

192
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Cat Allman:>kind of glorious while it lasted.

193
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Cat Allman:>And then about that same time, 1998,

194
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Cat Allman:>I think, yes, I have the t-shirt.

195
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Cat Allman:>O'Reilly and Company, the media people, the

196
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.540
<v Cat Allman:>animal books, did a, as I recall

197
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.900
<v Cat Allman:>it, it was an evening event at

198
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.680
<v Cat Allman:>a conference room at Stanford University about

199
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.240
<v Cat Allman:>free and open source software.

200
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.020
<v Cat Allman:>I should have brought the t-shirt to

201
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.560
<v Cat Allman:>the interview.

202
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Cat Allman:>And we were there for that.

203
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Cat Allman:>And suddenly the world was in a

204
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.580
<v Cat Allman:>dot-com bubble, and not just a dot-com

205
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.060
<v Cat Allman:>bubble, but a hybrid business model, open

206
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Cat Allman:>source software bubble.

207
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.939
<v Cat Allman:>We actually got landed on the front

208
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.540
<v Cat Allman:>page of the New York Times when

209
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Cat Allman:>we launched the company, which was pretty

210
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Cat Allman:>heady for the five of us, but

211
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.540
<v Cat Allman:>the technology reporter at the time understood

212
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Cat Allman:>the importance of what Sendmail has done

213
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.760
<v Cat Allman:>to actually create the Internet.

214
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.740
<v Cat Allman:>And also by that time, Tim Berners-Lee

215
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Cat Allman:>had invented the World Wide Web.

216
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Cat Allman:>It's funny looking back on, I remember

217
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Cat Allman:>bringing my original Macintosh to my office

218
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Cat Allman:>and showing my boss email and he

219
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.439
<v Cat Allman:>was like, why would anybody want to

220
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.180
<v Cat Allman:>use this?

221
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Cat Allman:>And then some years later we brought

222
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Cat Allman:>a color Macintosh in and showed him

223
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Cat Allman:>the World Wide Web and he was

224
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Cat Allman:>like, why would anyone care?

225
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Cat Allman:>Well, needless to say, 30, 40 years,

226
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.020
<v Cat Allman:>things are a little different.

227
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Cat Allman:>And I think, you know, for the

228
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.320
<v Cat Allman:>regular user, they don't necessarily understand or

229
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Cat Allman:>need to understand how important floss has

230
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.980
<v Cat Allman:>been to the development of the Internet

231
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.220
<v Cat Allman:>and the World Wide Web.

232
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Cat Allman:>But as I said to a fellow

233
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.300
<v Cat Allman:>panelist actually at Maker Faire Rome, a

234
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Cat Allman:>banking guy who was saying, "oh, we

235
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.220
<v Cat Allman:>don't use any open source software in

236
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.100
<v Cat Allman:>my Italian bank." And I'm like, "do

237
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.795
<v Cat Allman:>you send email to clients bank online?"

238
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Cat Allman:>He's like, "well, yeah." I'm like, "you

239
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.959
<v Cat Allman:>look, you're using free and open source

240
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.800
<v Cat Allman:>software." And the look of horror on

241
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Cat Allman:>the poor man's face was really fun.

242
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Cat Allman:>But anyway, so that was interesting being

243
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Cat Allman:>in the dot-com bubble.

244
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.160
<v Cat Allman:>Heady times, stupid parties.

245
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.240
<v Cat Allman:>But what was really important for the

246
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.040
<v Cat Allman:>development of my engagement was, I mean,

247
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Cat Allman:>I started out as the marketing manager,

248
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.280
<v Cat Allman:>but as we grew, I did not

249
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Cat Allman:>maintain that title, but I was the

250
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.360
<v Cat Allman:>one that got all the email coming

251
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.720
<v Cat Allman:>into info at and sorted it out

252
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.699
<v Cat Allman:>and answered a lot of questions and

253
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Cat Allman:>redirected people where they needed to go.

254
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Cat Allman:>Now that was mail coming into the

255
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.660
<v Cat Allman:>company as a hybrid business model, we

256
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Cat Allman:>had Sendmail the projects and mail.org and

257
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Cat Allman:>Sendmail.com the company.

258
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Cat Allman:>So I was dealing with the company

259
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.948
<v Cat Allman:>email and it was it was interesting

260
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:19.163
<v Cat Allman:>times.

261
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.840
<v Cat Allman:>People are very passionate about software that

262
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Cat Allman:>they work on.

263
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.920
<v Cat Allman:>And Frankly, that passion is a big

264
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Cat Allman:>part of why I've stayed involved with

265
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.000
<v Cat Allman:>free and open source software over the

266
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.500
<v Cat Allman:>decades.

267
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.199
<v Cat Allman:>I never want to be in one

268
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.480
<v Cat Allman:>of those jobs where people don't care.

269
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Cat Allman:>And so far, at least, people involved

270
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Cat Allman:>with free and open source really care.

271
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.699
<v Cat Allman:>And that means, I mean, life is

272
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.860
<v Cat Allman:>short and you don't have time at

273
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.320
<v Cat Allman:>work.

274
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.480
<v Cat Allman:>So you might as well spend it

275
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.180
<v Cat Allman:>with people.

276
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Cat Allman:>Even if you don't always agree with

277
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.960
<v Cat Allman:>them, you respect their commitment to their

278
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.460
<v Cat Allman:>ideas.

279
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.920
<v Cat Allman:>So here I am.

280
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Cat Allman:>Plus, I like solving problems and free

281
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.680
<v Cat Allman:>software, open source software, it's all about

282
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.420
<v Cat Allman:>solving problems and working collectively to make

283
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Cat Allman:>things better for all of us.

284
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Cat Allman:>Sometimes not so much together.

285
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Cat Allman:>There's the XKCD comic of the enormous

286
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Cat Allman:>infrastructure that holds up the world and

287
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.960
<v Cat Allman:>there's one little block at the bottom

288
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Cat Allman:>maintained by one guy.

289
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Cat Allman:>But that's another interesting thing is the

290
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Cat Allman:>sustainability of free and open source software

291
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Cat Allman:>as it is increasingly relied upon by

292
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Cat Allman:>the world, really the global infrastructure of

293
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:43.920
<v Cat Allman:>information.

294
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Cat Allman:>So fast forward, I worked at Send

295
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Cat Allman:>Mail for about four years and I

296
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.940
<v Cat Allman:>took some time off and the USENIX

297
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Cat Allman:>Association is something that I had known

298
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Cat Allman:>for a long time.

299
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Cat Allman:>When I was an IT manager I

300
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.220
<v Cat Allman:>went to their conferences focused on IT

301
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Cat Allman:>services and I knew the executive director

302
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.380
<v Cat Allman:>and people involved.

303
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.120
<v Cat Allman:>My brother and my brother-in-law had been

304
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Cat Allman:>involved.

305
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.180
<v Cat Allman:>So when the executive director called me

306
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Cat Allman:>and asked me to come in and

307
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Cat Allman:>do what amounted to fundraising, marketing and

308
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.240
<v Cat Allman:>fundraising for them, I was ready for

309
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.100
<v Cat Allman:>another job.

310
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.460
<v Cat Allman:>So I worked there for years.

311
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Cat Allman:>But one of our sponsors, I was

312
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.620
<v Cat Allman:>about to call them a client because

313
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.780
<v Cat Allman:>they were kind of a client, was

314
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Cat Allman:>Google, early Google.

315
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.599
<v Cat Allman:>And my brother had told me about

316
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Cat Allman:>this cool new search engine in 1999

317
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.579
<v Cat Allman:>I think and then I remember really

318
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Cat Allman:>wanting a Gmail email address even though

319
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.699
<v Cat Allman:>a friend was running my own domain

320
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Cat Allman:>for me.

321
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.700
<v Cat Allman:>So Google recruiting had booths and advertisements

322
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Cat Allman:>on the Unix platform, Usenix platform.

323
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.700
<v Cat Allman:>I'll be careful to pronounce that right.

324
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Cat Allman:>So I knew some people there.

325
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Cat Allman:>And then someone I knew from the

326
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.280
<v Cat Allman:>dot com bubble when he was at

327
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.740
<v Cat Allman:>VA Linux was now the head of

328
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.820
<v Cat Allman:>Google's OSPO.

329
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.460
<v Cat Allman:>People argue whether Google had the first

330
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Cat Allman:>OSPO or whether Sun Microsystems did.

331
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Cat Allman:>I don't know that it really matters,

332
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.600
<v Cat Allman:>but if you want to have a

333
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Cat Allman:>heated conversation in a bar late at

334
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Cat Allman:>night, at certain circumstances, you can bring

335
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.800
<v Cat Allman:>that up.

336
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.439
<v Cat Allman:>So, actually the first job I applied

337
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.280
<v Cat Allman:>to at Google they wouldn't even talk

338
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.640
<v Cat Allman:>to me which was disappointing, but c'est

339
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.060
<v Cat Allman:>la vie.

340
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.320
<v Cat Allman:>But then I saw Chris DeBona at

341
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Cat Allman:>an open source conference and one of

342
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.500
<v Cat Allman:>the people working at Google had made

343
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.100
<v Cat Allman:>a unfortunate error in something they were

344
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Cat Allman:>doing and I had been able to

345
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.480
<v Cat Allman:>correct it for them before it got

346
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Cat Allman:>bad.

347
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Cat Allman:>So I was aware that there might

348
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Cat Allman:>be a need there for help with

349
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.720
<v Cat Allman:>working with the free and open source

350
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Cat Allman:>software community.

351
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.720
<v Cat Allman:>So I saw Chris and I'm like,

352
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Cat Allman:>"hey, Chris, need any help?" And he

353
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.860
<v Cat Allman:>said, "Yeah, why don't you apply?" So

354
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.080
<v Cat Allman:>you asked me about interviews, it took

355
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.260
<v Cat Allman:>four months.

356
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Cat Allman:>And three rounds of interviews, I think

357
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Cat Allman:>I interviewed with eight people.

358
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.080
<v Cat Allman:>And my recruiter was funny after I

359
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Cat Allman:>was hired.

360
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.240
<v Cat Allman:>She said, "you know, Google staffing didn't

361
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.520
<v Cat Allman:>even want to give you a phone

362
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Cat Allman:>screen." I'm like, okay.

363
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Cat Allman:>But the free and open source software

364
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Cat Allman:>community takes care of its own, if

365
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.040
<v Cat Allman:>you will.

366
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.320
<v Cat Allman:>Not only Chris went and said, "no,

367
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.339
<v Cat Allman:>really, you have to hire her", but

368
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.260
<v Cat Allman:>a gentleman named Rob Pike, who had

369
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Cat Allman:>been involved with the Unix operating system

370
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.720
<v Cat Allman:>since the 1980s, and more recently was

371
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Cat Allman:>the original creator of the Go system.

372
00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.379
<v Cat Allman:>When you apply to Google, at least

373
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Cat Allman:>it used to be, they would send

374
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.880
<v Cat Allman:>an email around internally saying, do you

375
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.839
<v Cat Allman:>know this person?

376
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.020
<v Cat Allman:>Because you have to put a list

377
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.720
<v Cat Allman:>of people you know working at Google

378
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.619
<v Cat Allman:>on your application.

379
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Cat Allman:>So Rob said something really nice for

380
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.140
<v Cat Allman:>me.

381
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.720
<v Cat Allman:>And since Rob had been at Bell

382
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.360
<v Cat Allman:>Labs and was generally very well respected,

383
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.440
<v Cat Allman:>I told him I'd make him some

384
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.360
<v Cat Allman:>brownies and he's like, no, it's my

385
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.860
<v Cat Allman:>job.

386
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.980
<v Cat Allman:>Rob's kind of like that.

387
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Cat Allman:>So they eventually broke down and hired

388
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.140
<v Cat Allman:>me.

389
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:49.460
<v Cat Allman:>And yeah, it was very exciting to

390
00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.260
<v Cat Allman:>try working at a big company.

391
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.200
<v Cat Allman:>I have to say my first day

392
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.160
<v Cat Allman:>was spent in a windowless room in

393
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.040
<v Cat Allman:>a group for an orientation with all

394
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Cat Allman:>these extraordinarily perky videos.

395
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.040
<v Cat Allman:>And I went home in tears because

396
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Cat Allman:>I thought oh my god I've made

397
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Cat Allman:>a terrible mistake.

398
00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.719
<v Cat Allman:>But unlike most people at least at

399
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.100
<v Cat Allman:>the time who applied to Google I

400
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.900
<v Cat Allman:>went into it knowing who I was

401
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Cat Allman:>going to work for and what I

402
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.140
<v Cat Allman:>was going to work on.

403
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Cat Allman:>I didn't go to work at Google,

404
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.100
<v Cat Allman:>I went to work on free and

405
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Cat Allman:>open source software at Google.

406
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.220
<v Cat Allman:>So that's what I did.

407
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.620
<v Cat Allman:>It's part of the outreach team.

408
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Cat Allman:>So we did things like, Google Summer

409
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.900
<v Cat Allman:>of Code came from there, as well

410
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Cat Allman:>as Google Code-In, which was a program

411
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.379
<v Cat Allman:>like Google Summer of Code, but for

412
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Cat Allman:>teenagers, which was actually even more inspiring,

413
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Cat Allman:>I think, than Google Summer of Code.

414
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Cat Allman:>I should mention in case it's not

415
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Cat Allman:>clear, Google Summer of Code is a

416
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.380
<v Cat Allman:>program that Google has been running since

417
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.900
<v Cat Allman:>2005, where they work, open source projects

418
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Cat Allman:>can apply to be mentoring organizations for

419
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.980
<v Cat Allman:>a period of months, where they will

420
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.040
<v Cat Allman:>accept, used to be students, now it

421
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Cat Allman:>can be anybody, to work on their

422
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.760
<v Cat Allman:>projects, Google supplies a stipend for the

423
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.800
<v Cat Allman:>contributor, they're called now, they used to

424
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.580
<v Cat Allman:>be called students, now they're called contributors,

425
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Cat Allman:>to work with that project directly on

426
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.180
<v Cat Allman:>pre-agreed upon projects to benefit that project.

427
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.740
<v Cat Allman:>Ultimately, as I know the origin story,

428
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Cat Allman:>Google Summer of Code came about because

429
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.140
<v Cat Allman:>Larry Page came up behind Chris DeBona,

430
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Cat Allman:>Larry Page being one of Google's founders,

431
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.340
<v Cat Allman:>came up behind Chris DeBona, the head

432
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.159
<v Cat Allman:>of the open source programs office, and

433
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.780
<v Cat Allman:>said, it seems like people, students are

434
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Cat Allman:>losing their skills over the summer working

435
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Cat Allman:>non-computer related jobs fixed that.

436
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Cat Allman:>And Chris being Chris saw it as

437
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.740
<v Cat Allman:>an opportunity to get more people contributing

438
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Cat Allman:>to free and open source software.

439
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Cat Allman:>So that's what he did.

440
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.360
<v Cat Allman:>He designed a program that addressed Larry's

441
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.500
<v Cat Allman:>concerns while pulling more people into the

442
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.120
<v Cat Allman:>free and open source software movement and

443
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.220
<v Cat Allman:>getting projects that were interested in mentoring

444
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Cat Allman:>new contributors some help getting those people

445
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Cat Allman:>engaged.

446
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Cat Allman:>It's still going on.

447
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.480
<v Cat Allman:>I'm trying to think.

448
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.720
<v Cat Allman:>Last time I ran the numbers, which

449
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.620
<v Cat Allman:>was a few years ago, we had

450
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.800
<v Cat Allman:>worked with over 650 projects from around

451
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Cat Allman:>the world and many thousands not only

452
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.400
<v Cat Allman:>of students but mentors.

453
00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.520
<v Cat Allman:>I have to say it's one of

454
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.220
<v Cat Allman:>the things I'm really proud of having

455
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.620
<v Cat Allman:>been able to support in any way.

456
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Cat Allman:>It's, you meet all kinds of people

457
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.820
<v Cat Allman:>working in our funny little ecosystem and

458
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Cat Allman:>working on GSoC gave me the opportunity

459
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.440
<v Cat Allman:>to meet a heck of a lot

460
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Cat Allman:>of them, which I really cherish that.

461
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.720
<v Cat Allman:>I was always kind of envious that

462
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.680
<v Cat Allman:>my brother and his friends working in

463
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.260
<v Cat Allman:>computer science got to travel and knew

464
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.820
<v Cat Allman:>people all over the world and had

465
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.260
<v Cat Allman:>this pretty vast network of friends and

466
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Cat Allman:>colleagues.

467
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Cat Allman:>And by working on Summer of Code

468
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Cat Allman:>in particular, I got to have that

469
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.300
<v Cat Allman:>too.

470
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.680
<v Cat Allman:>And I got to travel, woo, which

471
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.440
<v Cat Allman:>I really wanted to do.

472
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.300
<v Cat Allman:>We did a certain amount of outreach

473
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.460
<v Cat Allman:>to encourage more participation, particularly in underrepresented

474
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.900
<v Cat Allman:>areas, so I've had the opportunity to

475
00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Cat Allman:>speak at engineering schools in Singapore and

476
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:10.100
<v Cat Allman:>Cambodia, Vietnam, Germany, India, let's see, Taiwan,

477
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.820
<v Cat Allman:>a bunch of places.

478
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.360
<v Cat Allman:>It's still haven't gotten to South America,

479
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.738
<v Cat Allman:>that's very disappointing.

480
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Cat Allman:>But I did get to Australia and

481
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Cat Allman:>New Zealand quite a bit, which was

482
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.640
<v Cat Allman:>wonderful.

483
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.340
<v Cat Allman:>That I mean, aside from the fact

484
00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.560
<v Cat Allman:>that open source drives the global economy

485
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Cat Allman:>by providing the underlying infrastructure for computer

486
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.280
<v Cat Allman:>services.

487
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.440
<v Cat Allman:>The global network of people engaged in

488
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Cat Allman:>this is incredibly important to me, and

489
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.520
<v Cat Allman:>not just because I'm talking to somebody

490
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:56.460
<v Cat Allman:>who's in Italy right now, but there's

491
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Cat Allman:>a lot of divisiveness in the world

492
00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.540
<v Cat Allman:>right now.

493
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.600
<v Cat Allman:>And I'm not saying everything in free

494
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.320
<v Cat Allman:>and open source software is all kittens

495
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Cat Allman:>and rainbows because there are some fairly

496
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Cat Allman:>extreme personalities involved.

497
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Cat Allman:>But overall, what I hear from people,

498
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.160
<v Cat Allman:>past participants in GSoC, is that participating

499
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Cat Allman:>in open source has expanded their knowledge

500
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.220
<v Cat Allman:>of the world, be it coming from

501
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.800
<v Cat Allman:>a secondary engineering school in Sri Lanka

502
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.740
<v Cat Allman:>and ending up in a PhD program

503
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Cat Allman:>in the United States or simply having

504
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Cat Allman:>the opportunity to work with people who

505
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.500
<v Cat Allman:>are clear around the world from them.

506
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Cat Allman:>And it can't be discounted that as

507
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.860
<v Cat Allman:>the awareness for free and open source

508
00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Cat Allman:>software in industry has grown, it is

509
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.940
<v Cat Allman:>participating in floss is increasingly a requirement

510
00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.620
<v Cat Allman:>to get a job.

511
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.280
<v Cat Allman:>So there's the economic opportunity, which is

512
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.020
<v Cat Allman:>something I used to talk about at

513
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Cat Allman:>engineering schools in places like Phnom Penh.

514
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Cat Allman:>The engineering school I spoke at there

515
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.760
<v Cat Allman:>didn't have glass in the windows, but

516
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Cat Allman:>they did have computers and wonderfully optimistic

517
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.980
<v Cat Allman:>and hungry population of students who wanted

518
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.320
<v Cat Allman:>to make their lives better and the

519
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.280
<v Cat Allman:>lives of their families better and open

520
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.740
<v Cat Allman:>source gave them a way to do

521
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.240
<v Cat Allman:>that.

522
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.000
<v Cat Allman:>So I feel very privileged to have

523
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.600
<v Cat Allman:>been a part of it in any

524
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.100
<v Cat Allman:>way.

525
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.380
<v Cat Allman:>And since I mentioned any way, I

526
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Cat Allman:>should bring up alternative forms of contribution.

527
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.080
<v Cat Allman:>I was reluctant to do this interview

528
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.240
<v Cat Allman:>because in a lot of ways I

529
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Cat Allman:>still feel like I'm not a real

530
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.470
<v Cat Allman:>floss contributor because I don't code.

531
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, I noodled around with PostScript

532
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Cat Allman:>back in the day, but I'm not

533
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Cat Allman:>a coder, nor do I have formal

534
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.200
<v Cat Allman:>engineering training.

535
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.260
<v Cat Allman:>So I've always felt like an imposter.

536
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.600
<v Cat Allman:>At the same time, something that has

537
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Cat Allman:>been wonderful to see over the last

538
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Cat Allman:>30-ish years is, 30, 25, 25 years,

539
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Cat Allman:>is the growing appreciation for non-code contributions.

540
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.080
<v Cat Allman:>People coming to appreciate that they're not

541
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Cat Allman:>just nice to have, like, oh, somebody

542
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.660
<v Cat Allman:>got us coffee, but critical to have,

543
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.100
<v Cat Allman:>be it raising money so that people

544
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Cat Allman:>have the equipment and bandwidth they need.

545
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.820
<v Cat Allman:>Thank God people are figuring out documentation.

546
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Cat Allman:>But also the community building, which is

547
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.100
<v Cat Allman:>really where I find myself really focused.

548
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.680
<v Cat Allman:>The past several years I've been focused

549
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.620
<v Cat Allman:>on a conference that I'm deeply proud

550
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Cat Allman:>to be a contributor to as a

551
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.520
<v Cat Allman:>co-organizer called Science Foo Camp with O'Reilly

552
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.100
<v Cat Allman:>Media.

553
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.160
<v Cat Allman:>The Foo stands for Friends of O'Reilly.

554
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Cat Allman:>Nature, the scientific publishing company, and Digital

555
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.960
<v Cat Allman:>Science, which is a company in the

556
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.800
<v Cat Allman:>same media group as Nature that builds

557
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.720
<v Cat Allman:>digital tools to aid scientific research.

558
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.860
<v Cat Allman:>It's an interdisciplinary conference where we invite

559
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.540
<v Cat Allman:>people from up and down the career

560
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.680
<v Cat Allman:>stack and all across the spectrum of

561
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.020
<v Cat Allman:>the sciences to come together for an

562
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Cat Allman:>unconference.

563
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.040
<v Cat Allman:>An unconference being essentially the hallway track,

564
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.160
<v Cat Allman:>all those fascinating, weird conversations you have

565
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.780
<v Cat Allman:>in the hallways and over meals at

566
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Cat Allman:>conferences.

567
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.800
<v Cat Allman:>An unconference gives you the opportunity to

568
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.820
<v Cat Allman:>focus the entire event on those kinds

569
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.360
<v Cat Allman:>of conversations, what people are thinking about

570
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Cat Allman:>now, what they're maybe planning to do

571
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.960
<v Cat Allman:>and want feedback on.

572
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.040
<v Cat Allman:>So I've been working on this conference,

573
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.180
<v Cat Allman:>SciFu as we call it, since 2007

574
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Cat Allman:>when I started at Google.

575
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.040
<v Cat Allman:>Because back then my manager at the

576
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.960
<v Cat Allman:>time, not Chris, didn't, she wanted to

577
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Cat Allman:>focus more specifically on software.

578
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.680
<v Cat Allman:>And the concept of open science, open

579
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Cat Allman:>data, open hardware to a lesser extent

580
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.660
<v Cat Allman:>was really new.

581
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.560
<v Cat Allman:>And so I stepped in to get

582
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Cat Allman:>to be Google's lead on it, which

583
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.020
<v Cat Allman:>I really enjoy, and I am continuing

584
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.220
<v Cat Allman:>to do that to this day, including

585
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.460
<v Cat Allman:>creating an alumni community for past participants

586
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.420
<v Cat Allman:>in the conference.

587
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.920
<v Cat Allman:>So it ranges far afield from strictly

588
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.740
<v Cat Allman:>open source, open science, etc.

589
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.600
<v Cat Allman:>But increasingly, you can't do science without

590
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Cat Allman:>computers.

591
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.300
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, you still, there's the natural

592
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Cat Allman:>world and reagents and lab equipment, et

593
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.080
<v Cat Allman:>cetera, and computers are ubiquitous.

594
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Cat Allman:>And increasingly people are appreciating, especially in

595
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.920
<v Cat Allman:>the US, as budgets for academic research

596
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Cat Allman:>are increasingly not keeping pace with inflation.

597
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.620
<v Cat Allman:>The opportunity to use free and open

598
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.780
<v Cat Allman:>source software in place of commercial programs

599
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Cat Allman:>is increasingly important.

600
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Cat Allman:>And, for example, the Carpentries, which you

601
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.140
<v Cat Allman:>may have heard of, was a participant

602
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.780
<v Cat Allman:>in the ESOC a number of times.

603
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.939
<v Cat Allman:>One of my favorite projects because it

604
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Cat Allman:>is a program that pulls together volunteer-driven

605
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Cat Allman:>workshops at universities and research institutions, not

606
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Cat Allman:>just in the US but around the

607
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.540
<v Cat Allman:>world, to teach researchers the basics of

608
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.000
<v Cat Allman:>using free and open source software to

609
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.180
<v Cat Allman:>accomplish their research.

610
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Cat Allman:>So it's kind of a, I don't

611
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.379
<v Cat Allman:>want to call it a gateway drug

612
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Cat Allman:>because that sounds nefarious, but It does,

613
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.940
<v Cat Allman:>again, pull more people into the ecosystem

614
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Cat Allman:>and benefits science, which I think benefits

615
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Cat Allman:>us all.

616
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.440
<v Cat Allman:>And I've been talking nonstop and not

617
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.860
<v Cat Allman:>giving you a chance to ask any

618
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.360
<v Cat Allman:>questions.

619
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.620
<v Cat Allman:>So hit me.

620
00:29:33.055 --> 00:29:34.289
<v Elisabetta Mori:>That's fine.

621
00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:39.424
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what do you think are the

622
00:29:39.658 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Elisabetta Mori:>challenges and opportunities that you built, the

623
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>impact you had on building these communities?

624
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.414
<v Cat Allman:>Ah, well, while I was helping with-

625
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Cat Allman:>speaking about Google, I actually had a

626
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.020
<v Cat Allman:>job job in addition to managing the

627
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.760
<v Cat Allman:>team at one point, teams at the

628
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Cat Allman:>same time.

629
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Cat Allman:>But anyway, my job "job" was choosing

630
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.960
<v Cat Allman:>projects to provide sponsorship money to and

631
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.940
<v Cat Allman:>getting that money out to them, largely

632
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:20.340
<v Cat Allman:>for events, but also direct sponsorships of

633
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Cat Allman:>open source projects and organizations.

634
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.180
<v Cat Allman:>Which I gotta say, as jobs go,

635
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Cat Allman:>having been on the other side of

636
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.860
<v Cat Allman:>the desk, asking for money for a

637
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.700
<v Cat Allman:>nonprofit, getting to give money to nonprofits

638
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.540
<v Cat Allman:>is rather enjoyable, especially by comparison.

639
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Cat Allman:>It's really satisfying to know that you

640
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.700
<v Cat Allman:>can, I shouldn't say this, but I'm

641
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.899
<v Cat Allman:>going to use Google's money to support

642
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.220
<v Cat Allman:>something I believe in?

643
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Cat Allman:>Also, because a lot of sponsorships coming

644
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.840
<v Cat Allman:>from commercial organizations to FLOSS projects are

645
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Cat Allman:>earmarked specifically there to sponsor conferences where

646
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.980
<v Cat Allman:>people get marketing exposure, or if it's

647
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Cat Allman:>not event-related or program-related, it tends to

648
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.700
<v Cat Allman:>be tied to a specific development effort.

649
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.640
<v Cat Allman:>When I was doing it, I always

650
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Cat Allman:>tried as much as possible to make

651
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.560
<v Cat Allman:>it an unsecured sponsorship, so that the

652
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.580
<v Cat Allman:>projects could use it for unglamorous things

653
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Cat Allman:>like bandwidths and paying people to do

654
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.440
<v Cat Allman:>the kind of work that companies don't

655
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Cat Allman:>want to pay for and that volunteers

656
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Cat Allman:>aren't interested in doing, doing the grunge

657
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.940
<v Cat Allman:>work.

658
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Cat Allman:>All the overhead stuff that people don't

659
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.080
<v Cat Allman:>realize exists because, hey, it's free software,

660
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.220
<v Cat Allman:>it's all free, right?

661
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.480
<v Cat Allman:>Not so much really.

662
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.919
<v Cat Allman:>Back in the day, you had to

663
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.360
<v Cat Allman:>pay your ISP bill.

664
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Cat Allman:>Now, you may have cloud services bills,

665
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.500
<v Cat Allman:>you may need new hardware, you may

666
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Cat Allman:>want to bring your developers together from

667
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.080
<v Cat Allman:>time to time physically to brainstorm your

668
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.720
<v Cat Allman:>roadmap for the next year.

669
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.020
<v Cat Allman:>So lots of things to think about,

670
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Cat Allman:>actually.

671
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.600
<v Cat Allman:>Challenges going forward to the FLOSS ecosystem.

672
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.980
<v Cat Allman:>Something that I'm really concerned about, And

673
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:38.040
<v Cat Allman:>I'm conflicted about it is, FLOSS is

674
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.420
<v Cat Allman:>one of those 20 plus year overnight

675
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:40.980
<v Cat Allman:>successes.

676
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Cat Allman:>It's been around a long time, but

677
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.360
<v Cat Allman:>it's only now that people, businesses are

678
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Cat Allman:>appreciating how essential it is.

679
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Cat Allman:>At the same time, they still want

680
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Cat Allman:>the code for free.

681
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, lots of businesses like Google

682
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.280
<v Cat Allman:>are understanding the importance of working with

683
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Cat Allman:>projects so that they are sustainable, they

684
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.160
<v Cat Allman:>have the economic and other resources that

685
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Cat Allman:>they need to continue.

686
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Cat Allman:>But what I worry about is the

687
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Cat Allman:>psychological aspects.

688
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.840
<v Cat Allman:>Back when free and open source software

689
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.360
<v Cat Allman:>was done by people who cared passionately

690
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Cat Allman:>about it.

691
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, back in the day, people

692
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.620
<v Cat Allman:>didn't go into computer science because, oh,

693
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Cat Allman:>I'm going to get rich.

694
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.480
<v Cat Allman:>They would go to law school or

695
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.620
<v Cat Allman:>something like that.

696
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.360
<v Cat Allman:>They would get a business degree.

697
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:42.120
<v Cat Allman:>But now, computer science is seen as

698
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.260
<v Cat Allman:>a safe way to make a good

699
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:44.760
<v Cat Allman:>living.

700
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:54.340
<v Cat Allman:>Nothing wrong with that, but FLOSS has

701
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.440
<v Cat Allman:>been a volunteer ecosystem, and when you

702
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.720
<v Cat Allman:>make it a requirement to get a

703
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Cat Allman:>job, then it becomes a transactional ecosystem

704
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.340
<v Cat Allman:>in a way that it wasn't before.

705
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.200
<v Cat Allman:>And what I'm hearing from younger students

706
00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.400
<v Cat Allman:>in particular, and some older ones too,

707
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.060
<v Cat Allman:>is that they want to get paid.

708
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Cat Allman:>Yes, it's free software, but they don't

709
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.540
<v Cat Allman:>want to do the development work unless

710
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.940
<v Cat Allman:>they are getting paid.

711
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Cat Allman:>Corporations are making large sums of money

712
00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.280
<v Cat Allman:>on the backs of people who have

713
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Cat Allman:>done it for love.

714
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.620
<v Cat Allman:>And at this point, they want to

715
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.320
<v Cat Allman:>get paid.

716
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.120
<v Cat Allman:>And who can blame them?

717
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Cat Allman:>It's almost like free and open source

718
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.279
<v Cat Allman:>software development is that extra job that

719
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Cat Allman:>theoretically women have.

720
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.659
<v Cat Allman:>You know they work all day and

721
00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.839
<v Cat Allman:>then they come home and they've got

722
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.279
<v Cat Allman:>their second job in the home.

723
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.760
<v Cat Allman:>Well, now people have their day job

724
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.080
<v Cat Allman:>and then they come home and they

725
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Cat Allman:>code at night.

726
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Cat Allman:>And I really see that volunteer flywheel

727
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:11.180
<v Cat Allman:>breaking down, so much so that I'm

728
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.799
<v Cat Allman:>really worried about it, actually, that if

729
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Cat Allman:>people stop volunteering, that the licensing structure

730
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Cat Allman:>won't hold.

731
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.820
<v Cat Allman:>Also as you have companies who start

732
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.280
<v Cat Allman:>out as free and open source software

733
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.480
<v Cat Allman:>hybrid businesses relicensing their software in such

734
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Cat Allman:>a way that it is no longer

735
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Cat Allman:>compliant with the Open Source Initiative definitions

736
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Cat Allman:>of the various licenses.

737
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.660
<v Cat Allman:>And I mean, I don't know how

738
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.740
<v Cat Allman:>to do that.

739
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.760
<v Cat Allman:>Goodwill is not an engine.

740
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.839
<v Cat Allman:>If you have to apply heat in

741
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.440
<v Cat Allman:>the form of money, I don't know.

742
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.620
<v Cat Allman:>I don't know that the center is

743
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.000
<v Cat Allman:>going to hold and that the system

744
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.280
<v Cat Allman:>is going to hold up.

745
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.320
<v Cat Allman:>I worry that in about five years

746
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.020
<v Cat Allman:>it's all going to have broken down,

747
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.600
<v Cat Allman:>which would be a shame.

748
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.020
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, on the one hand, everything

749
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.980
<v Cat Allman:>has a life cycle and the wheel

750
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.180
<v Cat Allman:>turns and that's just what happens, but

751
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.280
<v Cat Allman:>I would really hate to see the

752
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.614
<v Cat Allman:>force of innovation in community that FLOSS

753
00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Cat Allman:>has been for me and my network

754
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Cat Allman:>of friends die.

755
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Cat Allman:>I don't know how we fix this.

756
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.339
<v Cat Allman:>I don't know how we, what I

757
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.140
<v Cat Allman:>don't want to have happen is that

758
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:57.020
<v Cat Allman:>people in under-resourced countries continue to participate

759
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Cat Allman:>in free and open source software as

760
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.540
<v Cat Allman:>a way to make some money and

761
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.360
<v Cat Allman:>potentially move to a higher resourced area,

762
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Cat Allman:>but that becomes a kind of digital

763
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.220
<v Cat Allman:>serfdom, and I really don't want to

764
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Cat Allman:>see that happen.

765
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.839
<v Cat Allman:>More than it already is with data

766
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Cat Allman:>sets for large learning models, but that's

767
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Cat Allman:>another thing.

768
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Cat Allman:>So that's my concern and I don't

769
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.340
<v Cat Allman:>know what's going to happen.

770
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.140
<v Cat Allman:>It's been interesting to watch.

771
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.160
<v Cat Allman:>It seems increasingly like there is a

772
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.500
<v Cat Allman:>movement in the United States to discontinue

773
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.180
<v Cat Allman:>open source programs offices and take the

774
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.319
<v Cat Allman:>compliance, license compliance and other aspects that

775
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Cat Allman:>are generally managed by OSPOs and spread

776
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Cat Allman:>them out so that the compliance goes

777
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Cat Allman:>to legal and the sponsorship for sustainability

778
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.799
<v Cat Allman:>goes to marketing and again I would

779
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Cat Allman:>hate to see that happen because having,

780
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Cat Allman:>we'll say, pushed back against various marketing

781
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.140
<v Cat Allman:>teams over several decades, I think that

782
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.800
<v Cat Allman:>has the potential to exacerbate the shift

783
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.000
<v Cat Allman:>from volunteerism and really altruism and in,

784
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Cat Allman:>well, I'll call it altruism, call it

785
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.859
<v Cat Allman:>enlightened self-interest of participating in free and

786
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.620
<v Cat Allman:>open source to a strictly commercial relationship.

787
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Cat Allman:>But I hope I'm just being pessimistic.

788
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.320
<v Cat Allman:>We'll see.

789
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:46.920
<v Cat Allman:>Oh, dear.

790
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.120
<v Cat Allman:>I hope we're not frozen.

791
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.880
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay, sorry, I'm going to rephrase.

792
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, what activities have you pursued since

793
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.880
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you left Google?

794
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.740
<v Cat Allman:>Ah, well, I honestly thought when I

795
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.839
<v Cat Allman:>got laid off from Google that the

796
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.040
<v Cat Allman:>boards I was on would ask me

797
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.480
<v Cat Allman:>to step down so they could get

798
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.700
<v Cat Allman:>another Google person.

799
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.339
<v Cat Allman:>But I'm happy to say that in

800
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.439
<v Cat Allman:>both cases, they were like, actually all

801
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.279
<v Cat Allman:>three cases, they were like, "no, no,

802
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.460
<v Cat Allman:>we want you, not the company." So

803
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.620
<v Cat Allman:>that's good.

804
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.819
<v Cat Allman:>In fact, the IEEE one wanted me

805
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Cat Allman:>to be vice chair.

806
00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Cat Allman:>So I'm doing that.

807
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you name these boards?

808
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.420
<v Cat Allman:>Sure.

809
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Cat Allman:>Committee for the, God it's so long,

810
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.720
<v Cat Allman:>the digital testbed out of universities in

811
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Cat Allman:>Oregon and British Columbia.

812
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Cat Allman:>And apologies to John Fink, who's rolling

813
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Cat Allman:>his eyes at me right now, one

814
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.680
<v Cat Allman:>moment.

815
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay, Digital Testbed Center Advisory Board.

816
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.600
<v Cat Allman:>Let me get this important, and maybe

817
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.240
<v Cat Allman:>you can edit it for me.

818
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I lost you.

819
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:24.840
<v Cat Allman:>Portland State University Digital Cities Test FreeBSD

820
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.980
<v Cat Allman:>Foundation Board and the committee for IEEE

821
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:38.399
<v Cat Allman:>Standards Association Open Source Committee, OSCON, are

822
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Cat Allman:>the official boards I'm on.

823
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Cat Allman:>I'm also, my main thing I've been

824
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.759
<v Cat Allman:>working on is, I've been contracting with

825
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.299
<v Cat Allman:>digital science out of the UK to

826
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.939
<v Cat Allman:>help land that while working closely not

827
00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.340
<v Cat Allman:>only with O'Reilly and nature but also

828
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.759
<v Cat Allman:>Google because when they laid me off

829
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.680
<v Cat Allman:>they didn't cancel the program, they just

830
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.520
<v Cat Allman:>laid off the only person working on

831
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.020
<v Cat Allman:>it.

832
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.320
<v Cat Allman:>And I knew the person that they

833
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Cat Allman:>drafted to pick up my work, and

834
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.540
<v Cat Allman:>I wasn't just going to leave her

835
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Cat Allman:>twisting in the wind.

836
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.200
<v Cat Allman:>An event came down the weekend before

837
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.040
<v Cat Allman:>last, mid-July, excuse me.

838
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.780
<v Cat Allman:>And we are already deep in conversation

839
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.880
<v Cat Allman:>about 2024.

840
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Cat Allman:>People have given me grief for when

841
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.080
<v Cat Allman:>I'm not getting paid, at least not

842
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.340
<v Cat Allman:>as much as I was.

843
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.600
<v Cat Allman:>But the truth is, I really love

844
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.560
<v Cat Allman:>what I do.

845
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.520
<v Cat Allman:>And I'm not going to stop.

846
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.520
<v Cat Allman:>The great thing is it's not a

847
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.060
<v Cat Allman:>Google program so Google legal can't make

848
00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:54.760
<v Cat Allman:>me stop.

849
00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Cat Allman:>Plus it looks like I'm going to

850
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.259
<v Cat Allman:>be working for digital science as an

851
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.660
<v Cat Allman:>employee to continue not only the conference

852
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.680
<v Cat Allman:>itself, looks like we're gonna be doing

853
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.839
<v Cat Allman:>it at Cambridge University next summer, which

854
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Cat Allman:>I'm super excited about.

855
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.040
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, Cambridge, but also the alumni

856
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.580
<v Cat Allman:>community.

857
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.540
<v Cat Allman:>It's not large, but with a thousand

858
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.640
<v Cat Allman:>opinionated people, it's sometimes a handful.

859
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.760
<v Cat Allman:>But obviously during COVID, we talked about

860
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.860
<v Cat Allman:>COVID and vaccine science.

861
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.299
<v Cat Allman:>Right now we're talking about AI because

862
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.100
<v Cat Allman:>the world is talking about AI, but

863
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Cat Allman:>lots of other things going on.

864
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Cat Allman:>And it's pretty heady when somebody talks

865
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.839
<v Cat Allman:>about public health to have someone like

866
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.859
<v Cat Allman:>Larry Brilliant, who was on the team

867
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.500
<v Cat Allman:>that ended smallpox, chime in.

868
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Cat Allman:>Or Vint Cerf, arguably the father of

869
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.700
<v Cat Allman:>the internet, will pop in and always

870
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:06.340
<v Cat Allman:>ask, I love, his messages are always

871
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.260
<v Cat Allman:>very brief.

872
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Cat Allman:>There's that old saying, it's, I would

873
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.339
<v Cat Allman:>have written a short, I didn't have

874
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Cat Allman:>time to write a short message, so

875
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.480
<v Cat Allman:>I wrote a long one.

876
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.480
<v Cat Allman:>Vint writes short messages because he's just

877
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.879
<v Cat Allman:>that smart, which is really fun to

878
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.380
<v Cat Allman:>watch.

879
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.100
<v Cat Allman:>So yeah, that's what I'm doing.

880
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.560
<v Cat Allman:>FreeBSD project, we're working with Core.

881
00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Cat Allman:>The project is run, there's the foundation,

882
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.860
<v Cat Allman:>the nonprofit that provides essentially support services,

883
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.240
<v Cat Allman:>etc.

884
00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.560
<v Cat Allman:>For the project, which is managed by

885
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Cat Allman:>kind of an elected group of people

886
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Cat Allman:>called core, and they're the technical people

887
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Cat Allman:>that are doing the technical work.

888
00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.020
<v Cat Allman:>And collectively, we're trying to work more

889
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.540
<v Cat Allman:>closely together so that we can coordinate

890
00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.560
<v Cat Allman:>our efforts to make everything better.

891
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.080
<v Cat Allman:>Not that things are bad, but just

892
00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.980
<v Cat Allman:>making it better.

893
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So if you look at your career,

894
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.760
<v Elisabetta Mori:>is there anything you would do differently

895
00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.700
<v Elisabetta Mori:>if you had your time again?

896
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.246
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And why?

897
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.440
<v Cat Allman:>If I could start over in junior

898
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Cat Allman:>high school now, I would have been

899
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.779
<v Cat Allman:>less of a visible nerd, more of

900
00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.580
<v Cat Allman:>a stealth nerd, and probably gone into

901
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.580
<v Cat Allman:>the biological sciences in some respects.

902
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.879
<v Cat Allman:>But the truth is, I don't want

903
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.040
<v Cat Allman:>to do over because I love my

904
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.540
<v Cat Allman:>life.

905
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.400
<v Cat Allman:>People are wonderful.

906
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.760
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, not everybody.

907
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.400
<v Cat Allman:>I mean, I live in America.

908
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.500
<v Cat Allman:>People suck sometimes, but the community that

909
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.840
<v Cat Allman:>I have found in free and open

910
00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Cat Allman:>source software, it's a wonderful thing with

911
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Cat Allman:>a really interesting group of people.

912
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.419
<v Cat Allman:>And I can be as nerdy as

913
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.819
<v Cat Allman:>I want to be, which makes me

914
00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.660
<v Cat Allman:>very happy.

915
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Cat Allman:>And I can feel like in whatever

916
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.299
<v Cat Allman:>small way I'm contributing to making the

917
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.880
<v Cat Allman:>world better, which matters to me.

918
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.700
<v Cat Allman:>I hope it matters to a lot

919
00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.360
<v Cat Allman:>of people.

920
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.140
<v Cat Allman:>I think it matters to more than

921
00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.740
<v Cat Allman:>the average percent of people in the

922
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.839
<v Cat Allman:>FLOSS world, which once again, here I

923
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Cat Allman:>am.

924
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:30.586
<v Cat Allman:>So.

925
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So is there a project you're particularly

926
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.200
<v Elisabetta Mori:>proud of or what is your proudest

927
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.700
<v Elisabetta Mori:>achievement?

928
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Cat Allman:>At the risk of sounding hopelessly vain,

929
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.939
<v Cat Allman:>it's hard to pick because there are

930
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Cat Allman:>several.

931
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Cat Allman:>Being involved with Google Summer of Code

932
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.460
<v Cat Allman:>was such a blessing.

933
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Cat Allman:>I wasn't as involved with Google Code

934
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:12.100
<v Cat Allman:>in the high school program, but it

935
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.120
<v Cat Allman:>was really inspiring and reassuring to meet

936
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.240
<v Cat Allman:>kids, I can call them kids because

937
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.160
<v Cat Allman:>they're under 18, from all over the

938
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.120
<v Cat Allman:>world that were just that smart and

939
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.100
<v Cat Allman:>that passionate about what they were doing.

940
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.300
<v Cat Allman:>In terms of funding, at one point

941
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.360
<v Cat Allman:>we had spun up a team inside

942
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Cat Allman:>Google called Making in Science, specifically addressing

943
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.800
<v Cat Allman:>DOI, Making in Science, or more specifically

944
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.760
<v Cat Allman:>STEM education.

945
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.200
<v Cat Allman:>At one point I had money left

946
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.940
<v Cat Allman:>over in a budget there, so there's

947
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.480
<v Cat Allman:>the WikiEDU project, which is a spin-out

948
00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Cat Allman:>of the Wikimedia Foundation, where they have

949
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:07.320
<v Cat Allman:>a program working with professors to have

950
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Cat Allman:>students learn how to, to Wikipedia, improving

951
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.780
<v Cat Allman:>their science skills and also so that

952
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.759
<v Cat Allman:>writing term papers that end up in

953
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.140
<v Cat Allman:>their parents' basement, they write Wikipedia articles

954
00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.580
<v Cat Allman:>increasing the amount of knowledge available to

955
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.260
<v Cat Allman:>us all.

956
00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.439
<v Cat Allman:>In one month, they did a year

957
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Cat Allman:>of science with a specific focus on

958
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Cat Allman:>increasing content in Wikipedia about women in

959
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.140
<v Cat Allman:>science, in one month alone, that content

960
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.140
<v Cat Allman:>increased by, I forget if it was

961
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Cat Allman:>7 or 14%.

962
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.340
<v Cat Allman:>And when you think about the impact

963
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.580
<v Cat Allman:>of just that much more knowledge about

964
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.720
<v Cat Allman:>the importance of women in science, I

965
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Cat Allman:>am really proud about having been able

966
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Cat Allman:>to provide financial support for that effort.

967
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.600
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So talking about diversity in the computer

968
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>science industry, what are your thoughts for

969
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the future?

970
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.960
<v Cat Allman:>Well, Back in the 80s when I

971
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Cat Allman:>got involved with this, yes, there were

972
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Cat Allman:>still more men than women, but there

973
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.600
<v Cat Allman:>were a lot of women in the

974
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.680
<v Cat Allman:>academic setting.

975
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Cat Allman:>I knew a number of female professors

976
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.980
<v Cat Allman:>and contributors.

977
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.319
<v Cat Allman:>So I didn't really see it as

978
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Cat Allman:>an issue, but then as computer science

979
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:45.860
<v Cat Allman:>became more business focused and more people

980
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.920
<v Cat Allman:>studied for the career opportunities rather than

981
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Cat Allman:>passion, that number decreased.

982
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.100
<v Cat Allman:>And it took me a while to

983
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.779
<v Cat Allman:>notice, really, because I would go to

984
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.220
<v Cat Allman:>conferences in the 90s, and people would

985
00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.560
<v Cat Allman:>say, "oh, women are in open source.

986
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.460
<v Cat Allman:>I'm like, what are you talking about?

987
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.900
<v Cat Allman:>This person and that person.

988
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.620
<v Cat Allman:>Then I realized those ladies are retiring

989
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.740
<v Cat Allman:>and they're not necessarily being replaced by

990
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.660
<v Cat Allman:>female professors.

991
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.280
<v Cat Allman:>So there was an issue and yes,

992
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.720
<v Cat Allman:>at one point I was at a

993
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.060
<v Cat Allman:>conference about C++.

994
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.480
<v Cat Allman:>And I looked around the room and

995
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Cat Allman:>I realized out of 50 people, I

996
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.160
<v Cat Allman:>was the only woman.

997
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.359
<v Cat Allman:>And then a guy said something about

998
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.500
<v Cat Allman:>making him a sandwich.

999
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.200
<v Cat Allman:>I was like, "oh, okay, that's what

1000
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.400
<v Cat Allman:>they were talking about.

1001
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.259
<v Cat Allman:>Got it." And I tell friends of

1002
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.799
<v Cat Allman:>mine in other industries, some of the

1003
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.120
<v Cat Allman:>stories of what it was like in

1004
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Cat Allman:>the 80s and what it was like.

1005
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.100
<v Cat Allman:>Because there was definitely a boys club

1006
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.600
<v Cat Allman:>and not just a lack of respect,

1007
00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.620
<v Cat Allman:>but disrespect towards people in non-coding world.

1008
00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.080
<v Cat Allman:>And the assumption that if you were

1009
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Cat Allman:>female, you were not able to code

1010
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Cat Allman:>and therefore not good at coding.

1011
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Cat Allman:>And I hadn't realized how much I

1012
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.880
<v Cat Allman:>had internalized that, but yeah.

1013
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:23.400
<v Cat Allman:>I'm delighted to say it isn't applied

1014
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Cat Allman:>equally globally.

1015
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.540
<v Cat Allman:>For example, I went to give a

1016
00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.720
<v Cat Allman:>talk about Summer of Code at a

1017
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.300
<v Cat Allman:>university in Oman in the Middle East.

1018
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.300
<v Cat Allman:>Before I agreed to go, I looked

1019
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.040
<v Cat Allman:>and the enrollment in the computer science

1020
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.260
<v Cat Allman:>department at that university skewed female.

1021
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.260
<v Cat Allman:>There were more women in the computer

1022
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Cat Allman:>science department than there were men.

1023
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.420
<v Cat Allman:>So even though I went to this

1024
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.060
<v Cat Allman:>university where the women were all fully

1025
00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.799
<v Cat Allman:>covered up except for their hands and

1026
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.980
<v Cat Allman:>their faces, not only were the majority

1027
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.120
<v Cat Allman:>of the students female, but the students

1028
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Cat Allman:>who were most engaged and passionate about

1029
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.540
<v Cat Allman:>free and open source software specifically were

1030
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.240
<v Cat Allman:>all women.

1031
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.520
<v Cat Allman:>And my understanding is that that is,

1032
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:17.259
<v Cat Allman:>it's in places where, well I'm not

1033
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.140
<v Cat Allman:>going to say that, but long story

1034
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Cat Allman:>short, sorry for rambling.

1035
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Cat Allman:>I think the potential is there for

1036
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Cat Allman:>it to be better.

1037
00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.480
<v Cat Allman:>I think as with American politics, we

1038
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Cat Allman:>are seeing a backlash as people see

1039
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.940
<v Cat Allman:>women coming in and not just women

1040
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:44.439
<v Cat Allman:>but underrepresented groups coming in see that

1041
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.319
<v Cat Allman:>as a loss of privilege rather than

1042
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.100
<v Cat Allman:>as an expansion of opportunity for everyone.

1043
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.593
<v Cat Allman:>But maybe the increasing ubiquity of FLOSS

1044
00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Cat Allman:>will address some of this, because the

1045
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.280
<v Cat Allman:>upside of market forces is it's harder

1046
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Cat Allman:>to be a jerk if there's money

1047
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Cat Allman:>on the table.

1048
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.300
<v Cat Allman:>So except if, well, maybe that's true.

1049
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.160
<v Cat Allman:>Actually, I'm second guessing myself.

1050
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.040
<v Cat Allman:>I would like that it's going to

1051
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Cat Allman:>get better.

1052
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.240
<v Cat Allman:>One thing I have noticed in the

1053
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Cat Allman:>past is some of our students, particularly

1054
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Cat Allman:>the high school students, they tell me

1055
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.860
<v Cat Allman:>about how the educational system in their

1056
00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.800
<v Cat Allman:>country is modeled in such a way

1057
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Cat Allman:>that, what's the word, individual initiative is

1058
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Cat Allman:>discouraged rather than encouraged.

1059
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Cat Allman:>I would argue that one reason why

1060
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:51.319
<v Cat Allman:>FLOSS has been as centered as it

1061
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.020
<v Cat Allman:>has been in the US and Western

1062
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Cat Allman:>Europe is because the education system provides

1063
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.380
<v Cat Allman:>more opportunity for students to pursue things

1064
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.560
<v Cat Allman:>they're interested in rather than in following

1065
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:11.919
<v Cat Allman:>a strict, largely focused on memorization of

1066
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.940
<v Cat Allman:>existing content.

1067
00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.640
<v Cat Allman:>That's just my feeling, I have no

1068
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.220
<v Cat Allman:>facts to back this up, so don't

1069
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.560
<v Cat Allman:>quote me, but yeah, I don't know

1070
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.940
<v Cat Allman:>what's going to happen there.

1071
00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.860
<v Cat Allman:>It'll be interesting.

1072
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Cat Allman:>It'll be interesting to see what happens

1073
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.080
<v Cat Allman:>with China, though the downside of trying

1074
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.339
<v Cat Allman:>to look to China to see a

1075
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:39.300
<v Cat Allman:>rise of open-source software is the difficulties

1076
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.860
<v Cat Allman:>with licenses and license compliance, but that's

1077
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.540
<v Cat Allman:>a story for lawyers.

1078
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What advice would you give to someone

1079
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>that might want to pursue your career?

1080
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.300
<v Cat Allman:>Be brave, be humble, but don't doubt

1081
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Cat Allman:>yourself.

1082
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.439
<v Cat Allman:>If imposter syndrome were fatal, I would

1083
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.460
<v Cat Allman:>be dead.

1084
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.160
<v Cat Allman:>So trust yourself.

1085
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.140
<v Cat Allman:>Trust yourself and enjoy yourself and pick

1086
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:19.820
<v Cat Allman:>your battles.

1087
00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.839
<v Cat Allman:>If you get angry about every little

1088
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.660
<v Cat Allman:>thing, you're gonna be angry a lot

1089
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Cat Allman:>and that's a waste of time and

1090
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.040
<v Cat Allman:>energy.

1091
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Cat Allman:>On the other hand, don't let people...

1092
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:35.120
<v Cat Allman:>regulate accounts.

1093
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.120
<v Cat Allman:>Yeah, I have to say the world

1094
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Cat Allman:>has gotten better.

1095
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.560
<v Cat Allman:>And it's hard to recognize that when

1096
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.920
<v Cat Allman:>it's happening to you.

1097
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.720
<v Cat Allman:>But I like to tell people, some

1098
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.399
<v Cat Allman:>of my colleagues, that for example, when

1099
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.959
<v Cat Allman:>I started working out of college, help

1100
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Cat Allman:>wanted ads were segregated by gender.

1101
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.240
<v Cat Allman:>You couldn't even apply to certain jobs

1102
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Cat Allman:>if you were female.

1103
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.680
<v Cat Allman:>I was in a session at a

1104
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.440
<v Cat Allman:>conference about diversity and equity and going

1105
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.240
<v Cat Allman:>around the room and people sharing their

1106
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Cat Allman:>concerns and one person was very upset

1107
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Cat Allman:>about people using the word guys as

1108
00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Cat Allman:>an inclusive pronoun.

1109
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.460
<v Cat Allman:>Hey guys, we're going to go to...

1110
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.700
<v Cat Allman:>they felt very excluded by this.

1111
00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.379
<v Cat Allman:>And then it was my turn and

1112
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.779
<v Cat Allman:>I talked about the time I was

1113
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.420
<v Cat Allman:>in a staff meeting at the design

1114
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.560
<v Cat Allman:>firm and the senior most designer announced

1115
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.500
<v Cat Allman:>her pregnancy and the CEO of the

1116
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.839
<v Cat Allman:>company looked at her and said, "well

1117
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Cat Allman:>you are going to get an abortion

1118
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.760
<v Cat Allman:>aren't you?" Things are better now.

1119
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Cat Allman:>Things are.

1120
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Cat Allman:>It's hard to see and they're not

1121
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Cat Allman:>necessarily great, but they are better.

1122
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.520
<v Cat Allman:>And so don't lose hope, even though

1123
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.720
<v Cat Allman:>there are times when you want to

1124
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.980
<v Cat Allman:>wring people's necks.

1125
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Is there anything you would like to

1126
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>add that we haven't covered today?

1127
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Cat Allman:>Well I pontificated at length.

1128
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.290
<v Cat Allman:>So just to follow your passions.

1129
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Cat Allman:>At Maker Faires past, Google had a

1130
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.440
<v Cat Allman:>booth where we displayed people's personal projects

1131
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.939
<v Cat Allman:>as well as prototypes for things like

1132
00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.860
<v Cat Allman:>early Google Glass, etc.

1133
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Cat Allman:>And I would bring hyperbolic crochet, which

1134
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.379
<v Cat Allman:>you might say, what the heck is

1135
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.480
<v Cat Allman:>hyperbolic crochet?

1136
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:50.400
<v Cat Allman:>Well, it is crochet that models fractal

1137
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.280
<v Cat Allman:>equations in yarn.

1138
00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Cat Allman:>It was originally hit upon by a

1139
00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.920
<v Cat Allman:>math professor I think at the University

1140
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:03.839
<v Cat Allman:>of Chicago when she realized that her

1141
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:07.200
<v Cat Allman:>students couldn't visualize the results of fractal

1142
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.680
<v Cat Allman:>equations, and that then she figured out

1143
00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.760
<v Cat Allman:>that crochet would be the perfect way

1144
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:15.060
<v Cat Allman:>to build physical models of these rates

1145
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Cat Allman:>of growth.

1146
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.700
<v Cat Allman:>And from this, then two sisters, the

1147
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.180
<v Cat Allman:>Wertheim Sisters, started the Institute for Figuring,

1148
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Cat Allman:>talking about the intersection between handcrafts and

1149
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:29.880
<v Cat Allman:>mathematics.

1150
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Cat Allman:>So it's both a woman's studies project

1151
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.420
<v Cat Allman:>and a science project and a citizen

1152
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.440
<v Cat Allman:>science project.

1153
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.939
<v Cat Allman:>It's all over the world, including the

1154
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.820
<v Cat Allman:>Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington,

1155
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.360
<v Cat Allman:>D.C.

1156
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:50.340
<v Cat Allman:>There are assembled reefs, because coral reef,

1157
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.500
<v Cat Allman:>as in the ocean, as well as

1158
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:57.180
<v Cat Allman:>various kinds of plants, waterways, much of

1159
00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:02.580
<v Cat Allman:>life, grow in fractals, these repeating patterns

1160
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.620
<v Cat Allman:>of growth.

1161
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Cat Allman:>So, I crochet them out of nice

1162
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.839
<v Cat Allman:>soft squishy yarn and send them in

1163
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Cat Allman:>and they're assembled into these art projects.

1164
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.060
<v Cat Allman:>The most recent one I believe was

1165
00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Cat Allman:>in Hamburg.

1166
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.580
<v Cat Allman:>Beautiful stuff.

1167
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.879
<v Cat Allman:>So I bring this up because at

1168
00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.340
<v Cat Allman:>the Maker Faire there's soldering, and there's

1169
00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Cat Allman:>robots, and there's stuff that's on fire.

1170
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.800
<v Cat Allman:>And I had a probably three times

1171
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.759
<v Cat Allman:>size model of the human cerebellum in

1172
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Cat Allman:>crochet.

1173
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.400
<v Cat Allman:>So there was this big fuzzy squishy

1174
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Cat Allman:>object and not all women or little

1175
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.799
<v Cat Allman:>girls but sometimes other people would come

1176
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.319
<v Cat Allman:>through with their eyes glazed because they

1177
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.600
<v Cat Allman:>were tired of electronics and they would

1178
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.120
<v Cat Allman:>see yarn and they would get very

1179
00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Cat Allman:>excited.

1180
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.940
<v Cat Allman:>You could explain how it's like plants

1181
00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.779
<v Cat Allman:>grow, it's the way galaxies grow, you

1182
00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.820
<v Cat Allman:>can make it yourself, it's really easy

1183
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.779
<v Cat Allman:>and it's really impressive looking and it's

1184
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.740
<v Cat Allman:>soft and squishy.

1185
01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.580
<v Cat Allman:>So it's not coding.

1186
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.259
<v Cat Allman:>It's the simplest kind of math, but

1187
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.720
<v Cat Allman:>it's something that I really enjoy, and

1188
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.440
<v Cat Allman:>through it I was able to convince

1189
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.060
<v Cat Allman:>at least a handful of people that

1190
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.100
<v Cat Allman:>math isn't all scary.

1191
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.340
<v Cat Allman:>So do what you enjoy because life

1192
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.240
<v Cat Allman:>is short and you might as well

1193
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.760
<v Cat Allman:>have fun.

1194
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you Cat.

1195
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.799
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It's been a real pleasure talking to

1196
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.500
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you today.

1197
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.500
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.

1198
01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.420
<v Cat Allman:>Thank you.

1199
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Cat Allman:>I appreciate the opportunity to pontificate.

1200
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.480
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.
