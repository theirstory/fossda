00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.679
<v Elisabetta Mori:>It's the 8th of May, 2024.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And I am Elisabetta Mori, an historian

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.639
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of computing currently based in Italy, and

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>an oral history interview with Fosdem.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Today I'll be talking to Karen M

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Sandler.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Elisabetta Mori:>She's an attorney and the executive director

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>of Software Freedom Conservancy.

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Elisabetta Mori:>She is known as a cyber lawyer

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Elisabetta Mori:>for her advocacy for free software, particularly

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in relation to the software on medical

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Elisabetta Mori:>device.

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Elisabetta Mori:>She was the executive director of the

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Elisabetta Mori:>GNOME Foundation and the general counsel of

15
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the Software Freedom Law Center.

16
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Elisabetta Mori:>She's also a lecturer in law at

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Columbia University.

18
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>In 2023, she received an honorary doctorate

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>from Chi Leuven, Belgium.

20
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And we are recording under story io.

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Elisabetta Mori:>I am in Livorno, Tuscany, Italy and

22
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Karen is in the US.

23
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.279
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Okay.

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Can you can we start with, you

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Elisabetta Mori:>know, you describing your childhood, your family,

26
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Elisabetta Mori:>your first encounter with computers?

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Karen Sandler:>Sure.

28
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Karen Sandler:>I grew up in the suburbs in

29
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Karen Sandler:>the United States.

30
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.479
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, my parents had grown up very

31
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Karen Sandler:>poor.

32
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, they were the children of, uh,

33
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Karen Sandler:>parents who had fled persecution in Eastern

34
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.679
<v Karen Sandler:>Europe.

35
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Karen Sandler:>And so they had fled to the

36
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Karen Sandler:>United States, um, with nothing.

37
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and, uh, they, uh, they really

38
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Karen Sandler:>built this life for themselves.

39
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Karen Sandler:>And so they felt this big responsibility

40
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Karen Sandler:>growing up.

41
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.119
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and they had a real emphasis

42
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Karen Sandler:>on education and, um, making use of

43
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Karen Sandler:>all of the opportunities that were available

44
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Karen Sandler:>to us.

45
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.119
<v Karen Sandler:>My father was an engineer and my

46
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.869
<v Karen Sandler:>mother was a school teacher.

47
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Karen Sandler:>And so together, that made this real

48
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Karen Sandler:>atmosphere with a love of learning and,

49
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Karen Sandler:>um, really just it was a childhood

50
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.109
<v Karen Sandler:>where, uh, my mother, who was very

51
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.829
<v Karen Sandler:>interested in archaeology, would take me to

52
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Karen Sandler:>museums constantly and to lectures, and my

53
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.270
<v Karen Sandler:>father would take me to the planetarium

54
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Karen Sandler:>for lectures on astrophysics.

55
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, he was, uh, more of

56
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.549
<v Karen Sandler:>like an engineering scientist.

57
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Karen Sandler:>And so, uh, he was quite technical,

58
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Karen Sandler:>and he was one of the first

59
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Karen Sandler:>people using, uh, computer code in order

60
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Karen Sandler:>to, like, using computers to replace the,

61
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Karen Sandler:>um, the manual, um, crunching of numbers.

62
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Karen Sandler:>And so his big contribution to his

63
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.429
<v Karen Sandler:>field, he was an expert in vibrations,

64
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Karen Sandler:>was to write a computer program that

65
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Karen Sandler:>analyzed vibrations in different mediums.

66
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Karen Sandler:>And so when I was a little

67
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.549
<v Karen Sandler:>girl, he was constantly working on this

68
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.869
<v Karen Sandler:>program and on this, um, this analysis.

69
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was really fascinating to grow

70
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.429
<v Karen Sandler:>up with him around the house because

71
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Karen Sandler:>things like, um, you know, when I

72
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Karen Sandler:>was a little girl, I think he

73
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.430
<v Karen Sandler:>had already it was the very end

74
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Karen Sandler:>of computer punch cards being a thing.

75
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.109
<v Karen Sandler:>And so they had all of these

76
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.950
<v Karen Sandler:>computer punch cards that they didn't know

77
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Karen Sandler:>what to do with in his office.

78
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.630
<v Karen Sandler:>So he brought them home and they

79
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390
<v Karen Sandler:>were constantly all over the house.

80
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.630
<v Karen Sandler:>We used them to take notes when

81
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.270
<v Karen Sandler:>people called on the phone or to

82
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.989
<v Karen Sandler:>like, leave little messages for each other.

83
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I it's funny because, like,

84
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.830
<v Karen Sandler:>this was like an ever present part

85
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.109
<v Karen Sandler:>of my childhood.

86
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.430
<v Karen Sandler:>And I remember one of my earliest

87
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.429
<v Karen Sandler:>memories is going to his office with

88
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Karen Sandler:>him as a, as a, as a

89
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.829
<v Karen Sandler:>little girl and watching the punch cards

90
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Karen Sandler:>fly through the machine and seeing how

91
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Karen Sandler:>I used to imagine the way that

92
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Karen Sandler:>the punches looked were it looked like

93
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Karen Sandler:>animals to me, and I would imagine

94
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Karen Sandler:>the different animals moving.

95
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Karen Sandler:>And I remember, um, I must have

96
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.109
<v Karen Sandler:>been like, you know, 2 or 3.

97
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Karen Sandler:>And then, um, when I got even

98
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Karen Sandler:>a little older, um, you know, when

99
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.870
<v Karen Sandler:>I was four, we would play these

100
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Karen Sandler:>really like just old style video games

101
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.550
<v Karen Sandler:>in his office.

102
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.750
<v Karen Sandler:>And then of course, because he did

103
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.990
<v Karen Sandler:>this, he had computers in our house.

104
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Karen Sandler:>So I was very lucky that I

105
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.710
<v Karen Sandler:>had access to computers and learning how

106
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Karen Sandler:>to use them and, um, and playing

107
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.829
<v Karen Sandler:>games.

108
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Karen Sandler:>And I mean, I think I wrote

109
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.149
<v Karen Sandler:>my first really, really, really, really silly

110
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Karen Sandler:>program when I was probably six years

111
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Karen Sandler:>old, you know, or 5 or 6

112
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.229
<v Karen Sandler:>years old.

113
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, I, uh, I think maybe when

114
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.150
<v Karen Sandler:>I was seven, I was learning, uh,

115
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.590
<v Karen Sandler:>we learned the, the times tables at

116
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.909
<v Karen Sandler:>school, and it was a totally a

117
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Karen Sandler:>different time.

118
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Karen Sandler:>The teachers would say, oh, you know,

119
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.909
<v Karen Sandler:>we're going to do a quiz every

120
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.789
<v Karen Sandler:>day from this is Friday.

121
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Karen Sandler:>On Monday, we're going to start doing

122
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.390
<v Karen Sandler:>a quiz every day.

123
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Karen Sandler:>And as soon as you kids learn

124
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Karen Sandler:>like get 100% on this quiz, we'll

125
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Karen Sandler:>move your chair to the opposite side

126
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Karen Sandler:>of the room.

127
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Karen Sandler:>And I said, oh, that has to

128
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Karen Sandler:>be me.

129
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Karen Sandler:>I have to move to the other

130
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Karen Sandler:>side of the room.

131
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.310
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I went home and I

132
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.590
<v Karen Sandler:>wrote this little game to test myself

133
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Karen Sandler:>on playing, you know, my times tables.

134
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Karen Sandler:>And I played it all weekend.

135
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Karen Sandler:>I made a little Ascii rocket go

136
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Karen Sandler:>up the screen when I got it

137
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Karen Sandler:>right, and I loved it.

138
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Karen Sandler:>So it was really the first functional

139
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.349
<v Karen Sandler:>piece of code I ever wrote.

140
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Karen Sandler:>And then on Monday, I went to

141
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Karen Sandler:>school and I felt so bad.

142
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.870
<v Karen Sandler:>Like in retrospect, I remember the reactions

143
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Karen Sandler:>of the other kids because they just

144
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.789
<v Karen Sandler:>said, oh, you know, this is starting

145
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Karen Sandler:>on Monday.

146
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.909
<v Karen Sandler:>And they didn't think about it, but

147
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.789
<v Karen Sandler:>I got 100% on that because I

148
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Karen Sandler:>had practiced played that game all weekend.

149
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.469
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I moved to the other

150
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Karen Sandler:>side and it took it took a

151
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Karen Sandler:>couple of days for them to learn

152
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.309
<v Karen Sandler:>their times tables.

153
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.469
<v Karen Sandler:>So the other kids came over to

154
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.229
<v Karen Sandler:>the other side of the room.

155
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Karen Sandler:>But I remember it fondly because, you

156
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.229
<v Karen Sandler:>know, code coding was like, uh, it

157
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Karen Sandler:>was something that was fun, but it

158
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Karen Sandler:>was also something.

159
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.469
<v Karen Sandler:>It was a way that I could

160
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Karen Sandler:>do things that I wouldn't otherwise be

161
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Karen Sandler:>able to do.

162
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Karen Sandler:>And so that that was basically my.

163
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I grew up really, I

164
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Karen Sandler:>think really fortunately.

165
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.070
<v Karen Sandler:>And then my like I we were

166
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Karen Sandler:>we were talking before this, Elizabeth you

167
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Karen Sandler:>asked me like what was the first

168
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Karen Sandler:>computer that I remember, um, interacting.

169
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Karen Sandler:>And aside from the, I guess, the

170
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Karen Sandler:>the the punch card situation, the one

171
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Karen Sandler:>that I remember the most from when

172
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Karen Sandler:>I was little at home was we

173
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.420
<v Karen Sandler:>had this portable computer and it was

174
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Karen Sandler:>like this huge box with a teeny

175
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.980
<v Karen Sandler:>tiny, like greenish screen and black screen,

176
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.420
<v Karen Sandler:>and it had a big handle on

177
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.660
<v Karen Sandler:>it.

178
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.460
<v Karen Sandler:>So you could, like, carry it like

179
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Karen Sandler:>a huge suitcase.

180
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.700
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and so we used to, I,

181
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.900
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, that we used to, we

182
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Karen Sandler:>used to and the keyboard would like,

183
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Karen Sandler:>you could put the keyboard and attach

184
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.900
<v Karen Sandler:>it to the, um, to the computer.

185
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Karen Sandler:>So that was pretty cool.

186
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>That was pretty cool.

187
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.380
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Really?

188
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Yeah.

189
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>The portable, you know, they were portable.

190
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You could at least you could move

191
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>them because it's until at some point

192
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.900
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you couldn't move computer from the big

193
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>rooms they were in.

194
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.419
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So that was a big, a big,

195
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>uh, advancement.

196
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.460
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, um, what, uh, what about education?

197
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.659
<v Elisabetta Mori:>What about school?

198
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Which which schools and universities did you

199
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Elisabetta Mori:>attend?

200
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.380
<v Elisabetta Mori:>child?

201
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.700
<v Karen Sandler:>Well, when I was a kid, I

202
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.659
<v Karen Sandler:>just went to the the local public

203
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.140
<v Karen Sandler:>schools for elementary school and, uh, middle

204
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Karen Sandler:>school, although we called it junior high

205
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Karen Sandler:>then and, uh, high school and, um,

206
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Karen Sandler:>and then I went to a school

207
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Karen Sandler:>called Cooper Union for um, for undergraduate,

208
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.059
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, which is super special because it's

209
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Karen Sandler:>an in the United States, colleges are

210
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Karen Sandler:>very, very expensive.

211
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.219
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, it was one of the

212
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Karen Sandler:>it was the only school that was

213
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Karen Sandler:>completely, um, tuition free.

214
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Karen Sandler:>And so, um, and so I went

215
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.300
<v Karen Sandler:>there and it was amazing.

216
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.900
<v Karen Sandler:>It was, you know, founded by, like

217
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.500
<v Karen Sandler:>on the principle that, um, that tuition

218
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Karen Sandler:>should be as free as the air

219
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.900
<v Karen Sandler:>in the water.

220
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and it's interesting because Cooper

221
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.820
<v Karen Sandler:>Union was, um, at one point invited

222
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.820
<v Karen Sandler:>to become a part of Columbia University,

223
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Karen Sandler:>but because Cooper Union accepted women and

224
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Karen Sandler:>refused to stop accepting women, they couldn't.

225
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Karen Sandler:>They wouldn't be.

226
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.539
<v Karen Sandler:>They they decided not to join Columbia

227
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.539
<v Karen Sandler:>University, which is fascinating the way that

228
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.900
<v Karen Sandler:>the whole history thing went.

229
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Karen Sandler:>So that so that that happened then.

230
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Karen Sandler:>So yeah.

231
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.219
<v Karen Sandler:>So I went to Cooper Union, which

232
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.860
<v Karen Sandler:>is where, um, you know, previously there

233
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Karen Sandler:>was no formal computer related education in

234
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.620
<v Karen Sandler:>my, um, elementary school or my high

235
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.979
<v Karen Sandler:>school, no computer programming classes, nothing.

236
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and I basically had been doing

237
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.659
<v Karen Sandler:>a ton of, like, basic programming at

238
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Karen Sandler:>home, um, and just doing whatever I

239
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.300
<v Karen Sandler:>wanted.

240
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.980
<v Karen Sandler:>And then when I went to college,

241
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Karen Sandler:>it was very rigorous.

242
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Karen Sandler:>And because I'm old, um, the, uh,

243
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Karen Sandler:>the first class I had to take

244
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Karen Sandler:>in college was, uh, C and Fortran

245
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.419
<v Karen Sandler:>and Fortran because I went to engineering

246
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Karen Sandler:>school, um, back when again in the

247
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.659
<v Karen Sandler:>olden days.

248
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Karen Sandler:>And so it was very it was

249
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Karen Sandler:>it was really fun.

250
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Karen Sandler:>And that was like my first, um,

251
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.780
<v Karen Sandler:>introduction.

252
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.699
<v Karen Sandler:>And when I got to the school,

253
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.299
<v Karen Sandler:>the very first thing on the very

254
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Karen Sandler:>first day of my very first class

255
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Karen Sandler:>was to like, get an account in

256
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Karen Sandler:>the computer center, because of course, then

257
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Karen Sandler:>nobody had I, I had a really

258
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Karen Sandler:>like, ridiculous, like notebook computer, as they

259
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.740
<v Karen Sandler:>called them at the time, which, uh,

260
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.340
<v Karen Sandler:>which I felt very lucky to have

261
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Karen Sandler:>because nobody really had it, but it

262
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.260
<v Karen Sandler:>was a castoff from my, my dad,

263
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.660
<v Karen Sandler:>and it had like, uh, a teeny

264
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.859
<v Karen Sandler:>tiny amount of ram, like, ridiculously tiny.

265
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.180
<v Karen Sandler:>But you could you could use it

266
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Karen Sandler:>to, to, uh, to, you know, just

267
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.900
<v Karen Sandler:>to, to do, um, you know, text

268
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.819
<v Karen Sandler:>based things.

269
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.140
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I, I loved it and

270
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.860
<v Karen Sandler:>I had that at home, but, um,

271
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.420
<v Karen Sandler:>but nobody else had a computer, so

272
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.700
<v Karen Sandler:>you had to have, like, an account

273
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.500
<v Karen Sandler:>so you could use your, um, you

274
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Karen Sandler:>can, you can, um, you you had

275
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Karen Sandler:>your, your workstation and you could log

276
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Karen Sandler:>in.

277
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Karen Sandler:>So I went in to get my,

278
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, my account with another, um, woman

279
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.540
<v Karen Sandler:>who was in the class, uh, in

280
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Karen Sandler:>the incoming class with me.

281
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Karen Sandler:>And we went to the computer center.

282
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Karen Sandler:>And at the computer center, there were,

283
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Karen Sandler:>um, there were no women in the

284
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Karen Sandler:>computer center.

285
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.939
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was super weird because, uh,

286
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.500
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, there was actually a guy who

287
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.170
<v Karen Sandler:>had Ascii Keep porn on his workstation.

288
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.690
<v Karen Sandler:>And the friend that I was with,

289
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.690
<v Karen Sandler:>who was my new friend because it

290
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.890
<v Karen Sandler:>was the first day of college and

291
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Karen Sandler:>we didn't know each other very well,

292
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Karen Sandler:>said, I'm going to come back later.

293
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.209
<v Karen Sandler:>And she left, and I don't know

294
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.570
<v Karen Sandler:>what got into me because I'm very,

295
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.410
<v Karen Sandler:>very shy as a human being like.

296
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.810
<v Karen Sandler:>And I have some like I'm very

297
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.489
<v Karen Sandler:>reluctant to to I'm very conflict averse.

298
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, but for some reason I was

299
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.370
<v Karen Sandler:>full of boldness for my first day

300
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Karen Sandler:>of university.

301
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I went into the computer

302
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Karen Sandler:>center and I told the, um, Bob

303
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Karen Sandler:>Hopkins, who ran the computer center.

304
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.810
<v Karen Sandler:>I said to him, you know, it's

305
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Karen Sandler:>really gross out there.

306
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.050
<v Karen Sandler:>I don't know what you think is

307
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.890
<v Karen Sandler:>going on out there, but you probably

308
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Karen Sandler:>want to do something about it.

309
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Karen Sandler:>And he said, you're hired.

310
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.329
<v Karen Sandler:>I said, what?

311
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.290
<v Karen Sandler:>And he said, you know, like, you're

312
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Karen Sandler:>right, you're right.

313
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Karen Sandler:>You know, I want you to learn.

314
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.610
<v Karen Sandler:>And then he called in one of

315
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Karen Sandler:>the the guys who worked in the

316
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.569
<v Karen Sandler:>computer center, and he said, I want

317
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.970
<v Karen Sandler:>you to, like, just teach her everything.

318
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Karen Sandler:>You know.

319
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Karen Sandler:>I want her to have root as

320
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.970
<v Karen Sandler:>soon as possible.

321
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.370
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and so I, I worked

322
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.890
<v Karen Sandler:>in the computer center from the very

323
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.210
<v Karen Sandler:>beginning of my college, um, experience, and

324
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Karen Sandler:>that was truly amazing.

325
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Karen Sandler:>We installed Linux Labs and, um, and

326
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Karen Sandler:>it was really, you know, I mean,

327
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.290
<v Karen Sandler:>this is the 90s.

328
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.850
<v Karen Sandler:>So it was like really early stuff

329
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Karen Sandler:>and, um, and a ton of fun.

330
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Karen Sandler:>And Cooper Union, I got that whole

331
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.930
<v Karen Sandler:>free education.

332
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.330
<v Karen Sandler:>I cannot speak more highly.

333
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Karen Sandler:>I think that that was so transformative

334
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Karen Sandler:>for my career.

335
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.650
<v Karen Sandler:>And the fact that it was ideologically

336
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Karen Sandler:>founded really stuck with me.

337
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Karen Sandler:>I was not a principled person coming

338
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Karen Sandler:>into college.

339
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.850
<v Karen Sandler:>I didn't really think much about societal

340
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Karen Sandler:>society's problems, but the two have been

341
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Karen Sandler:>such a direct beneficiary of that.

342
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.050
<v Karen Sandler:>And actually, my father had gone to

343
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.010
<v Karen Sandler:>Cooper Union, too.

344
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and they they certainly could never

345
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Karen Sandler:>have afforded an education otherwise.

346
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.290
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, if he hadn't had.

347
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.089
<v Karen Sandler:>So the fact that that, um, that

348
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.650
<v Karen Sandler:>that happened and that had such an

349
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.770
<v Karen Sandler:>impact on my family has really stuck

350
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Karen Sandler:>with me.

351
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think that part of why

352
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Karen Sandler:>I'm so focused on public good now

353
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Karen Sandler:>is in part because of how grateful

354
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Karen Sandler:>I am for these structures that helped

355
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Karen Sandler:>me and my family succeed.

356
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what did you do after graduation?

357
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.810
<v Karen Sandler:>So after Cooper, I went straight to

358
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Karen Sandler:>law school at Columbia Law School.

359
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.770
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and I can't really give you

360
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.930
<v Karen Sandler:>a good reason why I did that.

361
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.370
<v Karen Sandler:>I really thought I was going to

362
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.210
<v Karen Sandler:>do physics grad school.

363
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.650
<v Karen Sandler:>But, uh, my, uh, my family was,

364
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.090
<v Karen Sandler:>was sort of, uh, pushing me towards

365
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.689
<v Karen Sandler:>the law.

366
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, just really to find a profession

367
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Karen Sandler:>that was more secure financially, which I

368
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.290
<v Karen Sandler:>totally respect.

369
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, I thought law could be

370
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.130
<v Karen Sandler:>interdisciplinary, and, um, it would be fun.

371
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.770
<v Karen Sandler:>So, um, I got into Columbia Law

372
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Karen Sandler:>School and I went there, which was

373
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Karen Sandler:>really great.

374
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.890
<v Karen Sandler:>I took a whole variety of classes.

375
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.170
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and, uh, and then when I

376
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.370
<v Karen Sandler:>graduated, I kind of fell into a

377
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Karen Sandler:>corporate law job.

378
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.810
<v Karen Sandler:>So they have, like, on campus interviewing,

379
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.210
<v Karen Sandler:>um, and all the law firms come

380
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Karen Sandler:>and they try to recruit.

381
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.970
<v Karen Sandler:>And at the time, the market was

382
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.930
<v Karen Sandler:>really booming.

383
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and so there were a lot

384
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.560
<v Karen Sandler:>of, um, of lucrative corporate opportunities.

385
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.760
<v Karen Sandler:>And as I said, I wasn't very

386
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Karen Sandler:>civic minded at the time.

387
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.880
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and I hadn't really thought too

388
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Karen Sandler:>much about, um, about doing any kind

389
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.400
<v Karen Sandler:>of public good work.

390
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.080
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, so I did all this on

391
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Karen Sandler:>campus interviewing, and one of the law

392
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.000
<v Karen Sandler:>firms said, if you come work for

393
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Karen Sandler:>us because it's a summer internship and

394
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.480
<v Karen Sandler:>then you get hired for the job

395
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Karen Sandler:>afterwards.

396
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Karen Sandler:>So if the summer internship is the

397
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.839
<v Karen Sandler:>big thing.

398
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Karen Sandler:>And so they said, if you come

399
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Karen Sandler:>work for us for your summer interview,

400
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Karen Sandler:>we'll let you spend half of the

401
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200
<v Karen Sandler:>summer in Hong Kong.

402
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Karen Sandler:>And I was like, you'll work in

403
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Karen Sandler:>our Hong Kong office.

404
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.560
<v Karen Sandler:>And I was like, yeah, like, I

405
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.760
<v Karen Sandler:>want to go to Hong Kong.

406
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.480
<v Karen Sandler:>So.

407
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.080
<v Karen Sandler:>So that's how I chose to become

408
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.319
<v Karen Sandler:>a securities lawyer.

409
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Karen Sandler:>I took that summer internship and I

410
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.600
<v Karen Sandler:>had such a good time doing it.

411
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.080
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, when I was in Hong Kong,

412
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Karen Sandler:>in the office, the law firm announced

413
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Karen Sandler:>that they were merging with an English

414
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880
<v Karen Sandler:>law firm called Clifford Chance, and they

415
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Karen Sandler:>were merging with a US law firm.

416
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.319
<v Karen Sandler:>And the people in the Hong Kong

417
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Karen Sandler:>office said, You don't really want to

418
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Karen Sandler:>work for those like we don't know

419
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Karen Sandler:>anything about that other law firm.

420
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.000
<v Karen Sandler:>They're, you know, they're doing their own

421
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.200
<v Karen Sandler:>thing.

422
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Karen Sandler:>You want to stay with us.

423
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Karen Sandler:>So we're going to recommend that you

424
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Karen Sandler:>start working in London.

425
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Karen Sandler:>And I was like, ooh, London sounds

426
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.479
<v Karen Sandler:>nice.

427
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.240
<v Karen Sandler:>So, uh, yeah.

428
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.680
<v Karen Sandler:>So I wound up starting my career

429
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.680
<v Karen Sandler:>in the London office of Clifford Chance

430
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.280
<v Karen Sandler:>as a cross-border securities lawyer doing transactional

431
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.760
<v Karen Sandler:>work.

432
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and that was great because

433
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.680
<v Karen Sandler:>I was able to bring my technical

434
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Karen Sandler:>background to help evaluate these all of

435
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.920
<v Karen Sandler:>these technological companies that were very large.

436
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.640
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, I really enjoyed it.

437
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Karen Sandler:>I moved back to the New York

438
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.320
<v Karen Sandler:>office, um, and the partner I worked

439
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.400
<v Karen Sandler:>for, uh, shifted over to another law

440
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Karen Sandler:>firm called Gibson Dunn, which was really

441
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.480
<v Karen Sandler:>fantastic.

442
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I switched over with him,

443
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.720
<v Karen Sandler:>and most of my clients were in

444
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Karen Sandler:>Brazil, and I really enjoyed that for

445
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Karen Sandler:>a while.

446
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.200
<v Karen Sandler:>And then I was sort of like,

447
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Karen Sandler:>ah, I don't really know.

448
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.120
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, like, this isn't really for me

449
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.199
<v Karen Sandler:>for the long term.

450
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.400
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and I was starting to reevaluate

451
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Karen Sandler:>my, um, my situation.

452
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.600
<v Karen Sandler:>And so, um, and so I was

453
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Karen Sandler:>one of the first people at the

454
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Karen Sandler:>law firm to quit with nothing lined

455
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.240
<v Karen Sandler:>up.

456
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.240
<v Karen Sandler:>It's like super common now, um, I

457
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.440
<v Karen Sandler:>think this is one of those being

458
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Karen Sandler:>an xennial kind of situations was that

459
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.880
<v Karen Sandler:>people didn't really do that before us,

460
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.400
<v Karen Sandler:>but, um, so I did that and

461
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Karen Sandler:>it was sort of, uh, um, it

462
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Karen Sandler:>was it caused a lot of like,

463
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Karen Sandler:>waves because people were talking about, oh,

464
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Karen Sandler:>did you hear that?

465
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Karen Sandler:>Karen quit with nothing lined up just

466
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.520
<v Karen Sandler:>because she was, you know, the partner

467
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.680
<v Karen Sandler:>I worked for was starting to use

468
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.360
<v Karen Sandler:>his political capital to help me make

469
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.080
<v Karen Sandler:>partner, and I just didn't want him

470
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.839
<v Karen Sandler:>to have to do that because I

471
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Karen Sandler:>knew I didn't want to make partner.

472
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Karen Sandler:>So I.

473
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Karen Sandler:>I gave a very long period of

474
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Karen Sandler:>notice.

475
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.920
<v Karen Sandler:>I let him choose.

476
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.360
<v Karen Sandler:>So I worked for six more months,

477
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Karen Sandler:>and then I was going to take

478
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.880
<v Karen Sandler:>a, I was going to take another

479
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.000
<v Karen Sandler:>six months off before I started looking

480
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Karen Sandler:>for a job.

481
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.040
<v Karen Sandler:>But then I heard that the Software

482
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.319
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Law Center was hiring.

483
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.880
<v Karen Sandler:>The founder, Eben Moglen, had, uh, been

484
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Karen Sandler:>my professor in law school, and so

485
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.560
<v Karen Sandler:>he asked me if I wanted to,

486
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.720
<v Karen Sandler:>apply there because he he knew I

487
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.640
<v Karen Sandler:>was technical and we had, um, you

488
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Karen Sandler:>know, I'd been in his class and

489
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Karen Sandler:>so that's how I wound up at

490
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.840
<v Karen Sandler:>the Software Freedom Law Center even before

491
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.760
<v Karen Sandler:>I wanted to start looking.

492
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.400
<v Karen Sandler:>So I got very, very, very lucky.

493
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Karen Sandler:>And I was someone who really thought

494
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.480
<v Karen Sandler:>that.

495
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Karen Sandler:>I really thought that open source was

496
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:49.960
<v Karen Sandler:>cool.

497
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Karen Sandler:>As I said, in college, I installed

498
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.200
<v Karen Sandler:>those Linux labs.

499
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.600
<v Karen Sandler:>I really thought that it was a

500
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Karen Sandler:>neat thing, but I did not think

501
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Karen Sandler:>that I, I didn't really think too

502
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.680
<v Karen Sandler:>much about the societal implications of it

503
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Karen Sandler:>or, or what it might mean for

504
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.200
<v Karen Sandler:>me, but I still felt so lucky

505
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.520
<v Karen Sandler:>to have landed in such a cool

506
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.040
<v Karen Sandler:>job.

507
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.640
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, um, this was 2005, 2006?

508
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.199
<v Karen Sandler:>Yeah, I think it was 2005.

509
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.599
<v Elisabetta Mori:>2005.

510
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.680
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And you work for the Software Freedom

511
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.760
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Law Center from 2005 to 2011?

512
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.920
<v Karen Sandler:>Well, it's such a neat job because

513
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Karen Sandler:>I met so many amazing developers and

514
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.670
<v Karen Sandler:>I heard from them, You know why

515
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.350
<v Karen Sandler:>they contributed?

516
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Karen Sandler:>Why they were so passionate about free

517
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.150
<v Karen Sandler:>and open source software.

518
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.670
<v Karen Sandler:>You know, whether it was the folks

519
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Karen Sandler:>that were, um, you know, really the

520
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.750
<v Karen Sandler:>the copyleft advocates, the folks working at

521
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.390
<v Karen Sandler:>the Free Software Foundation or people who

522
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.590
<v Karen Sandler:>were passionate about the collaboration component, like

523
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.910
<v Karen Sandler:>the folks that were my clients at

524
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.830
<v Karen Sandler:>the Apache Software Foundation.

525
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Karen Sandler:>And then, um, most interestingly, perhaps, was

526
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.430
<v Karen Sandler:>my where my clients like the ones,

527
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.590
<v Karen Sandler:>um, at X.Org, um, who were really

528
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.829
<v Karen Sandler:>when I met them, were very adamant

529
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.909
<v Karen Sandler:>about, um, being non-copyleft that permissive licensing

530
00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.430
<v Karen Sandler:>was an ideological choice.

531
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.710
<v Karen Sandler:>In other words, not trying to have,

532
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.109
<v Karen Sandler:>um, you know, making sure you don't

533
00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.790
<v Karen Sandler:>have that reciprocal component to the licensing.

534
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.790
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, who over the course of this,

535
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.350
<v Karen Sandler:>of my career that there's one developer

536
00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.670
<v Karen Sandler:>in particular, Keith Packard, who came completely

537
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.069
<v Karen Sandler:>around and now is a very strong

538
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Karen Sandler:>copyleft advocate because he was burned so

539
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Karen Sandler:>many times, um, from having his code

540
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.030
<v Karen Sandler:>be, uh, be proprietary.

541
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.670
<v Karen Sandler:>So it's really, really fascinating.

542
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Karen Sandler:>But hearing from those developers directly about

543
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.990
<v Karen Sandler:>their legal problems, helping them, incorporating their

544
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.350
<v Karen Sandler:>organizations, becoming like a really big part

545
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.390
<v Karen Sandler:>of their organization, um, and what they

546
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Karen Sandler:>were doing meant that I got to

547
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Karen Sandler:>I got to learn why they were

548
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.270
<v Karen Sandler:>doing it.

549
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.590
<v Karen Sandler:>And um, and the philosophy and it

550
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.110
<v Karen Sandler:>really started to sink in.

551
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.510
<v Karen Sandler:>And then while I was at the

552
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.150
<v Karen Sandler:>Software Freedom Law Center, I found out

553
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.229
<v Karen Sandler:>that I had a heart condition that

554
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.270
<v Karen Sandler:>I was born with.

555
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.750
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, it's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

556
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.270
<v Karen Sandler:>It means that I have a big

557
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Karen Sandler:>and really thick heart, but it's like,

558
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.430
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, mine is particularly thick.

559
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.750
<v Karen Sandler:>It's, uh, it's like about three times

560
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Karen Sandler:>the size of parts of it are

561
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.189
<v Karen Sandler:>about three times the size of a

562
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.950
<v Karen Sandler:>normal person's heart.

563
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was totally fine.

564
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.470
<v Karen Sandler:>I didn't have any symptoms.

565
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.910
<v Karen Sandler:>I happened to find out about it

566
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Karen Sandler:>somewhat accidentally because I was getting migraine

567
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Karen Sandler:>headaches.

568
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Karen Sandler:>Neurologists, they heard I had a murmur.

569
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.390
<v Karen Sandler:>Anyway, so I found out about my

570
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.790
<v Karen Sandler:>heart condition In and um, and the,

571
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.070
<v Karen Sandler:>the main thing about it was that

572
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Karen Sandler:>I needed to get an implanted pacemaker

573
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Karen Sandler:>defibrillator just for the defibrillator part so

574
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Karen Sandler:>that, um, because I was at a

575
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Karen Sandler:>very high risk of sudden death.

576
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Karen Sandler:>And so, um, like, being technical and

577
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.830
<v Karen Sandler:>being diagnosed with this condition and knowing

578
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.270
<v Karen Sandler:>that I need to, to get a

579
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.030
<v Karen Sandler:>device, it made me research the device.

580
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.310
<v Karen Sandler:>And I really wanted to learn about

581
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.670
<v Karen Sandler:>the software on the device.

582
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Karen Sandler:>And I hit a complete dead end

583
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.150
<v Karen Sandler:>in my research where, um, the companies

584
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.150
<v Karen Sandler:>had were not able to share any

585
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Karen Sandler:>of the information with me to help

586
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.630
<v Karen Sandler:>me understand how my own defibrillator would

587
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Karen Sandler:>work.

588
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.710
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was funny because talking to

589
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.870
<v Karen Sandler:>the doctors, um, you know, just I

590
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.189
<v Karen Sandler:>just asked them, you know, what do

591
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.389
<v Karen Sandler:>you know?

592
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.430
<v Karen Sandler:>What can you tell me about the

593
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.510
<v Karen Sandler:>software in this device?

594
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.070
<v Karen Sandler:>And my the first electrophysiologist I had,

595
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.590
<v Karen Sandler:>his response was software.

596
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Karen Sandler:>Like, what are you talking about?

597
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.990
<v Karen Sandler:>And I explained, this device is run

598
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Karen Sandler:>by like there's software on the device.

599
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Karen Sandler:>It's critical to how it operates.

600
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.949
<v Karen Sandler:>And he had he had no idea.

601
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Karen Sandler:>He was like, no, it just works.

602
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.870
<v Karen Sandler:>He's like, no, there's there's details here

603
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Karen Sandler:>you probably should worry about.

604
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.669
<v Karen Sandler:>And then, um, he called the, you

605
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.629
<v Karen Sandler:>know, the device representative, the technician, the

606
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.389
<v Karen Sandler:>tech representative who was there at the

607
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Karen Sandler:>moment.

608
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.389
<v Karen Sandler:>I got lucky in the office and

609
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Karen Sandler:>that representative said software.

610
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Karen Sandler:>So it was this funny, like, you

611
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Karen Sandler:>know, it was a long time ago

612
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.790
<v Karen Sandler:>and, um, I think people hadn't really

613
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Karen Sandler:>thought very much about software.

614
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.030
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I was, I think the

615
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.430
<v Karen Sandler:>introduction to these issues, uh, the electrophysiologist

616
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Karen Sandler:>that I was working with, got so

617
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.510
<v Karen Sandler:>upset when I started to explain the

618
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Karen Sandler:>things that could go wrong with software

619
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Karen Sandler:>that, um, and why I was so

620
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Karen Sandler:>nervous about it.

621
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.110
<v Karen Sandler:>This is on a follow up phone

622
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Karen Sandler:>call, and I explained why I really

623
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Karen Sandler:>wanted this information.

624
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, he got so upset that

625
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.630
<v Karen Sandler:>he hung up on me because he

626
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.830
<v Karen Sandler:>implanted, you know, sometimes multiple defibrillators on

627
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.790
<v Karen Sandler:>a single day.

628
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.980
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think the idea of anyone

629
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.020
<v Karen Sandler:>asking questions about its safety and efficacy

630
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.939
<v Karen Sandler:>implied that somehow he wasn't doing a

631
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.620
<v Karen Sandler:>good job.

632
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.740
<v Karen Sandler:>But, you know, it was a really

633
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.979
<v Karen Sandler:>interesting education for me.

634
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.620
<v Karen Sandler:>It was a very bleak moment and

635
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.580
<v Karen Sandler:>very upsetting.

636
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.180
<v Karen Sandler:>But, um, but I realized that the

637
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.379
<v Karen Sandler:>way we think about software as human

638
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.180
<v Karen Sandler:>beings and as professionals is, is, is

639
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.540
<v Karen Sandler:>really different than the way that the

640
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.900
<v Karen Sandler:>technology actually works and what we can

641
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Karen Sandler:>rely on.

642
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Karen Sandler:>So I really thought that, um, I

643
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.620
<v Karen Sandler:>became really passionate and really convinced that

644
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Karen Sandler:>we need to be able to audit

645
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.540
<v Karen Sandler:>the software.

646
00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Karen Sandler:>We rely on the idea that there

647
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Karen Sandler:>would be software in my body, implanted

648
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Karen Sandler:>in my body, and screwed into my

649
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.699
<v Karen Sandler:>heart was and that I wouldn't be

650
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.940
<v Karen Sandler:>able to see it was just completely

651
00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.419
<v Karen Sandler:>baffling, just completely baffling.

652
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.899
<v Karen Sandler:>And so it caused me to really

653
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.260
<v Karen Sandler:>advocate for the transparency of these devices.

654
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.260
<v Karen Sandler:>I wrote a paper.

655
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, you know, I started doing, uh,

656
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.179
<v Karen Sandler:>other work.

657
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.300
<v Karen Sandler:>I filed Freedom of Information Act requests

658
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.380
<v Karen Sandler:>with the medical device manufacturers to see

659
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:34.900
<v Karen Sandler:>what I could find.

660
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.980
<v Karen Sandler:>I mostly hit brick walls, but the

661
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.620
<v Karen Sandler:>advocacy component was really important.

662
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.860
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um.

663
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.620
<v Karen Sandler:>And as I lived with my defibrillator,

664
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.940
<v Karen Sandler:>I, um, I had other circumstances that

665
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Karen Sandler:>made me realize that it wasn't just

666
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Karen Sandler:>about transparency, so.

667
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.699
<v Karen Sandler:>So I did all this work at

668
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.700
<v Karen Sandler:>the Software Freedom Law Center.

669
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
<v Karen Sandler:>I know you're trying to get some

670
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Karen Sandler:>narrative of my my timeline here.

671
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.620
<v Karen Sandler:>So so I kept working at the

672
00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Karen Sandler:>Software Freedom Law Center.

673
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Karen Sandler:>I became general counsel there.

674
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.420
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and, um, I still provided legal

675
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.700
<v Karen Sandler:>advice to the clients of the Software

676
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.939
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Law Center, which were really amazing

677
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.780
<v Karen Sandler:>organizations in and of themselves.

678
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.380
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and over time, um, one

679
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Karen Sandler:>of those clients recruited me to be

680
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.780
<v Karen Sandler:>their executive director.

681
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.180
<v Karen Sandler:>So I went over to the GNOME

682
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Karen Sandler:>Foundation, and GNOME is, um, is desktop

683
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.380
<v Karen Sandler:>software.

684
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Karen Sandler:>So if you're running a Linux machine.

685
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.340
<v Karen Sandler:>The most common desktop is GNOME, and

686
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.740
<v Karen Sandler:>so they had just launched GNOME three,

687
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.340
<v Karen Sandler:>which was this.

688
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Karen Sandler:>Really it's the it's the format of

689
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Karen Sandler:>GNOME now and it's just really shiny

690
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.580
<v Karen Sandler:>and beautiful.

691
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Karen Sandler:>And they needed someone to come in

692
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.260
<v Karen Sandler:>and and help push the foundation forward.

693
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.699
<v Karen Sandler:>And so they recruited me.

694
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.260
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I went over there and

695
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.899
<v Karen Sandler:>um, and while I was working at

696
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Karen Sandler:>the Gnome Foundation, I had, um, I

697
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.100
<v Karen Sandler:>was pregnant and I was set to

698
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.060
<v Karen Sandler:>have, um, to have a baby.

699
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.300
<v Karen Sandler:>And while I was pregnant, my heart

700
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.060
<v Karen Sandler:>palpitated, which happens to about like a

701
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.340
<v Karen Sandler:>third of all pregnant people, there's like,

702
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.580
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, a third of all pregnancies.

703
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Karen Sandler:>You or maybe something like that.

704
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.460
<v Karen Sandler:>It's super, super common.

705
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, your heart, like, beats a little

706
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.100
<v Karen Sandler:>bit faster, has palpitations.

707
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, when I give this talk in

708
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Karen Sandler:>a whole room, all the women are

709
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Karen Sandler:>usually, like, nodding their heads.

710
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and it would be fine if

711
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.699
<v Karen Sandler:>you were pregnant and went to the

712
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.340
<v Karen Sandler:>doctor and said.

713
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.420
<v Karen Sandler:>I've had my heart beating.

714
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:20.660
<v Karen Sandler:>Funny.

715
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Karen Sandler:>They'll say, oh, you're pregnant, it's palpitations.

716
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.410
<v Karen Sandler:>Let us know if you pass out

717
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.889
<v Karen Sandler:>or if you feel lightheaded.

718
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Karen Sandler:>Right.

719
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.530
<v Karen Sandler:>And none of those things happen to

720
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.889
<v Karen Sandler:>me except that I had a defibrillator.

721
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Karen Sandler:>And my defibrillator thought my heart was

722
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Karen Sandler:>in a dangerous rhythm.

723
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.050
<v Karen Sandler:>And even though I didn't need it

724
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.170
<v Karen Sandler:>to, it shocked me unnecessarily.

725
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.170
<v Karen Sandler:>Repeatedly.

726
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.170
<v Karen Sandler:>And the only way I could get

727
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.970
<v Karen Sandler:>it to stop shocking me was to

728
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Karen Sandler:>take medication that slowed my heart rate

729
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Karen Sandler:>down so much that it was hard

730
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.290
<v Karen Sandler:>to climb up a flight of stairs.

731
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.250
<v Karen Sandler:>And being pregnant was a temporary condition.

732
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Karen Sandler:>I've done it twice.

733
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Karen Sandler:>The babies are fine.

734
00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.530
<v Karen Sandler:>Like it all worked out great.

735
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.530
<v Karen Sandler:>But I it was really, really eye

736
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Karen Sandler:>opening because it really stood for the

737
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Karen Sandler:>proposition that our technology may not be

738
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.890
<v Karen Sandler:>made for us.

739
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:14.490
<v Karen Sandler:>Device manufacturers desperately don't want pregnant patients

740
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.290
<v Karen Sandler:>getting shocked.

741
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Karen Sandler:>What a nightmare that is.

742
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.889
<v Karen Sandler:>Definitely not what they want.

743
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.290
<v Karen Sandler:>But only 15% of defibrillators go to

744
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.130
<v Karen Sandler:>people under the age of 65.

745
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.770
<v Karen Sandler:>So the number of people who are

746
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.570
<v Karen Sandler:>pregnant with defibrillators are teeny, teeny, teeny

747
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.129
<v Karen Sandler:>tiny.

748
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.649
<v Karen Sandler:>So yeah.

749
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.330
<v Karen Sandler:>So that's you know, it just stands

750
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.610
<v Karen Sandler:>for the proposition of like our technology

751
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.690
<v Karen Sandler:>may not be made for us.

752
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.130
<v Karen Sandler:>And what will we do when it

753
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:38.770
<v Karen Sandler:>fails?

754
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Karen Sandler:>So, um.

755
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Karen Sandler:>Yeah, that's, uh.

756
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.490
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Yes.

757
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.969
<v Karen Sandler:>Your story puts us on mute for

758
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.410
<v Karen Sandler:>one second.

759
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.050
<v Karen Sandler:>I'm sorry.

760
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.410
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So your story made me, uh, you

761
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.530
<v Elisabetta Mori:>know, at the beginning, we discussed also,

762
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.649
<v Elisabetta Mori:>this made me think of, um, Marimo,

763
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Elisabetta Mori:>who, you know, and wrote also a

764
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.690
<v Elisabetta Mori:>nice article with about her pacemaker and

765
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.889
<v Elisabetta Mori:>how her, as a someone who is

766
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:08.050
<v Elisabetta Mori:>an expert in cybersecurity, realized how, you

767
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.610
<v Elisabetta Mori:>know, uh, vulnerable she was by having

768
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.610
<v Elisabetta Mori:>some medical implants.

769
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.530
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Um, so This is make me making

770
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.690
<v Elisabetta Mori:>me think also a lot about.

771
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.810
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So this was something that happened to

772
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.850
<v Elisabetta Mori:>you in 2006.

773
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.890
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Now almost 20 years have passed.

774
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Elisabetta Mori:>How do you see, uh, everything around

775
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.250
<v Elisabetta Mori:>around implanted medical devices.

776
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:41.970
<v Elisabetta Mori:>About.

777
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Around what?

778
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.610
<v Elisabetta Mori:>You, as you call yourself cyborg.

779
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So what's the current state?

780
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Karen Sandler:>So it's so the defibrillator.

781
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.689
<v Karen Sandler:>I got that 20 years ago, but

782
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Karen Sandler:>the pregnancy happened later.

783
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.129
<v Karen Sandler:>So it's been this like.

784
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.929
<v Karen Sandler:>And so it's a really fascinating to

785
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.449
<v Karen Sandler:>me is that I previously thought it

786
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.410
<v Karen Sandler:>was only about transparency and auditability.

787
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.010
<v Karen Sandler:>Then I realized that it was all

788
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Karen Sandler:>about, um, control.

789
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Karen Sandler:>And you know, who has control over

790
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.209
<v Karen Sandler:>the software that is that we, that

791
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.330
<v Karen Sandler:>we fundamentally rely on, right.

792
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.090
<v Karen Sandler:>And then, um, and then most recently

793
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.129
<v Karen Sandler:>last year, as is typical with my

794
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Karen Sandler:>heart condition, I wound up getting an

795
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.290
<v Karen Sandler:>irregular heartbeat.

796
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.410
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, it happened to my dad from

797
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.210
<v Karen Sandler:>when he was 32.

798
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Karen Sandler:>I was a little older.

799
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.170
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, but it's quite common.

800
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.490
<v Karen Sandler:>And all of a sudden, I needed

801
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.490
<v Karen Sandler:>to know when I got an irregular

802
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Karen Sandler:>rhythm and if it was safe to

803
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.250
<v Karen Sandler:>travel because I had an important trip.

804
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.850
<v Karen Sandler:>I was getting an honorary doctorate from

805
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.610
<v Karen Sandler:>Calvin, and I really didn't want to

806
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.570
<v Karen Sandler:>miss that, because that's kind of a

807
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Karen Sandler:>once in a lifetime thing.

808
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Karen Sandler:>But I got this irregular rhythm and

809
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.770
<v Karen Sandler:>had to travel two days later.

810
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.129
<v Karen Sandler:>And do you know that because the

811
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Karen Sandler:>device manufacturers representative was out of town

812
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.970
<v Karen Sandler:>visiting family in India and they did

813
00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.050
<v Karen Sandler:>not have an alternate person, I could

814
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.090
<v Karen Sandler:>not get my defibrillator interrogated.

815
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.450
<v Karen Sandler:>And all of this major metropolitan city

816
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Karen Sandler:>that I live in, wild stuff.

817
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.850
<v Karen Sandler:>And I have this defibrillator, um, in

818
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.370
<v Karen Sandler:>particular, because while it's, um, it's a

819
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.850
<v Karen Sandler:>large defibrillator in.

820
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.120
<v Karen Sandler:>Sorry, it's a large manufacturer in Europe.

821
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.879
<v Karen Sandler:>It's, um, it has a much smaller

822
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.159
<v Karen Sandler:>imprint in the United States, but I

823
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.680
<v Karen Sandler:>use them because, um, these devices are

824
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.960
<v Karen Sandler:>totally interference.

825
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.480
<v Karen Sandler:>They can be, um, you know, they

826
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.400
<v Karen Sandler:>they researchers have shown that they can

827
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.919
<v Karen Sandler:>be, um, you can run their batteries

828
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Karen Sandler:>down.

829
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Karen Sandler:>You can have them shock unnecessarily because

830
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Karen Sandler:>they're all broadcasting remotely.

831
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.080
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and the encryption on these

832
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.840
<v Karen Sandler:>devices has historically been terrible.

833
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.160
<v Karen Sandler:>There have been improvements lately, but, uh,

834
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.200
<v Karen Sandler:>but really just awful stuff.

835
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I found this one manufacturer

836
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.679
<v Karen Sandler:>where you could disable the, the broadcasting

837
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.840
<v Karen Sandler:>and software and the, the others all

838
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.920
<v Karen Sandler:>just stay broadcasting consistently.

839
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Karen Sandler:>So at least with my defibrillator, you

840
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.399
<v Karen Sandler:>have to they call it like a

841
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.080
<v Karen Sandler:>programmer.

842
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.440
<v Karen Sandler:>You have to at least be right

843
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Karen Sandler:>on top of me in order to

844
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.120
<v Karen Sandler:>read it, and I'll be able to

845
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.399
<v Karen Sandler:>see it, whereas with all of the

846
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Karen Sandler:>other ones, or if or if this

847
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600
<v Karen Sandler:>one, if you enable the, um, the

848
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.520
<v Karen Sandler:>radio telemetry, you could be all the

849
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.240
<v Karen Sandler:>way across the street.

850
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.040
<v Karen Sandler:>And as I said, I live in

851
00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.560
<v Karen Sandler:>a major city.

852
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.040
<v Karen Sandler:>So like it's so densely packed, the

853
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.000
<v Karen Sandler:>person could be anywhere and interfere with

854
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Karen Sandler:>these devices.

855
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Karen Sandler:>So I need this manufacturer.

856
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.560
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and we may get to the

857
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Karen Sandler:>fact that I run a diversity initiative,

858
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.520
<v Karen Sandler:>um, for folks subject to systemic bias,

859
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.920
<v Karen Sandler:>but because of some of my work,

860
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Karen Sandler:>it makes some people very angry.

861
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think just being a very

862
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Karen Sandler:>prominently like just a prominent woman in

863
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.120
<v Karen Sandler:>technology, it means that, um, I have

864
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.199
<v Karen Sandler:>a lot of unpleasant experiences, which includes,

865
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, people, uh, who want to enter,

866
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.680
<v Karen Sandler:>like who I've got.

867
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.320
<v Karen Sandler:>I'll just say I've gotten rape and

868
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:44.920
<v Karen Sandler:>death threats.

869
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.920
<v Karen Sandler:>And so it's not theoretical to be

870
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.120
<v Karen Sandler:>worried about somebody interfering with my defibrillator.

871
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120
<v Karen Sandler:>So I really needed to get the

872
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.520
<v Karen Sandler:>device.

873
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.320
<v Karen Sandler:>However, it meant that I'm beholden to

874
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Karen Sandler:>this one company.

875
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.479
<v Karen Sandler:>None of these devices are interoperable.

876
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.560
<v Karen Sandler:>You can't use the interrogator from one

877
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Karen Sandler:>device to read the information off of

878
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.840
<v Karen Sandler:>another.

879
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.439
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I was completely unable to

880
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Karen Sandler:>get the information off of my defibrillator

881
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720
<v Karen Sandler:>in my own city.

882
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.199
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and then I was in

883
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Karen Sandler:>Belgium for the, um, for the honorary

884
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.240
<v Karen Sandler:>doctorate, and I was able to go

885
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.640
<v Karen Sandler:>to a Brussels hospital, and they were

886
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.239
<v Karen Sandler:>able to interrogate my device and get

887
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.199
<v Karen Sandler:>the information off.

888
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.280
<v Karen Sandler:>But it was just this horrifying moment

889
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.640
<v Karen Sandler:>of being so helpless because not only

890
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Karen Sandler:>could I not see the code in

891
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.080
<v Karen Sandler:>my own body, not only could I

892
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.719
<v Karen Sandler:>have no control over it when it

893
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.040
<v Karen Sandler:>was, uh, when it was inappropriately shocking

894
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.040
<v Karen Sandler:>me and I needed to take unnecessary

895
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.720
<v Karen Sandler:>medication to stop that.

896
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.800
<v Karen Sandler:>But also, I couldn't get the very

897
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.639
<v Karen Sandler:>information that I needed to make really

898
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.120
<v Karen Sandler:>important choices about whether it was safe

899
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Karen Sandler:>for me to travel or how it

900
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.240
<v Karen Sandler:>was safe for me to live my

901
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:50.720
<v Karen Sandler:>life.

902
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Karen Sandler:>So, you know, having this, it's been

903
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.370
<v Karen Sandler:>like every I'd say like 5 to

904
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.160
<v Karen Sandler:>7 years.

905
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.160
<v Karen Sandler:>There's like some other major lesson in

906
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.320
<v Karen Sandler:>technology that I'm learning from living with

907
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Karen Sandler:>this defibrillator.

908
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.879
<v Karen Sandler:>And now I have a second.

909
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.760
<v Karen Sandler:>So this is my second defibrillator.

910
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Karen Sandler:>The first one lasts to ten years.

911
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.120
<v Karen Sandler:>My current defibrillator, they predict to live

912
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.960
<v Karen Sandler:>17 years to exist for 17 years.

913
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.160
<v Karen Sandler:>And when you think about the life

914
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.040
<v Karen Sandler:>of our technology, 17 years is such

915
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.040
<v Karen Sandler:>a long time.

916
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Karen Sandler:>We don't even know what the world

917
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Karen Sandler:>will be like in 17 years, let

918
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Karen Sandler:>alone, I mean, much of our technology

919
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.320
<v Karen Sandler:>becomes obsolete in just a couple of

920
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:24.879
<v Karen Sandler:>years.

921
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.080
<v Karen Sandler:>So the idea that we're making these

922
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.199
<v Karen Sandler:>choices that we're going to have to

923
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.640
<v Karen Sandler:>live with societally for a long time

924
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.440
<v Karen Sandler:>is really important.

925
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Karen Sandler:>And at the same time, I realized

926
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.760
<v Karen Sandler:>that this technology that is sewn into

927
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.280
<v Karen Sandler:>my body is a metaphor for all

928
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.639
<v Karen Sandler:>of the other software we rely on.

929
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.560
<v Karen Sandler:>It's not really about medical devices so

930
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.400
<v Karen Sandler:>much as it's about everything that is

931
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.440
<v Karen Sandler:>critical in our society, whether it's our

932
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.960
<v Karen Sandler:>stock markets, our, um, you know, our

933
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Karen Sandler:>basic infrastructure, uh, the, the stuff we

934
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.240
<v Karen Sandler:>rely on to educate, um, our kids

935
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Karen Sandler:>like our, our, our, you know, technology

936
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Karen Sandler:>that we use for our banking and

937
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Karen Sandler:>for, uh, and for our basic communications,

938
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.360
<v Karen Sandler:>like, and we're combining everything with everything

939
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.439
<v Karen Sandler:>else, and we're only as safe as

940
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Karen Sandler:>our weakest link.

941
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.429
<v Karen Sandler:>So I'd say that all of the

942
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Karen Sandler:>things that I talked about, it's now

943
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.229
<v Karen Sandler:>almost 20 years ago, I thought a

944
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Karen Sandler:>lot of what I said felt really,

945
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.030
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, theoretical and space agey.

946
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.910
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and it felt like it was

947
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.790
<v Karen Sandler:>very unlikely for that to, I don't

948
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.790
<v Karen Sandler:>know, it just felt so theoretical.

949
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.910
<v Karen Sandler:>Every passing year becomes the reality of

950
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.469
<v Karen Sandler:>what we live in, and every year

951
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Karen Sandler:>it becomes more and more critical that

952
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Karen Sandler:>we take control over our society, of

953
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.350
<v Karen Sandler:>our software as a society.

954
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Karen Sandler:>And unfortunately, what's happened is that over

955
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.429
<v Karen Sandler:>time, while we have more open source,

956
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Karen Sandler:>the more open source and everything, there's

957
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.790
<v Karen Sandler:>Foss, you know, there's the Linux kernel

958
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.350
<v Karen Sandler:>is in everything.

959
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Karen Sandler:>It's in refrigerators and toasters.

960
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Karen Sandler:>And, you know, we use it.

961
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.629
<v Karen Sandler:>You can no one would ever imagine

962
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.070
<v Karen Sandler:>launching a business without using free and

963
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Karen Sandler:>open source software that economists just valued

964
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.949
<v Karen Sandler:>it at a ridiculously huge at at

965
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Karen Sandler:>a, at a value that is more

966
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.389
<v Karen Sandler:>than, um, than the value of Microsoft

967
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.110
<v Karen Sandler:>for example.

968
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Karen Sandler:>So by a lot.

969
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.510
<v Karen Sandler:>And so like it's so critical.

970
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Karen Sandler:>But the freedom we have the choice

971
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.790
<v Karen Sandler:>the you know, the control over our

972
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.550
<v Karen Sandler:>technology is so much less than what

973
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Karen Sandler:>we've ever had before.

974
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.189
<v Karen Sandler:>It is near impossible to get along,

975
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Karen Sandler:>like to replace the software on any

976
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Karen Sandler:>device that you own.

977
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.350
<v Karen Sandler:>It's impossible to repair the software on

978
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Karen Sandler:>devices that you own.

979
00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.989
<v Karen Sandler:>And our ability as a society to

980
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.310
<v Karen Sandler:>move from one product to another is

981
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.990
<v Karen Sandler:>almost negligible.

982
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Karen Sandler:>It's, um, astounding to me at this

983
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.270
<v Karen Sandler:>very moment.

984
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.830
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, just recently in the United States,

985
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Karen Sandler:>the United States passed a nonpartisan, bipartisan

986
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.710
<v Karen Sandler:>bill to, uh, to require the sale

987
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.870
<v Karen Sandler:>of, of of TikTok in the United

988
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.870
<v Karen Sandler:>States to a US entity which solves

989
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.909
<v Karen Sandler:>none of the problems that, you know,

990
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.629
<v Karen Sandler:>like, it doesn't actually create any ethical

991
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.150
<v Karen Sandler:>technology.

992
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.750
<v Karen Sandler:>So people are waking up to this

993
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Karen Sandler:>idea that there's a problem with our

994
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Karen Sandler:>technology and that we need to be,

995
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:06.870
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, we need to be doing

996
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Karen Sandler:>things differently.

997
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Karen Sandler:>But they they don't know how yet.

998
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Karen Sandler:>And what we need is software freedom.

999
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.790
<v Karen Sandler:>What we need is decentralization.

1000
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Karen Sandler:>What we need is encryption.

1001
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.750
<v Karen Sandler:>But these problems are hard and they

1002
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.909
<v Karen Sandler:>require activity on a mass level.

1003
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Karen Sandler:>We need to have a lot of

1004
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.910
<v Karen Sandler:>group like group collective action.

1005
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.310
<v Karen Sandler:>And that is that that takes that

1006
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.990
<v Karen Sandler:>takes work and that takes money, and

1007
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.909
<v Karen Sandler:>it takes the inconvenience of the business

1008
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.550
<v Karen Sandler:>models of companies in the tech sector,

1009
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.670
<v Karen Sandler:>all of which are.

1010
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.870
<v Karen Sandler:>So I would say, like if you're

1011
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.590
<v Karen Sandler:>asking me how I feel about it

1012
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.990
<v Karen Sandler:>now, with respect to looking back, I'd

1013
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.550
<v Karen Sandler:>say I am more right than I

1014
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.590
<v Karen Sandler:>ever wanted to be.

1015
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, which really saddens me.

1016
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.350
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, and the state of our

1017
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.469
<v Karen Sandler:>technology is so much worse than I

1018
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Karen Sandler:>expected it would be now.

1019
00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Karen Sandler:>But at the same time, I have

1020
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Karen Sandler:>so much more hope than I've ever

1021
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.429
<v Karen Sandler:>had before, because I think that people

1022
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.540
<v Karen Sandler:>are starting to get the fact that

1023
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Karen Sandler:>something's wrong and they're understand the fact

1024
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.420
<v Karen Sandler:>that our technology is so important that

1025
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.540
<v Karen Sandler:>we can't just sit by and let

1026
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Karen Sandler:>companies subjugate our own digital rights to

1027
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.140
<v Karen Sandler:>their quarterly profits.

1028
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.

1029
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.659
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, um, let's go back to the

1030
00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.660
<v Elisabetta Mori:>time you were working for the Gnome

1031
00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:28.620
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Foundation.

1032
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:34.860
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Um, in 2012, you got married, but

1033
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.020
<v Elisabetta Mori:>at the same time, another important activity

1034
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Elisabetta Mori:>there was, like, you also worked, uh,

1035
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Elisabetta Mori:>at gnome, uh, in the outreach program

1036
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.339
<v Elisabetta Mori:>for women.

1037
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.580
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So, uh, can you talk about those

1038
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.219
<v Elisabetta Mori:>years and, um, what brought you to

1039
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.259
<v Elisabetta Mori:>work for the Software Freedom Conservancy a

1040
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260
<v Elisabetta Mori:>few years later?

1041
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.860
<v Karen Sandler:>So the GNOME actually started outreach program

1042
00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Karen Sandler:>for women when I was at the

1043
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Karen Sandler:>Software Freedom Law Center, and they asked

1044
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.299
<v Karen Sandler:>Sflc for legal help in setting it

1045
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Karen Sandler:>up.

1046
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.100
<v Karen Sandler:>So I've been involved with, uh, and

1047
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Karen Sandler:>other lawyers were more of the primary

1048
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.299
<v Karen Sandler:>contacts on that.

1049
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.500
<v Karen Sandler:>But I've been involved in, um, in

1050
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.420
<v Karen Sandler:>this program since its inception, which is

1051
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.299
<v Karen Sandler:>pretty exciting.

1052
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and it started in 2010.

1053
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.580
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and it started because I was

1054
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.580
<v Karen Sandler:>participating in a program called Google Summer

1055
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Karen Sandler:>of code.

1056
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.420
<v Karen Sandler:>And Google Summer of code is an

1057
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.500
<v Karen Sandler:>internship program that Google runs for open

1058
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.259
<v Karen Sandler:>source projects where, um where students are

1059
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.460
<v Karen Sandler:>allowed to get these, they get these

1060
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Karen Sandler:>paid internships where they work remotely for

1061
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.180
<v Karen Sandler:>a few months.

1062
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.460
<v Karen Sandler:>And at GNOME, they had 181 applicants,

1063
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.859
<v Karen Sandler:>and none of them appeared to be

1064
00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.460
<v Karen Sandler:>women.

1065
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.500
<v Karen Sandler:>And so my good friend Marina was

1066
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.740
<v Karen Sandler:>tapped to, um, to kind of look

1067
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.899
<v Karen Sandler:>and figure out whether there was.

1068
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.580
<v Karen Sandler:>Well, actually, there was another program in

1069
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.540
<v Karen Sandler:>2006 that was started then, but then

1070
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.259
<v Karen Sandler:>nothing happened with it.

1071
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.180
<v Karen Sandler:>And then in 22,009, Marina was tapped

1072
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.620
<v Karen Sandler:>to sort of like she was very

1073
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.580
<v Karen Sandler:>involved with the Gnome Foundation.

1074
00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.020
<v Karen Sandler:>She was a gnome shell developer, and

1075
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.620
<v Karen Sandler:>she was tapped to to create something

1076
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.379
<v Karen Sandler:>to help with this.

1077
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.419
<v Karen Sandler:>And so she came up, she re

1078
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Karen Sandler:>revamped that whole program and launched an

1079
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.900
<v Karen Sandler:>outreach program for women, um, which started

1080
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.900
<v Karen Sandler:>with six interns, um, in 2010, um,

1081
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Karen Sandler:>working um on various aspects of GNOME

1082
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Karen Sandler:>and I came over as executive director

1083
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.780
<v Karen Sandler:>and it was just, you know, whatever

1084
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Karen Sandler:>the professional equivalent of love at first

1085
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.380
<v Karen Sandler:>sight was.

1086
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.259
<v Karen Sandler:>And Marina, um, we jumped into it

1087
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Karen Sandler:>together and we immediately started building the

1088
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.780
<v Karen Sandler:>program together.

1089
00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.620
<v Karen Sandler:>We expanded it to other communities, um,

1090
00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.140
<v Karen Sandler:>and, uh, and, uh, and slowly grew

1091
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.339
<v Karen Sandler:>it.

1092
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, I had been a, um,

1093
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.580
<v Karen Sandler:>a co-founder of the Software Freedom Conservancy

1094
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.100
<v Karen Sandler:>from when I was at the Software

1095
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.140
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Law Center.

1096
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.379
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, I was the one who filed

1097
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.180
<v Karen Sandler:>the incorporation papers and, um, uh, and

1098
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Karen Sandler:>it was an initiative of the Software

1099
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.460
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Law Center to launch Software Freedom

1100
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460
<v Karen Sandler:>Conservancy.

1101
00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I had been a volunteer

1102
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.860
<v Karen Sandler:>throughout the time I was at GNOME

1103
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.540
<v Karen Sandler:>and Software Freedom Conservancy, which is a

1104
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.819
<v Karen Sandler:>fiscal sponsor.

1105
00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.299
<v Karen Sandler:>It's the umbrella organization, and it's the

1106
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.859
<v Karen Sandler:>home of many free and open source

1107
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.940
<v Karen Sandler:>software projects.

1108
00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.420
<v Karen Sandler:>Uh, it also, uh, we do three

1109
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.980
<v Karen Sandler:>different branches, which I guess I'll explain

1110
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.420
<v Karen Sandler:>in a, in a little bit, but,

1111
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.580
<v Karen Sandler:>um, but Software Freedom Conservancy was actually

1112
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.060
<v Karen Sandler:>the first, uh, organization that wound up

1113
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.980
<v Karen Sandler:>participating with its twisted project in outreach

1114
00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Karen Sandler:>program for women early, and we realized

1115
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.779
<v Karen Sandler:>we could expand it.

1116
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.259
<v Karen Sandler:>We expanded to Linux kernel.

1117
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.339
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and soon the program was a

1118
00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.299
<v Karen Sandler:>larger program, um, where we expanded its

1119
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.140
<v Karen Sandler:>criteria.

1120
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.460
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, we ultimately renamed it as Outreachy.

1121
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Karen Sandler:>And, um, now we um, uh, now,

1122
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.819
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, we, we provide internships not just

1123
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Karen Sandler:>to women, uh, and actually not all

1124
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.419
<v Karen Sandler:>women now, because the program is only

1125
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.060
<v Karen Sandler:>open to people who are subject to

1126
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.129
<v Karen Sandler:>systemic bias and are impacted by The

1127
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Karen Sandler:>representation.

1128
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.009
<v Karen Sandler:>So we seek essays from people and

1129
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.850
<v Karen Sandler:>they tell us, like, we don't presume

1130
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.290
<v Karen Sandler:>to understand all of the discrimination and

1131
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.850
<v Karen Sandler:>systemic bias that's out there in the

1132
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Karen Sandler:>world.

1133
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.330
<v Karen Sandler:>So we have our applicants tell us,

1134
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.009
<v Karen Sandler:>and the essay is not graded based

1135
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.689
<v Karen Sandler:>on how beautifully it's written, or even

1136
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.089
<v Karen Sandler:>if the person uses correct grammar and

1137
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:13.730
<v Karen Sandler:>spelling.

1138
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.490
<v Karen Sandler:>For us, it's just we want to

1139
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Karen Sandler:>hear about people's experiences with their own,

1140
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.250
<v Karen Sandler:>um, how they're impacted by systemic bias

1141
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.210
<v Karen Sandler:>and impacted by discrimination.

1142
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.650
<v Karen Sandler:>And now we've run the program all

1143
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.610
<v Karen Sandler:>of this time.

1144
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:29.689
<v Karen Sandler:>And, uh, um, it's it's been an

1145
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.450
<v Karen Sandler:>amazing journey.

1146
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.569
<v Karen Sandler:>And Noam launched outreach program for women,

1147
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.290
<v Karen Sandler:>but as it was rebranded into Outreachy,

1148
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Karen Sandler:>um, and as it, uh, as it

1149
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.330
<v Karen Sandler:>grew, it moved over to Software Freedom

1150
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Karen Sandler:>Conservancy.

1151
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was funny because I had

1152
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Karen Sandler:>already left GNOME as executive director and

1153
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.529
<v Karen Sandler:>came over to Software Freedom Conservancy as

1154
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.970
<v Karen Sandler:>executive director, kind of swapping my volunteer

1155
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.089
<v Karen Sandler:>role for my professional role and vice

1156
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.730
<v Karen Sandler:>versa.

1157
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Karen Sandler:>So I became a volunteer for GNOME,

1158
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.210
<v Karen Sandler:>and I joined its board of directors

1159
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.810
<v Karen Sandler:>as a volunteer, and my executive director

1160
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Karen Sandler:>role was with Software Freedom Conservancy, um,

1161
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Karen Sandler:>which was which was super fun.

1162
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.450
<v Karen Sandler:>And then, uh, and then on the

1163
00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:06.090
<v Karen Sandler:>same path at the same time, Outreachy

1164
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.610
<v Karen Sandler:>moved from GNOME to Software Freedom Conservancy.

1165
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Karen Sandler:>And it was fun because I basically

1166
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Karen Sandler:>said, well, I can't be part of

1167
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.810
<v Karen Sandler:>that decision because I'm completely conflicted.

1168
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Karen Sandler:>I'm on the board of directors of

1169
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.570
<v Karen Sandler:>GNOME, but I'm executive director of Software

1170
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.490
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Conservancy.

1171
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.770
<v Karen Sandler:>And so Marina handled that evaluation herself.

1172
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.130
<v Karen Sandler:>And we I lined up lawyers directly

1173
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.290
<v Karen Sandler:>to advise, to advise Outreachy and to

1174
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.570
<v Karen Sandler:>advise Software Freedom Conservancy.

1175
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.650
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and so we had um, it

1176
00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.850
<v Karen Sandler:>was it was a really interesting little

1177
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:29.970
<v Karen Sandler:>thing.

1178
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Karen Sandler:>And then in 2014, I think it

1179
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Karen Sandler:>was, uh, outreachy moved over to Software

1180
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.290
<v Karen Sandler:>Freedom Conservancy, where it is now.

1181
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.810
<v Karen Sandler:>And so Software Freedom Conservancy is my

1182
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.090
<v Karen Sandler:>absolute dream job.

1183
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.650
<v Karen Sandler:>I call myself the luckiest cyborg lawyer

1184
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:43.370
<v Karen Sandler:>in the world.

1185
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.970
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, because the main three things that

1186
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.450
<v Karen Sandler:>our organization does is we, um, as

1187
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Karen Sandler:>I said, we're a fiscal sponsor, so

1188
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.770
<v Karen Sandler:>we recognize that no one can leave

1189
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.890
<v Karen Sandler:>using proprietary software if there's nothing to

1190
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:56.610
<v Karen Sandler:>switch to.

1191
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.210
<v Karen Sandler:>So we help support the creation of

1192
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.770
<v Karen Sandler:>free and open source software.

1193
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.129
<v Karen Sandler:>Then we have a second what we

1194
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.049
<v Karen Sandler:>our logo is a tree.

1195
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Karen Sandler:>So we talk about our branches.

1196
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.089
<v Karen Sandler:>So our second branch is Outreachy where

1197
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.610
<v Karen Sandler:>we provide these opportunities.

1198
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.129
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, because our software will never be

1199
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Karen Sandler:>made for everyone if it's not made

1200
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Karen Sandler:>by everyone.

1201
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.089
<v Karen Sandler:>And a good example of that is

1202
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:19.890
<v Karen Sandler:>the way my defibrillator shocked me, because

1203
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.129
<v Karen Sandler:>I was not part of the anticipated

1204
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Karen Sandler:>use case.

1205
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Karen Sandler:>Right?

1206
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.890
<v Karen Sandler:>There are all these great little videos

1207
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.170
<v Karen Sandler:>that were flying around Twitter.

1208
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Karen Sandler:>Once upon a time where they were

1209
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.370
<v Karen Sandler:>like soap dispensers and, um, you see

1210
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.330
<v Karen Sandler:>a person with a light colored hand,

1211
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.210
<v Karen Sandler:>a light skinned hand put their hand

1212
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.290
<v Karen Sandler:>under the soap dispenser and soap comes

1213
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.770
<v Karen Sandler:>out as you would expect it to.

1214
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Karen Sandler:>And then someone with dark skin puts

1215
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.890
<v Karen Sandler:>their hand under the very same soap

1216
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.930
<v Karen Sandler:>dispenser, and nothing happens until they put

1217
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.930
<v Karen Sandler:>a white paper towel on top of

1218
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.530
<v Karen Sandler:>their hand and the soap comes out.

1219
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Karen Sandler:>And it really, it's just very clear

1220
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.770
<v Karen Sandler:>that there was no one on the

1221
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.009
<v Karen Sandler:>team that made and tested that soap

1222
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.450
<v Karen Sandler:>dispenser who had dark skin.

1223
00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:00.129
<v Karen Sandler:>So until you make your technology diversely,

1224
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Karen Sandler:>you probably won't make.

1225
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.089
<v Karen Sandler:>You won't be able to anticipate all

1226
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.370
<v Karen Sandler:>of the use cases that are happening,

1227
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.210
<v Karen Sandler:>even still.

1228
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.290
<v Karen Sandler:>Technology needs to be changeable.

1229
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:11.129
<v Karen Sandler:>It needs to evolve over time, but

1230
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.450
<v Karen Sandler:>you won't stand a chance if you're

1231
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.689
<v Karen Sandler:>just making it with a small group

1232
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.049
<v Karen Sandler:>of people.

1233
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Karen Sandler:>So that's our second branch.

1234
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Karen Sandler:>And then our third branch is standing

1235
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.650
<v Karen Sandler:>up for, um, for copyleft, which as

1236
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.330
<v Karen Sandler:>I explained earlier, it's sort of the,

1237
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Karen Sandler:>um, this fun licensing regime where instead

1238
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.890
<v Karen Sandler:>of using copyright to keep software a

1239
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Karen Sandler:>monopolized small, you know, monopolized way to

1240
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.810
<v Karen Sandler:>extract royalties from people.

1241
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.930
<v Karen Sandler:>Instead, you use that copyright, but to

1242
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.089
<v Karen Sandler:>require sharing.

1243
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.009
<v Karen Sandler:>And so it's, uh, detractors used to

1244
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.250
<v Karen Sandler:>call it viral, but, uh, but it's,

1245
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.890
<v Karen Sandler:>uh, uh, you know, a forever free

1246
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.009
<v Karen Sandler:>model, and, um, and it it it

1247
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.049
<v Karen Sandler:>what's neat about copyleft is it is

1248
00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Karen Sandler:>actually a software right to repair.

1249
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.319
<v Karen Sandler:>So it basically gives millions of people

1250
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.800
<v Karen Sandler:>rights to fix their devices.

1251
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.279
<v Karen Sandler:>It gives you the right to ask

1252
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.160
<v Karen Sandler:>for, um, for the source code.

1253
00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.839
<v Karen Sandler:>And especially if you look at one

1254
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.360
<v Karen Sandler:>of the most popular copyleft licenses, GPL,

1255
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Karen Sandler:>the GPL v2.

1256
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Karen Sandler:>In that license, it says that they

1257
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.920
<v Karen Sandler:>must provide not just the complete and

1258
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Karen Sandler:>corresponding source code, but including complete and

1259
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Karen Sandler:>corresponding source code, including the scripts to

1260
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.320
<v Karen Sandler:>control compilation and installation.

1261
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.600
<v Karen Sandler:>So you must be able to replace

1262
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.200
<v Karen Sandler:>your software.

1263
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.760
<v Karen Sandler:>You must be able to repair it.

1264
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Karen Sandler:>And that's really that's our third.

1265
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:22.840
<v Karen Sandler:>Our third chapter.

1266
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.839
<v Karen Sandler:>We do things like, um, we filed

1267
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.600
<v Karen Sandler:>a lawsuit against the television manufacturer Vizio,

1268
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.640
<v Karen Sandler:>which is a very large TV manufacturer

1269
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.720
<v Karen Sandler:>in the United States.

1270
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.479
<v Karen Sandler:>Because they were not following the rules,

1271
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Karen Sandler:>they weren't making their complete and corresponding

1272
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.520
<v Karen Sandler:>source code available.

1273
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Karen Sandler:>And so, um, when they didn't respond

1274
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.839
<v Karen Sandler:>to us asking them very nicely, we

1275
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.440
<v Karen Sandler:>filed a lawsuit as a consumer, as

1276
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.799
<v Karen Sandler:>a purchaser of devices, because they are

1277
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.560
<v Karen Sandler:>the ones who know that the device

1278
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.399
<v Karen Sandler:>is not in compliance and also have

1279
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.319
<v Karen Sandler:>an acute need for it.

1280
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.000
<v Karen Sandler:>These TVs surveil us.

1281
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.560
<v Karen Sandler:>They collect a lot of information about

1282
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.200
<v Karen Sandler:>us, and they also could be useful

1283
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.319
<v Karen Sandler:>to do other things than what the

1284
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Karen Sandler:>device manufacturers think we should be using

1285
00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Karen Sandler:>them for.

1286
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Karen Sandler:>And because of these licenses, we have

1287
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.240
<v Karen Sandler:>a right to that software.

1288
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.880
<v Karen Sandler:>So we're trying to connect the dots

1289
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.200
<v Karen Sandler:>on on copyleft and how critical that

1290
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.919
<v Karen Sandler:>is to the things that that folks

1291
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Karen Sandler:>do.

1292
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I'm really feel super lucky

1293
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Karen Sandler:>to work at Software Freedom Conservancy.

1294
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.399
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Thank you.

1295
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Um, you also got several, uh, awards.

1296
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.960
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Um, in 2011, the O'Reilly Open Source

1297
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Award, in 2017, the Free Software Award

1298
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Elisabetta Mori:>for your work promoting software freedom, and

1299
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.160
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in 2023 the honorary doctor in Belgium

1300
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.799
<v Elisabetta Mori:>at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

1301
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And you were, uh, you You mentioned

1302
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Elisabetta Mori:>it earlier, but, um, can you tell,

1303
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.880
<v Elisabetta Mori:>uh, can you tell us, uh, first,

1304
00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Elisabetta Mori:>did you expect it?

1305
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.120
<v Karen Sandler:>No.

1306
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.560
<v Karen Sandler:>It was a huge surprise.

1307
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.440
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and it's probably the most meaningful,

1308
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.839
<v Karen Sandler:>like those other awards.

1309
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Karen Sandler:>Very nice.

1310
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, you know, as an adult, you

1311
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.040
<v Karen Sandler:>don't really have the opportunity for people

1312
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Karen Sandler:>to say good job to, like, get

1313
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.200
<v Karen Sandler:>recognition for what you do.

1314
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.200
<v Karen Sandler:>So they were very meaningful to me.

1315
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.439
<v Karen Sandler:>But, um, but for the, um, for

1316
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.560
<v Karen Sandler:>the Kai Levin honorary doctorate, it was

1317
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Karen Sandler:>a total surprise.

1318
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.279
<v Karen Sandler:>And the best thing about it is

1319
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.920
<v Karen Sandler:>that it was the students who decided

1320
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.920
<v Karen Sandler:>I should get it.

1321
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Karen Sandler:>So they do five per year, four

1322
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.839
<v Karen Sandler:>are nominated by faculty, and they're usually,

1323
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Karen Sandler:>um, folks that are working on things

1324
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.120
<v Karen Sandler:>that the academics at Kai Levin are

1325
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Karen Sandler:>building on from their work, for example.

1326
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, and then the fifth one is

1327
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.069
<v Karen Sandler:>the students nominated, and it's a 60

1328
00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.030
<v Karen Sandler:>000 student university.

1329
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.910
<v Karen Sandler:>So presumably some of the students want

1330
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:52.870
<v Karen Sandler:>to give it to, you know, like

1331
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Karen Sandler:>Taylor Swift.

1332
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.110
<v Karen Sandler:>So like or somebody like that.

1333
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.190
<v Karen Sandler:>So what was really neat about it

1334
00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.189
<v Karen Sandler:>was that, um, it reflected the fact

1335
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.870
<v Karen Sandler:>that there were students at the school

1336
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.509
<v Karen Sandler:>who understood the value of free and

1337
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Karen Sandler:>open source software and understood how important

1338
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.550
<v Karen Sandler:>the concept of software freedom is, then

1339
00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.270
<v Karen Sandler:>that they had encountered my work and

1340
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.510
<v Karen Sandler:>that they found it interesting and inspiring

1341
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.470
<v Karen Sandler:>and that they wanted to collaborate with

1342
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.310
<v Karen Sandler:>the movement was really, really huge.

1343
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.350
<v Karen Sandler:>And then the fact that the students

1344
00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.070
<v Karen Sandler:>that didn't know about it, which presumably

1345
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.230
<v Karen Sandler:>was most of them, that they could

1346
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.870
<v Karen Sandler:>understand why the work was important and

1347
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.069
<v Karen Sandler:>that it was important and that they

1348
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Karen Sandler:>cared about it, I think was the

1349
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Karen Sandler:>most incredible thing.

1350
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.390
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, I've done a lot of, you

1351
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:36.430
<v Karen Sandler:>know, interviews over the years.

1352
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.990
<v Karen Sandler:>There have been, um, articles and documentaries

1353
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.950
<v Karen Sandler:>in most of those works.

1354
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.549
<v Karen Sandler:>There's something wrong.

1355
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.670
<v Karen Sandler:>There's some fact that's wrong.

1356
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.110
<v Karen Sandler:>Some like some thing that they didn't

1357
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.910
<v Karen Sandler:>quite get right about what the work

1358
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.430
<v Karen Sandler:>stood for, or even just some basic

1359
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.069
<v Karen Sandler:>fact.

1360
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Karen Sandler:>But in the movie that they made

1361
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Karen Sandler:>and in the the explanations that they

1362
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.310
<v Karen Sandler:>gave about why they wanted to give

1363
00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Karen Sandler:>me the award, they got everything 100%

1364
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Karen Sandler:>right.

1365
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.470
<v Karen Sandler:>And I was so struck by that

1366
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.110
<v Karen Sandler:>because they really took the time.

1367
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Karen Sandler:>And what it stands for, for me,

1368
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.270
<v Karen Sandler:>is the fact that something has fundamentally

1369
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.509
<v Karen Sandler:>changed, that young people care about the

1370
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.310
<v Karen Sandler:>state of their software, they care about

1371
00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:13.390
<v Karen Sandler:>who's making it.

1372
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.189
<v Karen Sandler:>They care about what it will mean

1373
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.750
<v Karen Sandler:>for their lives down the road.

1374
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.069
<v Karen Sandler:>And it, you know, and and also

1375
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.670
<v Karen Sandler:>what they think is valuable that they

1376
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.430
<v Karen Sandler:>want to spend their time.

1377
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Karen Sandler:>And when I give a lecture around

1378
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.710
<v Karen Sandler:>the, um, the doctorate, um, there was

1379
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.149
<v Karen Sandler:>great participation from folks in the law

1380
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.070
<v Karen Sandler:>school, in the engineering school, in computer

1381
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:33.830
<v Karen Sandler:>science.

1382
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:35.710
<v Karen Sandler:>So it was just it was it

1383
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.549
<v Karen Sandler:>was really, I'd say, one of the

1384
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:40.149
<v Karen Sandler:>most meaningful things because it made me

1385
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.670
<v Karen Sandler:>feel like I'm not just on a

1386
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.430
<v Karen Sandler:>hamster wheel.

1387
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.069
<v Karen Sandler:>Like I'm not just shouting into a

1388
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:46.670
<v Karen Sandler:>void.

1389
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.629
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, trying to get things to change.

1390
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Karen Sandler:>That will never change.

1391
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.310
<v Karen Sandler:>But in fact stands for the fact

1392
00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Karen Sandler:>that they will change because smart young

1393
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Karen Sandler:>people care about it.

1394
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.069
<v Karen Sandler:>Smart older people also care about it.

1395
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.229
<v Karen Sandler:>And they're retiring like we're about to

1396
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.390
<v Karen Sandler:>like we're about to have this explosion

1397
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.430
<v Karen Sandler:>of productivity.

1398
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.830
<v Karen Sandler:>And it's I just can't I just

1399
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:06.270
<v Karen Sandler:>can't wait.

1400
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Karen Sandler:>It's such an exciting time in software

1401
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.310
<v Karen Sandler:>freedom and in technology in general, because

1402
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Karen Sandler:>while we've created this massive dystopia, we're

1403
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.390
<v Karen Sandler:>finally in the change the part where

1404
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.350
<v Karen Sandler:>things can change.

1405
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.109
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Um, so if you look about at

1406
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:25.470
<v Elisabetta Mori:>the future, um, what are the things

1407
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.950
<v Elisabetta Mori:>that you can see that are going

1408
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.029
<v Elisabetta Mori:>in the right direction?

1409
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Elisabetta Mori:>And what are the things that we

1410
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.990
<v Elisabetta Mori:>really need to be careful about?

1411
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:37.470
<v Karen Sandler:>Yeah, I mean, I'd say like.

1412
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.750
<v Karen Sandler:>It's funny because one of the things

1413
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:41.990
<v Karen Sandler:>I'm most proud of, of my career

1414
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.509
<v Karen Sandler:>is the fact that we had more

1415
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.109
<v Karen Sandler:>than a thousand students come through the

1416
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.110
<v Karen Sandler:>outreach program.

1417
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, like all these opportunities for folks

1418
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Karen Sandler:>that are subject to systemic bias who

1419
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.030
<v Karen Sandler:>wouldn't ordinarily be included.

1420
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.230
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think that the like software

1421
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.390
<v Karen Sandler:>freedom stands for the proposition that we

1422
00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:00.470
<v Karen Sandler:>can democratize our technology, but in effect,

1423
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Karen Sandler:>we haven't really done that very much.

1424
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, you know, most of our technology

1425
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Karen Sandler:>creation is very homogeneous, and it's done

1426
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.830
<v Karen Sandler:>by a very centralized small group of

1427
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:12.549
<v Karen Sandler:>companies.

1428
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Karen Sandler:>So looking forward, what what I want

1429
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.310
<v Karen Sandler:>to what I, what I'm hoping to

1430
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Karen Sandler:>see is this explosion of contributions from

1431
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.750
<v Karen Sandler:>folks who have had enough, you know,

1432
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Karen Sandler:>who are willing to like it's really

1433
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.950
<v Karen Sandler:>hard to change what you do.

1434
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.910
<v Karen Sandler:>It's really hard if you're used to

1435
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.109
<v Karen Sandler:>certain, you know, if you're used to

1436
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:37.950
<v Karen Sandler:>having certain apps or features on your

1437
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.500
<v Karen Sandler:>phone or on your computer.

1438
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Karen Sandler:>It's really hard to go back, but

1439
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.900
<v Karen Sandler:>people are willing to, you know, um,

1440
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.580
<v Karen Sandler:>one of my kids is now 11

1441
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.819
<v Karen Sandler:>and like quite a few kids now

1442
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.459
<v Karen Sandler:>have flip phones and are happy for

1443
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:51.620
<v Karen Sandler:>it.

1444
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.740
<v Karen Sandler:>They've read the articles saying that social

1445
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Karen Sandler:>media causes, uh, depression in teenagers.

1446
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Karen Sandler:>They've read the fact that screens and

1447
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.660
<v Karen Sandler:>the use of smartphones interfere with their

1448
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.620
<v Karen Sandler:>brain development.

1449
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.540
<v Karen Sandler:>And they don't they don't.

1450
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.259
<v Karen Sandler:>They don't want it.

1451
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.859
<v Karen Sandler:>That's what foreign grown ups do.

1452
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.980
<v Karen Sandler:>And they don't want it anymore.

1453
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:10.300
<v Karen Sandler:>Right.

1454
00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.660
<v Karen Sandler:>So looking forward, I think that, um,

1455
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.460
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, the sharing of information where

1456
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.740
<v Karen Sandler:>we're able to critically look at where

1457
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.819
<v Karen Sandler:>we're we are a data like a

1458
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.940
<v Karen Sandler:>data driven society where we look for,

1459
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.380
<v Karen Sandler:>you know, uh, concrete aggregation of information

1460
00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.660
<v Karen Sandler:>about the impact of technology and where,

1461
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.980
<v Karen Sandler:>um, we're seeing what doesn't work.

1462
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Karen Sandler:>We are seeing an increase in a

1463
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.779
<v Karen Sandler:>willingness to regulate.

1464
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.580
<v Karen Sandler:>I was astounded that GDPR was able

1465
00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Karen Sandler:>to happen in Europe.

1466
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.100
<v Karen Sandler:>And so happy and grateful.

1467
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think we're going to be

1468
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.779
<v Karen Sandler:>able to I think we're going to

1469
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Karen Sandler:>see more regulation.

1470
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.460
<v Karen Sandler:>But the downside is that there's a

1471
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.580
<v Karen Sandler:>contraction of funding across the board.

1472
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.100
<v Karen Sandler:>There's less money coming into software freedom.

1473
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.859
<v Karen Sandler:>And there was a co-option of the

1474
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.460
<v Karen Sandler:>software freedom movement by companies that were

1475
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.300
<v Karen Sandler:>wanting to extract the value of open

1476
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:57.860
<v Karen Sandler:>source.

1477
00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.940
<v Karen Sandler:>And so we're going to have to

1478
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Karen Sandler:>get over this, and we're going to

1479
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.500
<v Karen Sandler:>get over this through a really catastrophic

1480
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Karen Sandler:>I mean, it really looks like we're

1481
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.299
<v Karen Sandler:>in this catastrophic time where funding is

1482
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.060
<v Karen Sandler:>contracting.

1483
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.100
<v Karen Sandler:>Companies did massive layoffs.

1484
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.740
<v Karen Sandler:>They're very focused on their profit centers.

1485
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Karen Sandler:>And so I think things are going

1486
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.020
<v Karen Sandler:>to get worse before they get better.

1487
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.900
<v Karen Sandler:>But I think through all that pain,

1488
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.180
<v Karen Sandler:>I think we'll emerge on the other

1489
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Karen Sandler:>side with a willingness to have more,

1490
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.899
<v Karen Sandler:>um, you know, the societal collaborations that

1491
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.140
<v Karen Sandler:>we need for our software.

1492
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.100
<v Karen Sandler:>And I think this, you know, well,

1493
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.420
<v Karen Sandler:>it'll be very interesting to see what

1494
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Karen Sandler:>happens with generative AI.

1495
00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.819
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, you know, and when when that

1496
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Karen Sandler:>bubble likely bursts, that'll be a really

1497
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Karen Sandler:>interesting, um, you know, situation to see.

1498
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.819
<v Karen Sandler:>So, you know, there's it'll it'll be

1499
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.779
<v Karen Sandler:>it'll be fascinating.

1500
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.779
<v Karen Sandler:>And I hope that, um, you know,

1501
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.859
<v Karen Sandler:>I'm sort of in the middle of

1502
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.299
<v Karen Sandler:>my career and I'm hoping that I

1503
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.859
<v Karen Sandler:>can be a part of I can

1504
00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.180
<v Karen Sandler:>I can hold out long enough to

1505
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.740
<v Karen Sandler:>be a part of the real, of

1506
00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Karen Sandler:>the real change where things actually get

1507
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.180
<v Karen Sandler:>a lot better.

1508
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.980
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Uh, is there anything you would like

1509
00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.940
<v Elisabetta Mori:>to add that we haven't covered today?

1510
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.140
<v Karen Sandler:>I would say that if you are

1511
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Karen Sandler:>able, you should donate to these causes

1512
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.340
<v Karen Sandler:>that you care about.

1513
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.620
<v Karen Sandler:>Where software freedom Conservancy.

1514
00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.259
<v Karen Sandler:>So SF Conservancy org.

1515
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.740
<v Karen Sandler:>Please, please, please sign up as a

1516
00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.220
<v Karen Sandler:>sustainer.

1517
00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Karen Sandler:>But the situation is getting dire across

1518
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Karen Sandler:>all of the nonprofits in our space.

1519
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Karen Sandler:>Our technology has never been more fragile,

1520
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.859
<v Karen Sandler:>and we need both the advocacy and

1521
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Karen Sandler:>the technology creation.

1522
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.060
<v Karen Sandler:>So if you feel you could do

1523
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Karen Sandler:>that, you should also speaking up.

1524
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.460
<v Karen Sandler:>Um, it's becoming much harder to stand

1525
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Karen Sandler:>up to discrimination and systemic bias.

1526
00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.060
<v Karen Sandler:>Lots of companies, for example, have cut

1527
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Karen Sandler:>their, um, their funding for because they

1528
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.379
<v Karen Sandler:>don't want to support anybody's woke agenda,

1529
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.460
<v Karen Sandler:>which I completely understand.

1530
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.939
<v Karen Sandler:>But it does mean that these opportunities

1531
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Karen Sandler:>there are fewer and far between for

1532
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.379
<v Karen Sandler:>people to get involved.

1533
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.819
<v Karen Sandler:>So getting engaged, you know, I think

1534
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Karen Sandler:>is is really important.

1535
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Karen Sandler:>And I know this is meant to

1536
00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.700
<v Karen Sandler:>be archival.

1537
00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.980
<v Karen Sandler:>So it's like living I'm talking in

1538
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.259
<v Karen Sandler:>this moment of time.

1539
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.779
<v Karen Sandler:>And I'm hoping that in the long

1540
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Karen Sandler:>run, you people of the future will

1541
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Karen Sandler:>say, ha ha, what an interesting time

1542
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.340
<v Karen Sandler:>it was in the 2020s, and now

1543
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.460
<v Karen Sandler:>we've solved so many of these problems,

1544
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.100
<v Karen Sandler:>and I, I hope we have, uh,

1545
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.180
<v Karen Sandler:>but I guess the, the main thing

1546
00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.300
<v Karen Sandler:>about, about our particular time is that

1547
00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.660
<v Karen Sandler:>we all need to get it's so

1548
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.060
<v Karen Sandler:>dire that every single individual needs to

1549
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.420
<v Karen Sandler:>get involved, and it needs to happen

1550
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:25.740
<v Karen Sandler:>now.

1551
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.140
<v Elisabetta Mori:>So we are almost done.

1552
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.810
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Uh, but I hope we have other

1553
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.450
<v Elisabetta Mori:>chances to chat again.

1554
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.170
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Maybe on Thursday.

1555
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:40.170
<v Elisabetta Mori:>Uh, one last question.

<v Elisabetta Mori:>Are you still available?

1560
00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:51.330
<v Karen Sandler:>Oh, boy.

1561
00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Karen Sandler:>I you know, I was actually just

1562
00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Karen Sandler:>asked to DJ this past, uh, I

1563
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.250
<v Karen Sandler:>was asked to DJ for an event

1564
00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:57.850
<v Karen Sandler:>in August.

1565
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:02.970
<v Karen Sandler:>I maybe, maybe I it's very fun.

1566
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.490
<v Karen Sandler:>So I, I haven't done it in

1567
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:06.569
<v Karen Sandler:>a little while, so I'm kind of

1568
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:07.170
