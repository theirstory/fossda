00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.861
<v Heather Meeker:>Hello, Tristan, and welcome to FOSSDA!

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Heather Meeker:>I'd like to start by just asking

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Heather Meeker:>you to introduce yourself and tell us

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.399
<v Heather Meeker:>a little bit about yourself.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.668
<v Tristan Nitot:>Okay so, my name is Tristan Nitot.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>I pronounce it the French way because

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>I'm a French citizen.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>I am 55.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was born in Paris' suburbs and

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>I live in Paris.

11
00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I have been involved with computers

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>since I was 14.

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.792
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think that was in 1980 or

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.869
<v Tristan Nitot:>is it...'81?

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I can't remember exactly.

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>But for some reason, a friend of

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.454
<v Tristan Nitot:>my parents' bought a TRS-80, a Tandy

18
00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>RadioShack, that, you know, made it to

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>France somehow back then and thought 'oh,

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>the young Tristan may be interested in

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.361
<v Tristan Nitot:>this new thing'.

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, he was going on vacation

23
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>for two weeks and so, before going

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>to vacation, he dropped it at the

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>house - which was at the time

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.369
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Normandy, in rural, very rural Normandy,

27
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the middle of nowhere - and

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>for 15 days in a row, I

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.926
<v Tristan Nitot:>was stuck in front of it.

30
00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, opening the manual page 1

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>and starting to read and it was

32
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>very exciting.

33
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>I can't remember whether it was in

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>French or in English, but I started

35
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>learning how to program computers with the

36
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>BASIC language there, and it was like

37
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>a tiny door open to a new

38
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>world that grown ups did not understand

39
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>at all.

40
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, that made me very special and

41
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>so, it made the world very exciting,

42
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, learning new things where no

43
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>one around me could compete with, you

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.738
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, because being a kid known in

45
00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:21.683
<v Tristan Nitot:>the place - my parents are wonderful

46
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>- but it was nice to be

47
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>the one that knows the most about

48
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.423
<v Tristan Nitot:>something.

49
00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:30.469
<v Tristan Nitot:>And that's how I got into computing

50
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>and programming at the time.

51
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then my parents, a bit later,

52
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>moved to Paris, where I got the

53
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>opportunity that- there was something here, in

54
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>Paris, that got started, we call it

55
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>the CMI.

56
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.829
<v Tristan Nitot:>In French, CMIE , Centre Mondial Informatique

57
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.523
<v Tristan Nitot:>which means, like, Worldwide Center for Computing,

58
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>which sounds a bit over the top,

59
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>if you ask me, but still.

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was a very special place

61
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>which welcomed computer scientists and also biology

62
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.861
<v Tristan Nitot:>researchers from the MIT mostly.

63
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And in France, where they had, like,

64
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>a gorgeous building right in the middle

65
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>of Paris, the Elysee Palace, which is

66
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>our French House, French White House.

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>You could actually see the French White

68
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>House from from the building itself.

69
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>And the ground floor was open to

70
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>the general public.

71
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I was one of these kids

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>who could use computers, you know, to

73
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.315
<v Tristan Nitot:>show up early in the morning, make

74
00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>sure that you would be the first

75
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>to be sitting in front of the

76
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.268
<v Tristan Nitot:>computer.

77
00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And a whole community started there, you

78
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, people from all walks of life

79
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>happened to be there and started chatting

80
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>and discussing computer stuff and learning stuff

81
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>and teaching each other stuff because there

82
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>was that bunch of computers left in

83
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>front of them.

84
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>We were supposed to learn how to

85
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>program in Logo, that's a programming language.

86
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think the creator of it was

87
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Seymour Papert from MIT, if I recall

88
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.807
<v Tristan Nitot:>correctly.

89
00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>But, you know, in some cases, we

90
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>were illegally copying some games on diskettes

91
00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>and stuff like that.

92
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was not- we were not

93
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>exactly doing what we were supposed to

94
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.207
<v Tristan Nitot:>do, not all of us at least.

95
00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>When I started learning how to program

96
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>computers in Assembly Language, this is where

97
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I first met my well, the Apple

98
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.069
<v Tristan Nitot:>2 computer, which was very exciting.

99
00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>And somehow there were a couple of

100
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>terminals left in the room that nobody

101
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>was using because they were meant for,

102
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.775
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, the organizers of the place,

103
00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>yet to log in and of course,

104
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.969
<v Tristan Nitot:>I didn't have a password.

105
00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>But somehow, a few friends of mine

106
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>managed to hack into the computers and

107
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>into these terminals and got noticed, well,

108
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.253
<v Tristan Nitot:>caught, I don't know.

109
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.645
<v Tristan Nitot:>But they were nice enough to say

110
00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>oh, you seem to be, you know,

111
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>doing pretty well with these things so

112
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>why don't we open up an account

113
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>for you.

114
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, a bunch of us were

115
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>authorized to use the the mainframe computer

116
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>that they had on top of the,

117
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.692
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, everything that the Apple 2s

118
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>and the other personal computers around there.

119
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was- I think it was in

120
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>'82 or '83 or something.

121
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>1982-1983, like that.

122
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And there was one guy that I

123
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>met there who had a long beard

124
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>and long hair and whose name is

125
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>Richard M.

126
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Stallman.

127
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, I met this guy.

128
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>He was just, you know, an ordinary

129
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>guy.

130
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>More hairy than most, but still.

131
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, we were learning different things,

132
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, we were able to use

133
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>the various computers that are there.

134
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so we were- there were like

135
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>a handful of kids, like me, that

136
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>were allowed to go into the corridors,

137
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>into the upper floors and use not

138
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Tristan Nitot:>just the Apple 2s and the rest

139
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>that wasn't it on the ground floor,

140
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>but something else all they had.

141
00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:44.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was tons of fun, we were

142
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>learning a lot.

143
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.822
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it happens that, in retrospect, this

144
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.992
<v Tristan Nitot:>is where a lot of the IT

145
00:07:56.992 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>or startup generations started in France.

146
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.861
<v Tristan Nitot:>A bunch of these kids, including myself,

147
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>well, became involved in computing for the

148
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>rest of their lives and started companies

149
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>and stuff.

150
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>I don't know if you should be

151
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>asking me questions, or should I keep

152
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>going or?

153
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, I'm happy to.

154
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.046
<v Heather Meeker:>So, you met Mr.

155
00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:36.400
<v Heather Meeker:>Stallman and at that time, were you

156
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Heather Meeker:>thinking about free software or open source,

157
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.400
<v Heather Meeker:>or was this before that time?

158
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Heather Meeker:>When did those ideas sort of start

159
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Heather Meeker:>percolating into your world?

160
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was- at first, I was a

161
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>kid so a lot of things were

162
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>not clear in my head like what's

163
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.515
<v Tristan Nitot:>allowed and what's not allowed.

164
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.468
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, like if you copy software,

165
00:09:05.469 --> 00:09:09.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>can you legally do it or you

166
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>just, can you physically do it?

167
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, it's just, it's kind of

168
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>the same thing more or less.

169
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.349
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, whether I was allowed to do

170
00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:25.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>so or not was not very clear

171
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>and therefore, the free software and nature

172
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>of things, well, we were sharing whether

173
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was legal or illegal, by the

174
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>way so, you see what I mean.

175
00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:42.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>And at the time, I didn't realize

176
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>the importance of it, to be honest,

177
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.776
<v Tristan Nitot:>I'm a bit ashamed in retrospect.

178
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>But no, it didn't make any difference

179
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.446
<v Tristan Nitot:>for me.

180
00:09:58.446 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Fast forward to - when was that?

181
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.993
<v Tristan Nitot:>- 1996.

182
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>I had discovered the web, I had

183
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>started doing my first web page.

184
00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:30.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>At that time, the big craze was,

185
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.169
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, having your homepage.

186
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like, if, when you go on the

187
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.761
<v Tristan Nitot:>web, of course, you start browsing but

188
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>there's not a lot to see.

189
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>Then the next step is to build

190
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.305
<v Tristan Nitot:>your own home page, so that's what

191
00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:46.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>I did, but I didn't want to

192
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>do like everybody else.

193
00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:50.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it happened that my wife was

194
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>pregnant with our first child.

195
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, I decided to build the

196
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>home page of our baby which wasn't

197
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>born at the time.

198
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>So you had to put the, you

199
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.492
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, given name, give your name, put

200
00:11:07.492 --> 00:11:10.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>a picture and have your resume but

201
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>in all of these three cases it

202
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.885
<v Tristan Nitot:>was a bit odd.

203
00:11:14.885 --> 00:11:18.161
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, I had to put a picture

204
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>- is it a sonogram?

205
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>Is that how you call it?

206
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>- you know, like, so there was

207
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>that picture of the kid, of the

208
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.154
<v Tristan Nitot:>baby's sonogram instead of a mug shot.

209
00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And we didn't have a name for

210
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.346
<v Tristan Nitot:>him right away, so we call him

211
00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:44.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>Virtual Bob because - well, people kept

212
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>asking 'what's his name?' And I said,

213
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.746
<v Tristan Nitot:>'we'll call him Bob for now' and

214
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>so it was Virtual Bob.

215
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And the page is still online, by

216
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>the way.

217
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I moved it and it's still on

218
00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>my website.

219
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it's mostly in French, some of

220
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>it is in English.

221
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, it was it was fun.

222
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And of course, the craze at the

223
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.746
<v Tristan Nitot:>time was all about Netscape, the web

224
00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>browser, and also the server-side software.

225
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.593
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I was in a company, a

226
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>small French company - sorry, my cat

227
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>is misbehaving - and so, that's a

228
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>French company that imported software from North

229
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:42.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>America, Canadian and American, and I was

230
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>very excited by the web.

231
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And one day, I was browsing on

232
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>the French Netscape website where I saw

233
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>a job posting for, like, kind of

234
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>an evangelist for Netscape in France.

235
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I said, yeah, I could totally picture

236
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>myself being paid for discussing the web

237
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>around me and so, I applied and

238
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>it took a while because the there

239
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>was a hiring freeze at the time

240
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>so they left me for three months,

241
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>hanging out.

242
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>But in nearby, I made it into

243
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:35.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>Netscape , it was in '97 and

244
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was a lot of work, but

245
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was fun with smart people.

246
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:52.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>In '98, then Netscape decides to open

247
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.984
<v Tristan Nitot:>up the source code for Netscape Communicator.

248
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.607
<v Heather Meeker:>Right.

249
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And they called it open source, at

250
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>the time - I'm sorry, it's taking

251
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>me a lot of time to answer

252
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>your question - but it was open

253
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>source because Eric Raymond named it open

254
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>source, he was the guy who was

255
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>involved with Netscape management, and it was

256
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>more, kind of West Coast, very business-friendly

257
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.907
<v Tristan Nitot:>view of the world.

258
00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, open source, I think, at

259
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>the time, was crafted as a word,

260
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>as an expression, as opposed to free

261
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>software which was more, I don't know

262
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>how you call it left it or

263
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>kissed or well, not super business friendly

264
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.552
<v Tristan Nitot:>or where business wouldn't come first, freedom

265
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>was would come first.

266
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, at the time, it was

267
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.761
<v Tristan Nitot:>open source and I was in France,

268
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was employed by Netscape for southern

269
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.361
<v Tristan Nitot:>Europe.

270
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:13.229
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then there was that announcement that

271
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Netscape would give away the browser.

272
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was a matter of price.

273
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.545
<v Tristan Nitot:>So everybody got it.

274
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:25.915
<v Tristan Nitot:>And for that part of the message,

275
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.192
<v Tristan Nitot:>that was easy that price equals 0.

276
00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:28.546
<v Tristan Nitot:>Fine.

277
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, not every salesman was happy with

278
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.812
<v Tristan Nitot:>that because they had quotas, and all

279
00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:37.669
<v Tristan Nitot:>of this, so they were wondering 'how

280
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>am I going to make money if

281
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>the price tag says zero?' They got

282
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>it, not really happy but got it.

283
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then there was that source code

284
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>opening and collaboration and then, you know,

285
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>nobody got a clear understanding of what

286
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.807
<v Tristan Nitot:>it meant.

287
00:15:57.807 --> 00:16:07.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>A couple of, you know, tech people

288
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.238
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Paris kind of got it but

289
00:16:10.238 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>didn't feel that publishing the code was

290
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.113
<v Tristan Nitot:>good.

291
00:16:19.114 --> 00:16:23.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like, nobody cared, like, would the customer

292
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>be interested in the code?

293
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>Of course not.

294
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I mean, they don't even know what

295
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>it means, so you know, so changing

296
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.808
<v Tristan Nitot:>the code- well.

297
00:16:30.807 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then there was me.

298
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:43.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I remember, Richard Stallman and I

299
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>remembered all of that, that it was

300
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>actually, you know, pretty close.

301
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>If you zoom out, you know, seeing

302
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>from afar, it's very similar.

303
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Now, there are significant differences between open

304
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>source and free software, but seen from

305
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>afar, they're pretty close.

306
00:17:03.307 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I was very excited because it

307
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>was a grand idea.

308
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:16.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was something bigger than myself, it

309
00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>was something that was bigger than just

310
00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:21.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>making money and selling software, it was-

311
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>yeah, it was amazingly exciting for reasons

312
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>that are hard to explain.

313
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was not so interested in, you

314
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, selling software.

315
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>That was fine, I mean, making good

316
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>money was fine, but it was not

317
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>super exciting as opposed to open source

318
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>software that once again, was like a

319
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.215
<v Tristan Nitot:>new door was opening, it was amazing.

320
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I think even for the free

321
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>software community, it was a big change

322
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the sense that before that really,

323
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was computer scientists getting together and

324
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>hacking software in the office and sending

325
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>tapes from one place to the other.

326
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yeah, I'm sorry, I never used tapes

327
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>myself.

328
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, actually I did on it here

329
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>as a, you know, not on that

330
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>scale.

331
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was not sending my piece of

332
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>software on tapes to friends, like the

333
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>MIT people did at some point.

334
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.361
<v Heather Meeker:>Uh-huh.

335
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>But it was their way to do

336
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:39.861
<v Tristan Nitot:>things.

337
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:43.876
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then came a new ingredient, that

338
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>was the web, and that completely changed

339
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:56.076
<v Tristan Nitot:>the cooperation between developers.

340
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>Netscape made - well, created - the

341
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla project and along with it came

342
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.469
<v Tristan Nitot:>Bugzilla.

343
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:10.961
<v Heather Meeker:>Uh-huh.

344
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:16.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Which was a complete game changer, even

345
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>if it was not beautiful and not

346
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>super easy to use, it was amazing.

347
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, so basically it's a- you could

348
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>kind of compare it to GitHub these

349
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>days, more or less.

350
00:19:36.254 --> 00:19:41.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's an issue tracker but first it

351
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.558
<v Tristan Nitot:>was, you know, it was running in

352
00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:44.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>a web browser.

353
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.346
<v Tristan Nitot:>That means that everyone with a PC,

354
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>and a web browser, and an internet

355
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>connection, and some understanding of a code,

356
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.715
<v Tristan Nitot:>could start hacking.

357
00:19:55.715 --> 00:19:57.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>And hacking in the sense of, you

358
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.261
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, developing or trying to or playing

359
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>with a piece of software, could contribute

360
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>to that piece of software.

361
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.215
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, it was a complete game changer,

362
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the sense that you didn't have

363
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>to be in the address book of

364
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>a bunch of computer scientists to send

365
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.961
<v Tristan Nitot:>tapes through mail to other people.

366
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>You could show up, you know, you

367
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>could open a bug.

368
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>He just had to open an account

369
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Bugzilla and you could comment on

370
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>bug reports and say 'this is doing

371
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>this and I expect that and I

372
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>suspect this is coming from that piece

373
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>of code' and you started engaging with

374
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>the community.

375
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, the community itself instead of being

376
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>a small one, became potentially, a really

377
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>big one, provided that the project was

378
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.030
<v Tristan Nitot:>interesting.

379
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>And to be honest, the Mozilla project

380
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>was not super interesting at the beginning

381
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.715
<v Tristan Nitot:>for many reasons.

382
00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:11.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>First, well, the piece of software was-

383
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>there was a lot of friction, you

384
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, with Bugzilla and all of that;

385
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.630
<v Tristan Nitot:>the tools were rudimentary.

386
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:24.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And also, there was something, which is

387
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>really bad, is that the source code

388
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>that was open was missing very significant

389
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>pieces because in a bunch of places

390
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Tristan Nitot:>of the communicator code, there were proprietary

391
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.752
<v Tristan Nitot:>list licenses.

392
00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:45.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, Netscape couldn't ship the whole thing

393
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>and you could compile it and make

394
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>it work.

395
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Now, they were willing to ship the

396
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>product but they had to remove big

397
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.146
<v Tristan Nitot:>pieces of it.

398
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, you end up with a

399
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Swiss cheese instead of the whole thing.

400
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, you can compile it, you

401
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>can use it.

402
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.276
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, it was very frustrating, and

403
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>also it was huge, and the quality

404
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:19.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>wasn't great because over the previous years,

405
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Netscape teams had struggled to compete

406
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>with Microsoft and so they rushed features

407
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>half-baked into the product in order to

408
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>beat the competition and all that.

409
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.738
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, this leaves them with a

410
00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>technical debt that was huge.

411
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>So you ended up with a terrible

412
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.376
<v Tristan Nitot:>open source experience.

413
00:22:46.376 --> 00:22:53.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And on top of that, Netscape was

414
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.061
<v Tristan Nitot:>being bought by AOL, America Online.

415
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And maybe in order to help with

416
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Mozilla project, you had to have

417
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>the knowledge to do that.

418
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>The willingness to cope with the terrible

419
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>experience, and you were willing to give

420
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>your precious free time - and as

421
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.699
<v Tristan Nitot:>a computer engineer, you don't have a

422
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>lot of this because you're worth a

423
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.268
<v Tristan Nitot:>lot on the market - and on

424
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:40.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>top of that you were willing to

425
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>give this to - what was his

426
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.454
<v Tristan Nitot:>name?

427
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.554
<v Tristan Nitot:>Is it Steve Case?

428
00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:48.453
<v Heather Meeker:>Uh huh, right.

429
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.192
<v Tristan Nitot:>The CEO of AOL-

430
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.654
<v Heather Meeker:>AOL, yeah.

431
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>The former executive of Pizza Hut, you

432
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.554
<v Tristan Nitot:>know.

433
00:23:56.554 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I'm not saying bad things about

434
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>him but basically, he's not the kind

435
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>of guy that is really appealing to

436
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.476
<v Tristan Nitot:>us or, you know, of two volunteers,

437
00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:10.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>basically.

438
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>Are you willing to give your your

439
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>time with worth some money and your

440
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>energy to someone who's already super rich

441
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>by, you know, selling pizza, And so,

442
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>it wasn't a great start.

443
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>It wasn't a great start for the

444
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla project and it became worse.

445
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was, at the time, I managed

446
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:49.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>to change jobs within Netscape and go

447
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>to, at the time it was Netscape

448
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>Client Predict Division or Client Product Development.

449
00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was Netscape CPD, but I can't

450
00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>remember.

451
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.554
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, you get the gist.

452
00:25:01.554 --> 00:25:05.192
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, they asked me to do

453
00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:11.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>a job, which was, you know, very

454
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>unpleasant, which was - it was an

455
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>important job.

456
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, important, I don't know, but I

457
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>took it seriously, except it wouldn't work.

458
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:32.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was asking web developers to make

459
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.969
<v Tristan Nitot:>sure that their website was compatible with

460
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>the upcoming version, the open source version

461
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.284
<v Tristan Nitot:>following Communicator.

462
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.614
<v Tristan Nitot:>First Netscape Communicator, was bleeding market share.

463
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was terrible with going lower and

464
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>lower.

465
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.076
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was not the hype, it

466
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.123
<v Tristan Nitot:>was not the promising browser and therefore,

467
00:26:06.123 --> 00:26:10.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>people cared less and less about it.

468
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And on top of that, I was

469
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>not talking about the current version, I

470
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>was talking about the newer version, the

471
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>future version, that did not exist at

472
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>the time except in beta 15 versions

473
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>that nobody used.

474
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And they had nothing to do in

475
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>terms of compatibility with the old version.

476
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, telling people that they should change

477
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>their habits, and their products and their

478
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>websites to be compatible with something that

479
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>wasn't there, you know, just in order

480
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>to be future proof and while nobody

481
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>really cared about the product and nobody

482
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>really believed, and that it had a

483
00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>future was extremely unpleasant because people wouldn't

484
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>listen to me.

485
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So we took the long list of

486
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>important websites in the US.

487
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>So I had colleagues that did that

488
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>in US, and I was doing that

489
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Germany, France and UK, like the

490
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>500, the top 500 websites, in these

491
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.823
<v Tristan Nitot:>three countries.

492
00:27:23.823 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>And we were trying all of them,

493
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:35.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>the main features, in the upcoming version

494
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.915
<v Tristan Nitot:>of the browser.

495
00:27:39.915 --> 00:27:43.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>And of course, we were writing down

496
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>what it failed, we opened bug reports

497
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Bugzilla to follow up on that

498
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>and then we were to analyze their

499
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>website syntax and if their HTML and

500
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>JavaScript and CSS was broken, how it

501
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>was broken, how we could fix it.

502
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then we came up with a

503
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>fix and we sent them, and they

504
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>wouldn't care.

505
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.091
<v Heather Meeker:>Uh huh.

506
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, this is why it wasn't pleasant.

507
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>Trying to fix one one website at

508
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>a time, fifteen hundred websites in three

509
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>different languages to people who didn't care

510
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>at all on the other, and that

511
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>wasn't fun.

512
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think it was important because something

513
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>that probably is not clear to people

514
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>who maybe will hear or view this

515
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>video, it's the new version of Communicator

516
00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>which was a open source had a

517
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.628
<v Tristan Nitot:>new engine named Gecko, and Gecko was

518
00:29:02.628 --> 00:29:09.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>a complete rewrite of the old Netscape

519
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>Communicator engine.

520
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And by complete rewrite means that the

521
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>old bugs weren't in the new code

522
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.054
<v Tristan Nitot:>base.

523
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was better, but it was

524
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>less forgiving for spelling mistakes and such

525
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>in-the-web pages, not in the text, but

526
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.523
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the mark-up that made rendering.

527
00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, it meant that if your

528
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>page displayed properly in Internet Explorer, Microsoft

529
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Internet Explorer, or Netscape Communicator cap for

530
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>sorry.

531
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Cathy's, a 44 in French, then you

532
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>thought you would define, but with the

533
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>upcoming version of the Mozilla browser, it

534
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>would fail.

535
00:30:02.254 --> 00:30:07.469
<v Tristan Nitot:>Which was frustrating for everybody involved, both

536
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>the people that made the websites, that

537
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>thought they were good - 'It's rendering

538
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.337
<v Tristan Nitot:>in IE, so I'm fine' - No!

539
00:30:15.337 --> 00:30:21.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And also the Mozilla developers who had

540
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>to replicate Internet Explorer bugs into their

541
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>own code for the safety of compatibility,

542
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>which is, I'm sure very unpleasant.

543
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.600
<v Heather Meeker:>Yeah.

544
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, this was what we were

545
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>doing at a time.

546
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:48.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, this was around 2000 or something.

547
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:56.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>And in the meantime, AOL didn't understand

548
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>a thing about software.

549
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>They had their own proprietary system, which

550
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>was very different from the web than

551
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.415
<v Tristan Nitot:>their online service, which embedded Internet Explorer

552
00:31:13.415 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>- the competition, you know - and

553
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>we were trying to have them include

554
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.061
<v Tristan Nitot:>our piece of software, already ringing engine.

555
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.861
<v Tristan Nitot:>From your own company?

556
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.770
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yes, instead of the competition and they

557
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>didn't get why they would do that

558
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>because it will be less compatible with

559
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>the existing web, than Internet Explorer.

560
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.054
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was frustrating even for them,

561
00:31:42.054 --> 00:31:44.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>and for us as AOL employees.

562
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was a very difficult time and

563
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.023
<v Tristan Nitot:>so, they started laying off Netscape employees.

564
00:31:54.023 --> 00:31:54.890
<v Tristan Nitot:>Several waves.

565
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>I managed to get through a few

566
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>of them, but it was scary like

567
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>maybe you're going to get fired next

568
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>week and you never know.

569
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:19.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, well, it wasn't pleasant for

570
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.869
<v Tristan Nitot:>pretty much everyone involved.

571
00:32:20.869 --> 00:32:25.692
<v Tristan Nitot:>And when they, AOL, got enough of

572
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:35.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>all of this, they were - I

573
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.907
<v Tristan Nitot:>don't know the exact words, I'm sorry,

574
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.193
<v Tristan Nitot:>it's vocabulary I don't use often -

575
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>but they were fighting.

576
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:53.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's more of your realm than mine.

577
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, they were suing.

578
00:32:54.307 --> 00:32:56.523
<v Tristan Nitot:>They were suing Microsoft basically.

579
00:32:56.523 --> 00:33:00.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And they got a deal with Microsoft

580
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.292
<v Tristan Nitot:>like 'we'll stop suing you and you

581
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>write a nice fat check and we're

582
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>good friends now', you know.

583
00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:12.168
<v Tristan Nitot:>Also it's really not good for business,

584
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.576
<v Tristan Nitot:>right?

585
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, Microsoft did write a big

586
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>fat check to AOL which suddenly lost

587
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>- or seem to lost, that's how

588
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I see it - any kind of

589
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.569
<v Tristan Nitot:>interests with Netscape.

590
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.199
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like, 'Okay, got my money.

591
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.961
<v Tristan Nitot:>Why would I care about these hippies

592
00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:35.268
<v Tristan Nitot:>that do open source?'

593
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, they kind of gave up

594
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.146
<v Tristan Nitot:>on us and decided to let the

595
00:33:45.146 --> 00:33:49.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla project go and pretty much everyone

596
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>was laid off.

597
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>A few people, you know, being Computer

598
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Engineers could be, you know, move to

599
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>other AOL divisions and stuff but most

600
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>of the people were laid off which,

601
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was an unpleasant end to an

602
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>unpleasant moment.

603
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was frustrating because, I mean,

604
00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>many people - and I at least,

605
00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.339
<v Tristan Nitot:>but I know people around me -

606
00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>thought that the web was a wonderful

607
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>promise.

608
00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>We hoped that open source would be

609
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>the answer to, you know, saving that

610
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>promise and make it happen.

611
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.154
<v Tristan Nitot:>And we hoped that AOL having deep

612
00:34:56.154 --> 00:35:02.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>pockets would help us and it didn't

613
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>happen.

614
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, we were disappointed.

615
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>And especially, you know, that promise was

616
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>not going to be fulfilled - the

617
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>promise of the web, you know.

618
00:35:13.254 --> 00:35:18.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>In retrospect, I find myself very naive,

619
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>maybe not that- a bit naive.

620
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Hopefully, I'm staying naive, which is good,

621
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:28.707
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think.

622
00:35:28.707 --> 00:35:33.916
<v Tristan Nitot:>Naive for thinking that the web is

623
00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:36.838
<v Tristan Nitot:>a wonderful thing and even if you

624
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.308
<v Tristan Nitot:>think about Facebook right after that, you'd

625
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>understand what I mean by naive, you

626
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.354
<v Tristan Nitot:>know.

627
00:35:42.354 --> 00:35:46.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>But there's a good part of the

628
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>web, which is carrying the promise.

629
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, we were seeing the moment

630
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>where the web was for everyone to

631
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>publish, to communicate, and if you communicate,

632
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>you understand each other better.

633
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then you think about Twitter and

634
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>realize this is not the case at

635
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>all but still.

636
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, it was disappointing that this

637
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>promise wouldn't happen and we had lost

638
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>our job.

639
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>The Mozilla Foundation was created in order

640
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>to carry the project and-

641
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.060
<v Heather Meeker:>And this was in the early 2000's,

642
00:36:35.061 --> 00:36:36.299
<v Heather Meeker:>is that right?

643
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:36.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Or...?

644
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yeah, I think it's mid 2003.

645
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:44.800
<v Heather Meeker:>Yeah, okay.

646
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I should have checked my dates before

647
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.746
<v Tristan Nitot:>but I think this is it.

648
00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:52.894
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think that the AOL Microsoft deal

649
00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:54.453
<v Tristan Nitot:>happened in June 2003.

650
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.861
<v Tristan Nitot:>We were laid off in mid-July.

651
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.046
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so what we're going to do,

652
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.361
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Mozilla Foundation which was just created

653
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>had the brand- you know, the right

654
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>to use the Mozilla Brand, which was,

655
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.448
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, good at least.

656
00:37:21.449 --> 00:37:23.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, we got it from from

657
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Netscape folks.

658
00:37:25.307 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>A few machines with the, you know,

659
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>servers and stuff with this whole scored

660
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>on it and hardware to make it

661
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>run.

662
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>A bit of cash but it was

663
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.714
<v Tristan Nitot:>like two million dollars.

664
00:37:42.715 --> 00:37:45.253
<v Tristan Nitot:>And not in one payment, in two

665
00:37:45.254 --> 00:37:45.823
<v Tristan Nitot:>payments.

666
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.600
<v Heather Meeker:>And the code.

667
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>And of course, the code, which was

668
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>open.

669
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And that was good.

670
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And with the money, they managed to

671
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.723
<v Tristan Nitot:>hire like eight people or something, less

672
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>than a dozen of the important folks

673
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.553
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Silicon Valley, which was good.

674
00:38:15.554 --> 00:38:18.115
<v Tristan Nitot:>But for us in Europe, nothing.

675
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.300
<v Heather Meeker:>Uh-huh.

676
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, you have to remember, there were

677
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>like, several hundreds Netscape employees working on

678
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Mozilla project.

679
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was like a vast majority

680
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>of them got laid off and only

681
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>a tiny part was rehired immediately by

682
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Mozilla Foundation.

683
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was a bit gloomy and

684
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>we thought we were doomed, and actually

685
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was the opposite.

686
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yeah.

687
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.592
<v Tristan Nitot:>In fact, maybe I'm just terrible at

688
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.160
<v Tristan Nitot:>understanding things!

689
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.846
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's never like I think it is!

690
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>I thought it was terrible and it

691
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:06.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>was actually a good thing because we

692
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>were able to bounce back, literally, like

693
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>hitting the floor and bounce back because

694
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>suddenly, we were not in the shadow

695
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>of AOL and suddenly we were we

696
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>were something important and we were a

697
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>bit helpless.

698
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>And that meant that some people were

699
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.715
<v Tristan Nitot:>interested in helping us, suddenly.

700
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>They wouldn't spend a dime or their

701
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>time to help something in the shadows

702
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>of AOL but suddenly, you know, if

703
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>you feel like you're gonna die, they

704
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>wouldn't see and your hand, which is

705
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>good.

706
00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, at the same time it

707
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>needs to be said, the Mozilla project

708
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:11.195
<v Tristan Nitot:>itself had decided - I don't know

709
00:40:11.195 --> 00:40:15.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>how to say that - but it

710
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.676
<v Tristan Nitot:>was very smart, but also unpleasant.

711
00:40:18.676 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, before this happened, we were trying

712
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>to attract a community of people that

713
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.115
<v Tristan Nitot:>could come and work on the project.

714
00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:41.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>And some of them were individuals and

715
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>some of them were professionals, like, IBM

716
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>employees, that came to work and which

717
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>were contracting with clients, and in between

718
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>contracts, they would come and spend some

719
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>time working with us.

720
00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, you know, at least they were

721
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>paid by the employer and employer said,

722
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>instead of not doing anything with the

723
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>client, you should spend your time on

724
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>doing this and that on, on the

725
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.015
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla project.

726
00:41:10.015 --> 00:41:12.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was good.

727
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>But everybody came and left and wanted

728
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.115
<v Tristan Nitot:>to leave their mark on the product.

729
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:26.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, like you want to do

730
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>that button that's, you know, is used

731
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>by probably like two percent of the

732
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>users but that's really cool.

733
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like, with this click, you could switch

734
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>off all the presentation and you see

735
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>the raw page.

736
00:41:41.254 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Isn't it beautiful if you can do

737
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:43.915
<v Tristan Nitot:>that?

738
00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like nobody's going to do that anyway,

739
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.361
<v Tristan Nitot:>but it's cool and it's my button!

740
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>You see?

741
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's not mine because I didn't do

742
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>that, but I've met many people that

743
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>really wanted to have their own button

744
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.714
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the product, or their own feature,

745
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>or their menu option or- yeah.

746
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>There were fights about what can be

747
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>put in a contextual menu when you

748
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.223
<v Tristan Nitot:>right-click on something.

749
00:42:07.223 --> 00:42:09.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Would be cool if my feature was

750
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Tristan Nitot:>there, you know?

751
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.408
<v Tristan Nitot:>Because it's visible and all that.

752
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, we were, we were trying

753
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>to attract people and at the same

754
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>time, it was really hard to keep

755
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>the product clean.

756
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>And to be honest, it was kind

757
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>of becoming a bit bloated because of

758
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.553
<v Tristan Nitot:>that.

759
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And there were a couple of people

760
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>who had a very strong opinion about

761
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>what a good product would look like.

762
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And that meant the product would have

763
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.461
<v Tristan Nitot:>to be simple.

764
00:42:41.461 --> 00:42:48.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And also, not every feature deserves to

765
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>be argued over and discussed forever.

766
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>I haven't really made up my mind

767
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>about all of this, you know.

768
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>I want people to participate, I want

769
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>to give them the UI space so

770
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.423
<v Tristan Nitot:>that there is their button displayed.

771
00:43:14.423 --> 00:43:18.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>At the same time, I know that

772
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>ordinary users are overwhelmed with too many

773
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.214
<v Tristan Nitot:>options.

774
00:43:22.215 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>When their contextual menu is two pages

775
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:32.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>long or dozens of things that pop

776
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.177
<v Tristan Nitot:>in their user interface.

777
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.508
<v Tristan Nitot:>I understand that, but like many people,

778
00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:42.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was mad when these couple of

779
00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:48.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>people started to remove user interface objects

780
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.471
<v Tristan Nitot:>from the user interface, you know.

781
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:51.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like this button gone!

782
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:53.053
<v Tristan Nitot:>This feature gone!

783
00:43:53.054 --> 00:43:55.154
<v Tristan Nitot:>This menu item gone!

784
00:43:55.154 --> 00:43:58.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And wait, wait, I did it myself,

785
00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, I had a lot of

786
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>hours, put into that thing and you're

787
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>basically spitting in my face, you know,

788
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.354
<v Tristan Nitot:>by removing my work.

789
00:44:09.354 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>You're killing my work just because you

790
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>decide this isn't cool.

791
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>This is not acceptable.

792
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, there were fights between the willingness

793
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>to include a lot of people in

794
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the open source way, and the willingness

795
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>to make a clean simplified product.

796
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:34.976
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then it wasn't pleasant, once again.

797
00:44:34.976 --> 00:44:39.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was hard to take off, you

798
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.150
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, make the community, take off and

799
00:44:41.175 --> 00:44:43.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>then there was these couple guys, you

800
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, killing it.

801
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, at the time, the two projects

802
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:59.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>went side-by-side and the clean and simplified

803
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.015
<v Tristan Nitot:>project became Firefox.

804
00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:04.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>But at the time, you have to

805
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>understand that Firefox wasn't cool at all

806
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.823
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the community.

807
00:45:09.823 --> 00:45:11.516
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, it wasn't called Firefox at the

808
00:45:11.516 --> 00:45:13.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>time, but what became Firefox was not

809
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>cool because of the way it was

810
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.214
<v Tristan Nitot:>managed.

811
00:45:16.215 --> 00:45:17.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>Which was the right way!

812
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:24.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>To be honest, if, you know, the

813
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>story, the end of the story, of

814
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>course they were right to do that.

815
00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:36.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>But it wasn't cool to see them

816
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>do that to the open source project,

817
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>and to the participation who many of

818
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>us wanted to see happening.

819
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And also, it was it was a

820
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>matter of power.

821
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>They could decide and we could just

822
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>see our work removed from the product.

823
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>That wasn't cool.

824
00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And there were, like, two things they

825
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.053
<v Tristan Nitot:>did that pretended to be nice.

826
00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:09.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>One is 'please don't comment in a

827
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>bug reports in Bugzilla, just use the

828
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.207
<v Tristan Nitot:>forums to do that'.

829
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.107
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yeah, go and start a forum thread

830
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>about this and so, you could yell

831
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>everything you wanted to, they never read

832
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>it, I'm sure.

833
00:46:22.754 --> 00:46:23.245
<v Tristan Nitot:>I know!

834
00:46:23.246 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>But I'm pretty sure they didn't read

835
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>anything at all.

836
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>And if there I weren't in these

837
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.753
<v Tristan Nitot:>shoes, I wouldn't read it, right?

838
00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:31.992
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like I don't read the comments in

839
00:46:31.992 --> 00:46:35.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the nowadays because I know, it's just

840
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:35.453
<v Tristan Nitot:>blah.

841
00:46:35.454 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>So they didn't go in places where

842
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>they were criticized.

843
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.353
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so they, they pretended the forums

844
00:46:45.354 --> 00:46:48.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>were the right place to discuss removals

845
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.546
<v Tristan Nitot:>of stuff, and then read it.

846
00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:52.254
<v Tristan Nitot:>And the second thing they did, which

847
00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>was really amazing, was the extension system.

848
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>Maybe I'm rewriting history, but I don't

849
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>think I am, is that when they

850
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>removed the buttons and widgets and stuff

851
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>from Firefox - what would became become

852
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Firefox - they said yes, but there

853
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>is now an extension mechanism that enables

854
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>you to write an extension.

855
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, if you want your button back,

856
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>you write an extension and you could

857
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>put back, basically copy paste your code

858
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.084
<v Tristan Nitot:>into the extension - was a bit

859
00:47:40.085 --> 00:47:44.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>of a lie but at least they

860
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>had something to respond - so you

861
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>put it in the extension and the

862
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>extension, you can add it manually into

863
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.214
<v Tristan Nitot:>your instance of the product.

864
00:47:53.215 --> 00:47:53.622
<v Heather Meeker:>Right.

865
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Tristan Nitot:>And extensions have been fantastic for Firefox

866
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:06.015
<v Tristan Nitot:>precisely because you could customize your browser.

867
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Heather Meeker:>And now all the browsers have them,

868
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Heather Meeker:>right?

869
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:09.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yes.

870
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.115
<v Tristan Nitot:>Exactly!

871
00:48:10.115 --> 00:48:15.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>And now, my current job today is

872
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.823
<v Tristan Nitot:>to write an extension.

873
00:48:16.823 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>I have a company around that which

874
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>is funny, pretty much 18 years later.

875
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Heather Meeker:>Well so, you mentioned the end of

876
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.500
<v Heather Meeker:>the story and I want to make

877
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.500
<v Heather Meeker:>sure that we get to the end

878
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.700
<v Heather Meeker:>of the story because I think when

879
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.300
<v Heather Meeker:>most people think about Firefox at least,

880
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Heather Meeker:>you know, during a period of about,

881
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.600
<v Heather Meeker:>I don't know ten years or so,

882
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.799
<v Heather Meeker:>they would probably call it a wild

883
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800
<v Heather Meeker:>success.

884
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.299
<v Heather Meeker:>So to tell me about, you know,

885
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Heather Meeker:>when Firefox launched, and it began to

886
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:57.000
<v Heather Meeker:>challenge Internet Explorer and so forth, you

887
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.100
<v Heather Meeker:>know, what are your thoughts about that?

888
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:11.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, so in July 2003, I get

889
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>laid off and the people in a

890
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>European offices, get laid off.

891
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And there is that promise of the

892
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>web, you know, which was basically delayed

893
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>by Internet Explorer.

894
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well by Microsoft, not willing to update

895
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Internet Explorer, not being interested in the

896
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>future of the web, right?

897
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>They were interested in stopping the web

898
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>because it was dangerous for the windows

899
00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Monopoly.

900
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was not good for the Microsoft

901
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>Office way of selling licenses.

902
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.462
<v Tristan Nitot:>In the, at the time.

903
00:49:51.462 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>You have to remember that it was,

904
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:59.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>you would buy shrink-wrapped CDs at Fry's

905
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>or, you know, a retail store and

906
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the idea of having software delivered to

907
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>you.

908
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>In a browser that was like super

909
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>dangerous to Microsoft business model and it

910
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>we've seen it took them years to

911
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>build Microsoft 365 and such how this

912
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>struggling with Microsoft, with Google Docs and

913
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>stuff competing with Google.

914
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, to some extent, they were

915
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>right and I don't think they were

916
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>on there.

917
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>They weren't on the good side of

918
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the moral story, but at least business

919
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>ways, they were, right.

920
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>But now that the web was stalling,

921
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>they were not interested in, you know,

922
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>making a modern browser and all of

923
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>that and so it was somebody else's

924
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>job to do it.

925
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>Except that there was no money to

926
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>be made.

927
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know with browser, because Internet Explorer

928
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>was still shipping with Windows and you

929
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>would get you know, what's the price

930
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.214
<v Tristan Nitot:>tag was set to zero forever.

931
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then so nobody who would be

932
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:17.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>interested in competing with with a product

933
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>with no money to be made in

934
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:18.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>a process.

935
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was more or less mozilla's

936
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>job to make it happen.

937
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And Mozilla was at a stop, you

938
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>know, so we decided and a couple

939
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.602
<v Tristan Nitot:>of friends and myself and a couple

940
00:51:37.602 --> 00:51:39.938
<v Tristan Nitot:>of people and new volunteered in the

941
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>community in Italy, in Poland in the

942
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>UK, in France, and Germany.

943
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>We loved the Mozilla project.

944
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:02.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>We knew that standalone browser, which became

945
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Firefox was in the pipes, you know,

946
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>being worked on.

947
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>Some of us, well, we ended up

948
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>everyone everyone understanding, it would work, but

949
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>we didn't realize all of us at

950
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>the same time, you know, it was

951
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>it happen over time, but "I think

952
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:29.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>that that Firefox thing is, maybe it's

953
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:29.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>going to take off.

954
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Maybe it's going to work." And so,

955
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>even if I don't have a job.

956
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>I'm going to help make it well

957
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>to life.

958
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>I will help delivering it to the

959
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.107
<v Tristan Nitot:>world.

960
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.931
<v Tristan Nitot:>We thought it would be in a

961
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>few months, so it was like a

962
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>over a few months and the French

963
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:06.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>law saying, you can't lay off someone

964
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>for at least three months.

965
00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>This, you get at least three months

966
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:11.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>severance.

967
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then you have an employment benefits

968
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>that there is a small period of

969
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>time where you don't have anything but

970
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was doing okay, so I thought

971
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>I'm going to do that in the

972
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.446
<v Tristan Nitot:>meantime, so I'm going to help the

973
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:41.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla Foundation to serve potential users in

974
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.823
<v Tristan Nitot:>Europe because I knew from experience that

975
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>it's really hard for a U.S.

976
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>organization to properly deliver an address users

977
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>and clients and customers in Europe because

978
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>it's so different.

979
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's so many well two cultures being

980
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>different languages being different, the need for

981
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>localization, you know, translating piece of software

982
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>making sure, quality assurance in the languages

983
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.953
<v Tristan Nitot:>is properly done, and all of that.

984
00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's complicated when you're Netscape.

985
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's a bit easier when you are

986
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>AOL, because you have more money, but

987
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>if your Mozilla foundation with eight employees,

988
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>not going to happen for sure.

989
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I thought who could do that

990
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>in Europe and, and like everybody, I

991
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>would talk to the old said, well

992
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Tristan, You're the guy.

993
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>Come on, I don't want to do

994
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>that.

995
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>I don't feel like I'm properly equipped

996
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.736
<v Tristan Nitot:>to, to do that.

997
00:54:50.736 --> 00:54:54.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, and so anyway, I would

998
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>gather people from different countries.

999
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>People that I knew that were involved

1000
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:06.012
<v Tristan Nitot:>in helping the Mozilla project in and

1001
00:55:06.012 --> 00:55:08.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>we decided we would make an organization

1002
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>to support that too.

1003
00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Make it real.

1004
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I ask who, well we need

1005
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>if it's a French non-profit.

1006
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>We need a president.

1007
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>That's the name of the job position

1008
00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>who who wants to be president and

1009
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>I didn't want to be present at

1010
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>all like and that's just that something

1011
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>happier than they ask for a volunteer

1012
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>and everybody steps back once except one.

1013
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>That was me.

1014
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, that's why I got, I

1015
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>got involved.

1016
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>In this, but they were right.

1017
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>It kind of makes sense, you know,

1018
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>maybe it was because I was at

1019
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>the least technical of all of them.

1020
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>So what was put in a place

1021
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>where I would do the less damage

1022
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>and and so we we did that,

1023
00:56:07.854 --> 00:56:11.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>hoping that Firefox would launch soon.

1024
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Unfortunately.

1025
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>It took us.

1026
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think 10 or 15 months to

1027
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>launch because it's software and that never

1028
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>happens on time and it which was

1029
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>a lot longer that I expected.

1030
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:36.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And that was not easy at all

1031
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>to do that because you know, that

1032
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>like the the French an employment agency

1033
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.560
<v Tristan Nitot:>was asking me whether I would sending

1034
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>resumes and, you know, and stuff like

1035
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>that or whether I was creating a

1036
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>company, and I was not creating a

1037
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.053
<v Tristan Nitot:>company, you know.

1038
00:57:00.054 --> 00:57:03.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>These are the two options, basically and

1039
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>then they were threatened to stop the

1040
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>benefits from coming.

1041
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I managed to be lucky enough

1042
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>to be discussing with a guy who

1043
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>was nice and an understanding and said,

1044
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.875
<v Tristan Nitot:>so you're building a non-profit?

1045
00:57:23.876 --> 00:57:27.076
<v Tristan Nitot:>"Yes, and we're going to crush Microsoft!"

1046
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>and yeah, yeah, sure.

1047
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>But and so, I would, I would

1048
00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>show him.

1049
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>Emails from Mitchell Baker and from the

1050
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla foundation and stuff like that.

1051
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>He wouldn't speak a word of English

1052
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>as a translate me.

1053
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>So I could have, you know,

1054
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.669
<v Heather Meeker:>You could have said anything?

1055
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Anything, but I did not.

1056
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was I was so yes, we

1057
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>were discussing, you know, so that we

1058
00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>could use the Mozilla brand and and

1059
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>stuff like that.

1060
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.007
<v Tristan Nitot:>And he said, "yeah, sure it's fine."

1061
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And in the end we ended up

1062
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>creating.

1063
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.644
<v Tristan Nitot:>hundreds of jobs in Europe, so it's

1064
00:58:08.644 --> 00:58:10.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>so he was right, but at the

1065
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>time it was a bit far-fetched to

1066
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>to believe me and believe that I

1067
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.415
<v Tristan Nitot:>would we succeed.

1068
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.492
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so, Firefox was making progress at

1069
00:58:24.492 --> 00:58:26.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>the same same time.

1070
00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:32.692
<v Tristan Nitot:>And even before it reached 1.0 as

1071
00:58:32.692 --> 00:58:38.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>a version, even by 0.8., It was,

1072
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was, it was crazy.

1073
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>People would adopt it.

1074
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>People would promote it.

1075
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>It would, it was the next cool

1076
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>thing.

1077
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was spending, probably a third of

1078
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.714
<v Tristan Nitot:>my time blogging about it and talking.

1079
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>I remember in a cafe in Paris,

1080
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>there were two guys in the next

1081
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>table who were discussing the web.

1082
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>I remember, chatting, "Have you heard that

1083
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Firefox?" You know, like they were this

1084
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>guy?

1085
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>No, never heard.

1086
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, you should try to know it's

1087
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.707
<v Tristan Nitot:>fun and it works.

1088
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.560
<v Tristan Nitot:>It really worked!

1089
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>And then the people in the UK

1090
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>and the Lance Poland, Italy, Germany, and

1091
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>France, they will be doing all the

1092
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>same.

1093
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:44.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And and to be honest it was

1094
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>it was almost too easy because the

1095
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>web developer were so Upset by Internet

1096
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Explorer.

1097
00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>What was a really terrible browser?

1098
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Like very, very buggy with full of

1099
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>security holes and let me get past

1100
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>and even if you broke proper HTML,

1101
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>it wouldn't displayed properly and stuff like

1102
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>that.

1103
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.482
<v Tristan Nitot:>And sothey were waiting for An alternative,

1104
01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:22.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>a better solution and and Firefox was

1105
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:27.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>well, could be, and it showed that

1106
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>it started to be the response to

1107
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>that.

1108
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was, it was delivering, really.

1109
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>It wasn't perfect at all.

1110
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>But in many cases, in many things,

1111
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>we were better than Internet Explorer, and

1112
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>we were showing constant improvement, newer versions,

1113
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>and it was cool.

1114
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.646
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was op.

1115
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>We were discussing web standards.

1116
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>So, you knowor what we call sometimes

1117
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>the quality web like the web done

1118
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:19.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>properly as we could make it, maybe

1119
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>an industry, you know, something serious.

1120
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Not just working around Internet Explorer bugs,

1121
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:34.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>but really make it proper decent job.

1122
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>Yeah, make the web nice make it,

1123
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.261
<v Tristan Nitot:>make it good and also open source.

1124
01:01:45.261 --> 01:01:50.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know, David versus Goliath.

1125
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was crazy.

1126
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>You know that the Mozilla foundation in

1127
01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Mozilla Europe.

1128
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>Both on profits were kicking Microsoft ass.

1129
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:08.799
<v Tristan Nitot:>It didn't seem possible, but it was

1130
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>happening and so people got excited.

1131
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>It.

1132
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Was that "Spread Firefox" campaign going on,

1133
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>where people were putting buttons to spread

1134
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Firefox and they were counters and so

1135
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>they would compete to bring the most

1136
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>downloads and stuff like that and there

1137
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>was a need., obviously there was a

1138
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>need for a better web browser with

1139
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>with tabs with extensions with support for

1140
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>the newest CSS features and also fast

1141
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.661
<v Tristan Nitot:>because it was completely rewritten and you

1142
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>know.

1143
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was, it was really cool.

1144
01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Basically, it became viral.

1145
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>I would say.

1146
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:12.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so I stayed there, making sure

1147
01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>that we would launch Firefox in Europe,

1148
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>probably even though I was kind of

1149
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:27.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>starving financially, but I made the commitment

1150
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.246
<v Tristan Nitot:>that I would help shape Firefox 10,

1151
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>and the unemployment agency was kind enough

1152
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>to let me do it, even though

1153
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>the unemployment benefits are as good as

1154
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>a, as a real paycheck.

1155
01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's still, it's still Money.

1156
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>So we made it work.

1157
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was, it was really, it was

1158
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>really cool.

1159
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was, it was amazing.

1160
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.315
<v Tristan Nitot:>I think that the open source movement

1161
01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:06.354
<v Tristan Nitot:>was also behind us, you know.

1162
01:04:06.354 --> 01:04:09.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was really two things, the web

1163
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>standards and web development.

1164
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>So web standards were hope for the

1165
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>forward-thinking web developers for some web developers.

1166
01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.307
<v Tristan Nitot:>That was, you know, one of these,

1167
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know things, one more thing to

1168
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>think about but some people were forward-thinking

1169
01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>enough to understand that maybe this is

1170
01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>going to be your job, easier, down

1171
01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>the road and be better considerated, and

1172
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, instead of dealing with bugs,

1173
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>but rather than dealing with features and

1174
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.207
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, interesting stuff.

1175
01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:47.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And also the open-source movement where they

1176
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:52.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>were was a lot of hope that

1177
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:56.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the Microsofts of the world would be

1178
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>replaced when they were in either with

1179
01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>something that was caring more about individuals.

1180
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so these two forces were helping

1181
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>us pushing us, and we were and

1182
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>then and the product was was in

1183
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>perfect position.

1184
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was really good.

1185
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was, it was really good.

1186
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>It wouldn't have happened if it was

1187
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.285
<v Tristan Nitot:>crap, and it was not no, I

1188
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>mean it.

1189
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Easy to make promises, but if you

1190
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>don't deliver people notice and we'll come

1191
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>back, and frankly we were competitive.

1192
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>While iut depends when.

1193
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>But at the beginning, we were barely

1194
01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>competitive.

1195
01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>We were competitive on some things and

1196
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>some not at all.

1197
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.210
<v Tristan Nitot:>So you have to carefully pick what

1198
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:03.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>you would demo.

1199
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:17.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>This brings me back to a moment.

1200
01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was still with Netscape.

1201
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>I Invited as a Netscape employee to

1202
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>deliver a talk about open source at

1203
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>a conference in Paris.

1204
01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I was demoing.

1205
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>So it was a bit bizarre was

1206
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.269
<v Tristan Nitot:>in the early days of the Netscape,

1207
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:44.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>well, the Mozilla project hosted by Netscape.

1208
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was the Gecko rendering engine.

1209
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>It was pretty much the only thing

1210
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>we had at the moment that would

1211
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.261
<v Tristan Nitot:>that worked.

1212
01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:57.530
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was shipping in the proprietary,

1213
01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Netscape Communicator user interface.

1214
01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>So when you looked at it you

1215
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>thought it was Netscape Communicator, except inside

1216
01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:12.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>the engine was Gecko and I did

1217
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>my slides with PowerPoint and exported to

1218
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>HTML and showed these in that Frankenstein

1219
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>version of a browser.

1220
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.537
<v Tristan Nitot:>And so I explained how we do

1221
01:07:28.537 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>this and that at Mozilla and Netscape

1222
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>and blah, blah, blah.

1223
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>And at the end, I said, by

1224
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.100
<v Tristan Nitot:>the way, you've seen Gecko running all

1225
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>along all that you've seen in that

1226
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>square part of the screen of the

1227
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>browser window was actually open source.

1228
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>People were suddenly excited like you see,

1229
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>they thought they were just, you know,

1230
01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>viewing slides by some marketing guy /

1231
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.553
<v Tristan Nitot:>moron, or you know.

1232
01:08:00.554 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>But still they were seeing open source

1233
01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>in action and then I did demos

1234
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>where I picked at it.

1235
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>Side-by-side demos of Netscape communicator and that

1236
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>Netscape Gecko version.

1237
01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I, of course, I picked examples

1238
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.992
<v Tristan Nitot:>where Gecko was better, and I showed

1239
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:24.495
<v Tristan Nitot:>them that.

1240
01:08:24.495 --> 01:08:26.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I asked them to count how

1241
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>many seconds it took.

1242
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Heather Meeker:>Communicator to render some very complex page.

1243
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Heather Meeker:>If I think it was 17 seconds,

1244
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.599
<v Heather Meeker:>my machine and it was less than

1245
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.000
<v Heather Meeker:>one second in the other piece of

1246
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:39.600
<v Heather Meeker:>software.

1247
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.899
<v Heather Meeker:>And this is the power of Open

1248
01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.399
<v Heather Meeker:>Source, you know, like everybody was crazy.

1249
01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.600
<v Heather Meeker:>It was like a concert of The

1250
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.399
<v Heather Meeker:>Rolling Stones.

1251
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.300
<v Heather Meeker:>I think some of them started breaking

1252
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.198
<v Heather Meeker:>chairs and stuff.

1253
01:08:50.198 --> 01:08:52.400
<v Heather Meeker:>I don't and I see this is

1254
01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:53.500
<v Heather Meeker:>what I want to do when I

1255
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.000
<v Heather Meeker:>grow old.

1256
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>And it was it was really where

1257
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.399
<v Tristan Nitot:>I decided I would go and, and,

1258
01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>and follow the Mozilla project for for

1259
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>a long time and which I did.

1260
01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And yeah, I got laid off in

1261
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>the middle and all of that.

1262
01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>But, yeah, it was something I hang

1263
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>onto because it was, it was so

1264
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:15.854
<v Tristan Nitot:>cool.

1265
01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:22.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I felt the impression of what,

1266
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>you know, people wanted to believe in

1267
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:24.899
<v Tristan Nitot:>open source.

1268
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:25.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Basically.

1269
01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.754
<v Tristan Nitot:>I was and it was cool.

1270
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.700
<v Heather Meeker:>That's a great story.

1271
01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:35.527
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, so we should probably that's it.

1272
01:09:35.528 --> 01:09:36.800
<v Heather Meeker:>I think that's a good note to

1273
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.099
<v Heather Meeker:>end on, but before we complete, this,

1274
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.599
<v Heather Meeker:>anything else you want to say about

1275
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.000
<v Heather Meeker:>open source and what it's meant to

1276
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.099
<v Heather Meeker:>you, or what you want to do

1277
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Heather Meeker:>in the future, anything you'd like to

1278
01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:49.799
<v Heather Meeker:>say.

1279
01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.315
<v Tristan Nitot:>Well, something I did not understand as

1280
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:05.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>a kid between proprietary software, I could

1281
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>steal or copy illegal copy and an

1282
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.599
<v Tristan Nitot:>open source.

1283
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Is that there's a huge difference.

1284
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>I didn't get it at the time

1285
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>and now maybe because I have gray

1286
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.546
<v Tristan Nitot:>hair, I get it.

1287
01:10:27.546 --> 01:10:36.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>And I think we're in 2021 and

1288
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>there is software and pretty much everything

1289
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:44.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>we touch, and which is very different

1290
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>from [19]96 when I started making web

1291
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:49.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>pages.

1292
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>It's very different from [19]90 or 91.

1293
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>When I started writing my first program

1294
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.207
<v Tristan Nitot:>in basic.

1295
01:11:00.207 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Now, there is software everywhere.

1296
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.292
<v Tristan Nitot:>And if I want to be free

1297
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:08.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>as a citizen, then I need free

1298
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.600
<v Tristan Nitot:>software.

1299
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.300
<v Tristan Nitot:>Because the guy who controls the software,

1300
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.400
<v Tristan Nitot:>kind of more or less controls my

1301
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.515
<v Tristan Nitot:>life decides.

1302
01:11:16.515 --> 01:11:21.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>Whether my, you know, garage door is

1303
01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.700
<v Tristan Nitot:>going to open or not.

1304
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.200
<v Tristan Nitot:>Whether my thermostat is going to work

1305
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.800
<v Tristan Nitot:>or not, whether my personal data of

1306
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.099
<v Tristan Nitot:>whether I'm in or out of the

1307
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>house is, shared or not and many,

1308
01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:38.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>many different things in my life.

1309
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.299
<v Tristan Nitot:>Some of them being very intimate.

1310
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.900
<v Tristan Nitot:>Can be shared or not.

1311
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>And if I want to have control

1312
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
<v Tristan Nitot:>over that or have someone, I trust

1313
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.500
<v Tristan Nitot:>control, have control over there.

1314
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.869
<v Tristan Nitot:>I need free software.

1315
01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.599
<v Heather Meeker:>That's a, that's a wonderful comment.

1316
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.500
<v Heather Meeker:>Well, so let's let's end.

1317
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.299
<v Heather Meeker:>I just wanted to thank you this

1318

<v Heather Meeker:>great talking to you.

1319
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.600
<v Heather Meeker:>I loved hearing the stories about the

1320
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.100
<v Heather Meeker:>early days of Netscape and Mozilla project.

1321
01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.600
<v Heather Meeker:>That's that's terrific.

1322
