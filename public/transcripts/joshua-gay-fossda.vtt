<v Karen Herman:>year 2023.

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.755
<v Karen Herman:>I'm Karen Herman, and I'm interviewing Joshua

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.623
<v Karen Herman:>Gay for the Free and Open Source

5
00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.168
<v Karen Herman:>Stories Digital Archive.

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.772
<v Karen Herman:>So welcome, Joshua.

7
00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:13.703
<v Karen Herman:>Thank you so much for for doing

8
00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:13.883
<v Karen Herman:>this.

9
00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:15.328
<v Karen Herman:>We're really excited to hear your story.

10
00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Karen Herman:>And I'm going to start right from

11
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.561
<v Karen Herman:>from the beginning.

12
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.747
<v Karen Herman:>Let me know where and when you

13
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:20.109
<v Karen Herman:>were born.

14
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.106
<v Joshua Gay:>I was born in just outside of

15
00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.302
<v Joshua Gay:>Boston, a small town, Hingham, Massachusetts in

16
00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:29.656
<v Joshua Gay:>1981.

17
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:38.364
<v Joshua Gay:>And I grew up there, lived lived

18
00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.468
<v Joshua Gay:>there my whole childhood.

19
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.912
<v Joshua Gay:>I'm one of six kids.

20
00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:46.737
<v Joshua Gay:>And, yeah.

21
00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Karen Herman:>What did your parents do?

22
00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:53.725
<v Joshua Gay:>Neither of my parents went to college.

23
00:00:55.207 --> 00:01:03.216
<v Joshua Gay:>My father had installed flooring and wall

24
00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.121
<v Joshua Gay:>to wall carpentry, his own business.

25
00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Joshua Gay:>My mom, most of her career, she

26
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.235
<v Joshua Gay:>worked as a mortgage officer in a

27
00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.861
<v Joshua Gay:>bank and small banks.

28
00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.672
<v Joshua Gay:>Before that, she, she sort of worked,

29
00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.956
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, sometimes multiple jobs here and

30
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Joshua Gay:>there.

31
00:01:29.063 --> 00:01:34.392
<v Joshua Gay:>Definitely lower middle class upbringing, but really

32
00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:38.262
<v Joshua Gay:>great tight knit family, really healthy home,

33
00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:42.029
<v Joshua Gay:>if not a very small home in

34
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.032
<v Joshua Gay:>a town with a lot of resources,

35
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:48.986
<v Joshua Gay:>and especially towards education and other things

36
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.692
<v Joshua Gay:>which which made it, you know, just

37
00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:53.103
<v Joshua Gay:>a really great place to grow up.

38
00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of kid would you say

39
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.791
<v Karen Herman:>you were?

40
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:03.531
<v Joshua Gay:>Oh, I think, you know, I think

41
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:04.812
<v Joshua Gay:>I kind of had two sides to

42
00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:05.012
<v Joshua Gay:>me.

43
00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.642
<v Joshua Gay:>I was maybe a little bit energetic

44
00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:10.067
<v Joshua Gay:>and get out the house and spend

45
00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.613
<v Joshua Gay:>all day out in the woods and

46
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Joshua Gay:>things like that growing up.

47
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.125
<v Joshua Gay:>In school, I think I was, you

48
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:23.633
<v Joshua Gay:>know, mostly quiet, polite, somewhat reserved.

49
00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:29.703
<v Joshua Gay:>I've always been extremely curious.

50
00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:36.492
<v Joshua Gay:>I've never been a very good student

51
00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:37.193
<v Joshua Gay:>per se.

52
00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:41.742
<v Joshua Gay:>And in terms of, you know, learning

53
00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:43.986
<v Joshua Gay:>along with the rest of my class

54
00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Joshua Gay:>or in the normal curriculum.

55
00:02:48.554 --> 00:02:50.621
<v Joshua Gay:>I did really like school, though.

56
00:02:51.863 --> 00:02:53.586
<v Joshua Gay:>I just didn't necessarily like learning at

57
00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.129
<v Joshua Gay:>the same pace.

58
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.221
<v Joshua Gay:>So I would often fail and then

59
00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:03.189
<v Joshua Gay:>and then get excited to learn whatever

60
00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.334
<v Joshua Gay:>it is I failed, and then sort

61
00:03:05.354 --> 00:03:07.081
<v Joshua Gay:>of catch up and sometimes we jump

62
00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:09.246
<v Joshua Gay:>ahead and a lot of, you know,

63
00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:10.588
<v Joshua Gay:>back and forth.

64
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.276
<v Joshua Gay:>And somehow I managed to make it

65
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.702
<v Joshua Gay:>all the way through and graduate high

66
00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:15.983
<v Joshua Gay:>school.

67
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.895
<v Joshua Gay:>And that trend continued all the way

68
00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:22.560
<v Joshua Gay:>through high school.

69
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.587
<v Joshua Gay:>I remember my AP European history teacher

70
00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:28.893
<v Joshua Gay:>telling me that, and he had been

71
00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:31.944
<v Joshua Gay:>teaching that course since it started at

72
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:32.726
<v Joshua Gay:>my high school.

73
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.211
<v Joshua Gay:>And he said I was the first

74
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Joshua Gay:>person to fail the course, get an

75
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.364
<v Joshua Gay:>F in the course, but to pass

76
00:03:39.404 --> 00:03:41.448
<v Joshua Gay:>the AP exam and get full credit

77
00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:42.029
<v Joshua Gay:>in college.

78
00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:47.101
<v Joshua Gay:>And that I think that, you know,

79
00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:53.151
<v Joshua Gay:>that sort of characterizes a lot of

80
00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:55.254
<v Joshua Gay:>how I went through school.

81
00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:58.502
<v Joshua Gay:>I fell behind in middle school, and

82
00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:00.146
<v Joshua Gay:>then I doubled up and tripled up

83
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:04.255
<v Joshua Gay:>sometimes courses in, you know, freshman and

84
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.743
<v Joshua Gay:>sophomore year in high school in order

85
00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.409
<v Joshua Gay:>to sort of be able to, you

86
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.933
<v Joshua Gay:>know, continue on a path where I

87
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.921
<v Joshua Gay:>was engaged and excited.

88
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:19.351
<v Joshua Gay:>And yeah, that was really, I think

89
00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Joshua Gay:>I was constantly distracted by other things

90
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.323
<v Joshua Gay:>in life outside of school as well.

91
00:04:27.106 --> 00:04:31.193
<v Joshua Gay:>And I started working pretty young.

92
00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:34.282
<v Joshua Gay:>I think my first little job was

93
00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:37.929
<v Joshua Gay:>in third grade raking leaves.

94
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.933
<v Joshua Gay:>And I think by fourth grade, I

95
00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:41.235
<v Joshua Gay:>was delivering newspapers.

96
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.585
<v Joshua Gay:>And by fifth grade, I was running,

97
00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:47.128
<v Joshua Gay:>I went from a lemonade stand to

98
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Joshua Gay:>a full concession stand on a golf

99
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.864
<v Joshua Gay:>course, a public golf course near my

100
00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:53.145
<v Joshua Gay:>house.

101
00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:55.892
<v Joshua Gay:>I would just drag out coolers of

102
00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Joshua Gay:>things and sell them.

103
00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:02.548
<v Joshua Gay:>And then after that, I started working

104
00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:08.416
<v Joshua Gay:>in catering at the same golf course,

105
00:05:08.596 --> 00:05:11.883
<v Joshua Gay:>a country club events.

106
00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:17.209
<v Joshua Gay:>And I tend to work around anywhere

107
00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:19.412
<v Joshua Gay:>from, you know, 15 to 40 hours

108
00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:24.241
<v Joshua Gay:>a week, even during the school year

109
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.583
<v Joshua Gay:>and the summers, I would usually have

110
00:05:26.124 --> 00:05:26.905
<v Joshua Gay:>more than one job.

111
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Joshua Gay:>And so that has continued my entire

112
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.601
<v Joshua Gay:>life.

113
00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:36.966
<v Joshua Gay:>I've never stopped working really.

114
00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:41.875
<v Joshua Gay:>Up until recently, sort of the idea

115
00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:46.387
<v Joshua Gay:>of just working one job was, I

116
00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:49.092
<v Joshua Gay:>think it took becoming a parent, where

117
00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:50.675
<v Joshua Gay:>I said, "oh, that's its own full

118
00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:52.181
<v Joshua Gay:>time job in a sense that I

119
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.509
<v Joshua Gay:>can just have one other employer or,

120
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.775
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, focus area." But definitely throughout

121
00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:02.604
<v Joshua Gay:>my childhood, I was constantly working in

122
00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:07.815
<v Joshua Gay:>addition to doing extracurricular activities, and playing

123
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.850
<v Joshua Gay:>sports and trying.

124
00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:12.127
<v Karen Herman:>Did you have any interest in that

125
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:13.753
<v Karen Herman:>at that time?

126
00:06:15.663 --> 00:06:16.624
<v Joshua Gay:>No, not at all.

127
00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:18.708
<v Joshua Gay:>I mean, if I had to rank

128
00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:22.854
<v Joshua Gay:>anything interest, baseball was my number one

129
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.260
<v Joshua Gay:>interest until I was about 17 or

130
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.506
<v Joshua Gay:>18.

131
00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:29.513
<v Joshua Gay:>I developed a strong interest in poetry

132
00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:30.325
<v Joshua Gay:>around age 14.

133
00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:32.127
<v Karen Herman:>In writing it?

134
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.162
<v Joshua Gay:>In writing it and reading it.

135
00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:42.253
<v Joshua Gay:>I continue to love to read poetry

136
00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:43.776
<v Joshua Gay:>and write on my own.

137
00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Joshua Gay:>I don't really publish anymore.

138
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:51.612
<v Joshua Gay:>I mean, I remember kind of being

139
00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:52.193
<v Joshua Gay:>intrigued.

140
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:53.956
<v Joshua Gay:>In the first moment, I kind of

141
00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.343
<v Joshua Gay:>got intrigued by computer science.

142
00:06:56.404 --> 00:07:01.953
<v Joshua Gay:>There's TI-82 calculators, what we used or

143
00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.736
<v Joshua Gay:>what I had for school.

144
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.467
<v Joshua Gay:>And a friend of mine who was

145
00:07:10.507 --> 00:07:11.848
<v Joshua Gay:>also one of the first people I

146
00:07:11.888 --> 00:07:15.612
<v Joshua Gay:>knew to run Linux back in the

147
00:07:15.652 --> 00:07:21.202
<v Joshua Gay:>90s, he introduced me to the world

148
00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:23.548
<v Joshua Gay:>of programming on a calculator in high

149
00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:23.869
<v Joshua Gay:>school.

150
00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:27.683
<v Joshua Gay:>Just started out with little things, you

151
00:07:27.703 --> 00:07:29.948
<v Joshua Gay:>know, here's a way to just sort

152
00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:32.193
<v Joshua Gay:>of store notes or to write a

153
00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Joshua Gay:>little game, a choose your own adventure

154
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:34.521
<v Joshua Gay:>type game.

155
00:07:35.943 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Joshua Gay:>And then what really got me a

156
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.931
<v Joshua Gay:>little bit excited was he wrote a

157
00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:50.009
<v Joshua Gay:>fractal generator and it didn't support imaginary

158
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.410
<v Joshua Gay:>numbers.

159
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:51.493
<v Joshua Gay:>I remember him telling me and I

160
00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.664
<v Joshua Gay:>didn't quite understand what that was because

161
00:07:53.684 --> 00:07:55.328
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't really understand fractals at the

162
00:07:55.368 --> 00:07:55.628
<v Joshua Gay:>time.

163
00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:59.662
<v Joshua Gay:>But he showed me how he worked

164
00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:02.669
<v Joshua Gay:>around this and did sort of all

165
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:03.311
<v Joshua Gay:>of these things.

166
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:05.155
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was like, you just did

167
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:06.361
<v Joshua Gay:>that on your calculator.

168
00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:11.892
<v Joshua Gay:>And it's generating these different pictures and

169
00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:12.574
<v Joshua Gay:>things like that.

170
00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:14.341
<v Joshua Gay:>And zooming in.

171
00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:18.269
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was really kind of captivated

172
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.715
<v Joshua Gay:>by that idea that you could, you

173
00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:23.947
<v Joshua Gay:>know, that anybody could just sit there

174
00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:26.153
<v Joshua Gay:>and write something like that and it

175
00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:26.834
<v Joshua Gay:>would make it work.

176
00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:33.091
<v Joshua Gay:>For the most part, my interest in

177
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:35.355
<v Joshua Gay:>computers, though, in high school was graphic

178
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:35.736
<v Joshua Gay:>design.

179
00:08:38.663 --> 00:08:43.209
<v Joshua Gay:>One of the things that sort of,

180
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.173
<v Joshua Gay:>I guess, probably helped me get into

181
00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:47.740
<v Joshua Gay:>college was I won a regional graphic

182
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.344
<v Joshua Gay:>design contest.

183
00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:56.514
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't, so there was a graphics

184
00:08:56.634 --> 00:08:59.422
<v Joshua Gay:>arts class and one of the portions

185
00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:01.747
<v Joshua Gay:>of it was in addition to making

186
00:09:02.048 --> 00:09:05.715
<v Joshua Gay:>printed things and using the big sort

187
00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:07.924
<v Joshua Gay:>of industrial printer that we had and

188
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:13.274
<v Joshua Gay:>whatnot was learning to use things like

189
00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:14.196
<v Joshua Gay:>Adobe Photoshop.

190
00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:18.627
<v Joshua Gay:>I remember I made a, I think,

191
00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:23.195
<v Joshua Gay:>the Leonardo da Vinci, is it Petruvian

192
00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:24.075
<v Joshua Gay:>man, is that right?

193
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.407
<v Joshua Gay:>Sort of in the circle and the

194
00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:29.689
<v Joshua Gay:>arms and the leg.

195
00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:32.134
<v Joshua Gay:>I took that and I manipulated it

196
00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:33.841
<v Joshua Gay:>and did, you know, sort of a

197
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.264
<v Joshua Gay:>creative project.

198
00:09:36.246 --> 00:09:38.131
<v Joshua Gay:>And I didn't realize that when I

199
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Joshua Gay:>submitted it that my teacher was going

200
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.183
<v Joshua Gay:>to go ahead and submit it on

201
00:09:41.224 --> 00:09:43.069
<v Joshua Gay:>my behalf to this regional contest.

202
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.040
<v Joshua Gay:>And he did and I happened to

203
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.583
<v Joshua Gay:>win, which was pretty nice of him

204
00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:50.367
<v Joshua Gay:>to just go ahead and do that.

205
00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:54.793
<v Joshua Gay:>And then in 10th or 11th grade,

206
00:10:00.203 --> 00:10:02.848
<v Joshua Gay:>I taught in an after school program

207
00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.209
<v Joshua Gay:>in our middle school, HTML 1.0.

208
00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.136
<v Joshua Gay:>So I learned how to make web

209
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.866
<v Joshua Gay:>pages and things when HTML first came

210
00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:10.086
<v Joshua Gay:>out.

211
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.872
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't think of it as programming.

212
00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:14.882
<v Joshua Gay:>I just thought of it as more

213
00:10:14.922 --> 00:10:20.091
<v Joshua Gay:>like making, you know, like graphic design,

214
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:23.236
<v Joshua Gay:>like, you know, putting together very much

215
00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:24.622
<v Joshua Gay:>a a front end mentality, right?

216
00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:28.809
<v Joshua Gay:>I wasn't thinking I'm making computers do

217
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Joshua Gay:>things.

218
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.584
<v Joshua Gay:>I'm displaying, you know, text and art

219
00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.049
<v Joshua Gay:>and colors.

220
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:40.914
<v Karen Herman:>Did you really learn it yourself?

221
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:41.936
<v Karen Herman:>Did you teach it to yourself?

222
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:43.904
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, yeah, I did.

223
00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:45.907
<v Joshua Gay:>I know that we had like a

224
00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:49.254
<v Joshua Gay:>short media studies thing where we had

225
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.205
<v Joshua Gay:>like a couple days in the library

226
00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:54.911
<v Joshua Gay:>where we were introduced to it and

227
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.493
<v Joshua Gay:>some program that you could use to

228
00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:59.605
<v Joshua Gay:>make, some early program that you could

229
00:10:59.665 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Joshua Gay:>use to make a website, some sort

230
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.212
<v Joshua Gay:>of page maker.

231
00:11:03.232 --> 00:11:08.507
<v Joshua Gay:>But when I taught the class, I

232
00:11:08.727 --> 00:11:11.633
<v Joshua Gay:>just had everybody write the HTML.

233
00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:13.140
<v Joshua Gay:>And so I learned, you know, what

234
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.147
<v Joshua Gay:>was happening underneath the website and how

235
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:16.649
<v Joshua Gay:>to do that.

236
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.660
<v Joshua Gay:>I don't remember it being anything that

237
00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:22.146
<v Joshua Gay:>I don't remember the learning part.

238
00:11:22.668 --> 00:11:24.172
<v Joshua Gay:>It was just, oh, how does this

239
00:11:24.212 --> 00:11:24.473
<v Joshua Gay:>work?

240
00:11:24.533 --> 00:11:25.922
<v Joshua Gay:>And then I figured it out.

241
00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:28.108
<v Joshua Gay:>And so there was always that kind

242
00:11:28.168 --> 00:11:30.253
<v Joshua Gay:>of desire to tinker, I think.

243
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.601
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

244
00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:32.186
<v Karen Herman:>What did you think you wanted to

245
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:32.446
<v Karen Herman:>be?

246
00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:34.292
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of career path were you

247
00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:35.746
<v Karen Herman:>thinking when you were in high school?

248
00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:38.687
<v Joshua Gay:>When I first got in, I had

249
00:11:38.707 --> 00:11:40.812
<v Joshua Gay:>a goal that I just basically wanted

250
00:11:40.852 --> 00:11:41.875
<v Joshua Gay:>to be a multimillionaire.

251
00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.609
<v Joshua Gay:>I was working all the time and

252
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:46.672
<v Joshua Gay:>I was working on a golf course

253
00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:48.100
<v Joshua Gay:>when I was in middle school, right,

254
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.505
<v Joshua Gay:>on my own and being a young

255
00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.108
<v Joshua Gay:>entrepreneur, I was called often.

256
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:57.963
<v Joshua Gay:>And there was an investor, sort of

257
00:11:58.003 --> 00:12:01.351
<v Joshua Gay:>a personal finance person from Smith Barney,

258
00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.015
<v Joshua Gay:>who said, "you should come down to

259
00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:04.723
<v Joshua Gay:>the office and open up, you know,

260
00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:07.852
<v Joshua Gay:>an investment account with us." And I

261
00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.501
<v Joshua Gay:>remember doing that in eighth grade.

262
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.464
<v Joshua Gay:>And I got a reading list of

263
00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:15.113
<v Joshua Gay:>a book went up on Wall Street

264
00:12:15.153 --> 00:12:16.015
<v Joshua Gay:>and some other things.

265
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.723
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was going to be a

266
00:12:17.783 --> 00:12:19.486
<v Joshua Gay:>value investor like Warren Buffett.

267
00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:23.372
<v Joshua Gay:>And that was fun.

268
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.081
<v Joshua Gay:>And I still have, you know, some

269
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:29.628
<v Joshua Gay:>investments from that day that are accruing,

270
00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:30.228
<v Joshua Gay:>which is nice.

271
00:12:31.692 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Joshua Gay:>But I kind of lost interest in

272
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.122
<v Joshua Gay:>that by tenth grade.

273
00:12:36.684 --> 00:12:40.369
<v Joshua Gay:>Poetry and sort of creative work was

274
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.492
<v Joshua Gay:>an interest.

275
00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:47.443
<v Joshua Gay:>But, you know, I really didn't know

276
00:12:47.503 --> 00:12:48.023
<v Joshua Gay:>for sure.

277
00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:51.950
<v Joshua Gay:>What kind of set me on my

278
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.834
<v Joshua Gay:>path was I found a school that,

279
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.084
<v Joshua Gay:>a college that I had a chance

280
00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:00.887
<v Joshua Gay:>of getting into with poor grades.

281
00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:05.875
<v Joshua Gay:>And I toured it.

282
00:13:06.236 --> 00:13:07.381
<v Joshua Gay:>I remember I set up the tour

283
00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:11.390
<v Joshua Gay:>on my own because my parents hadn't

284
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.755
<v Joshua Gay:>really, you know, had any experience in

285
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.501
<v Joshua Gay:>how to do that.

286
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:15.663
<v Joshua Gay:>So I remember I went ahead and

287
00:13:15.683 --> 00:13:22.154
<v Joshua Gay:>just took a bus to the train

288
00:13:22.174 --> 00:13:24.401
<v Joshua Gay:>into Boston from the suburbs where I

289
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:27.427
<v Joshua Gay:>lived and towards Suffolk University.

290
00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:32.356
<v Joshua Gay:>And I had, there was an undergraduate

291
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.784
<v Joshua Gay:>admissions counselor who took time to sit

292
00:13:34.824 --> 00:13:38.792
<v Joshua Gay:>and talk and look at your transcript

293
00:13:38.872 --> 00:13:41.542
<v Joshua Gay:>and give you some suggestions if you

294
00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:42.324
<v Joshua Gay:>wanted to apply.

295
00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:45.852
<v Joshua Gay:>And I remember he saw the graphic

296
00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:47.339
<v Joshua Gay:>arts award that I had won.

297
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.907
<v Joshua Gay:>And he said, "well, you know, your

298
00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:55.012
<v Joshua Gay:>GPA isn't great.

299
00:13:55.332 --> 00:13:57.716
<v Joshua Gay:>You have some good, your testing is

300
00:13:57.816 --> 00:13:58.117
<v Joshua Gay:>okay.

301
00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:02.586
<v Joshua Gay:>But it's going to be hard with

302
00:14:02.606 --> 00:14:06.993
<v Joshua Gay:>your GPA and your class rank to

303
00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:09.579
<v Joshua Gay:>get into an English program", because I

304
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.603
<v Joshua Gay:>wanted to do creative writing.

305
00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:13.792
<v Joshua Gay:>And he saw the graphic arts award

306
00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:16.745
<v Joshua Gay:>and he suggested, but we recently just

307
00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:19.251
<v Joshua Gay:>started a computer science program and we

308
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.915
<v Joshua Gay:>have almost nobody applying.

309
00:14:21.802 --> 00:14:23.766
<v Joshua Gay:>And so if you apply direct to

310
00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:26.911
<v Joshua Gay:>major for computer science, your odds will

311
00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:30.103
<v Joshua Gay:>be much higher because we have almost

312
00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:32.048
<v Joshua Gay:>nobody applying for that major.

313
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:34.132
<v Joshua Gay:>And so that's what I did.

314
00:14:34.153 --> 00:14:34.814
<v Joshua Gay:>And I got in.

315
00:14:36.884 --> 00:14:39.650
<v Joshua Gay:>And I remember I immediately persuaded the

316
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:44.284
<v Joshua Gay:>poetry professor, Fred Marchant, who's a Boston

317
00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:47.571
<v Joshua Gay:>poet, a conscientious objector to the Vietnam

318
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:49.775
<v Joshua Gay:>War and sort of a leader of

319
00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:51.924
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of the poetry community in New

320
00:14:51.964 --> 00:14:52.325
<v Joshua Gay:>England.

321
00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Joshua Gay:>He's a really fabulous person.

322
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Joshua Gay:>I kind of begged him to get

323
00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Joshua Gay:>into an upper level, 300 level poetry

324
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.534
<v Joshua Gay:>workshop class that he was running.

325
00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:05.586
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was like, well, you know,

326
00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:07.372
<v Joshua Gay:>I have this computer science major thing,

327
00:15:07.412 --> 00:15:09.423
<v Joshua Gay:>but now I'm in.

328
00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Joshua Gay:>I can look to making the switch

329
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.491
<v Joshua Gay:>eventually.

330
00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:15.896
<v Joshua Gay:>But it turned out that I had

331
00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:17.521
<v Joshua Gay:>a knack for computer science and I

332
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:23.470
<v Joshua Gay:>had a really good professor in my

333
00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:28.477
<v Joshua Gay:>first, in my fall, my kind of

334
00:15:28.477 --> 00:15:33.165
<v Joshua Gay:>a of a software engineering 101 or

335
00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:33.846
<v Joshua Gay:>whatever it was.

336
00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:43.416
<v Joshua Gay:>And he, Lewis Barton, he recently passed,

337
00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:47.286
<v Joshua Gay:>but he came to computer science late

338
00:15:47.326 --> 00:15:50.531
<v Joshua Gay:>in life, came back to it.

339
00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:52.515
<v Joshua Gay:>And he was just really excited to

340
00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:56.087
<v Joshua Gay:>help people who had any kind of

341
00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:59.354
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of different background, I think, be

342
00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:01.705
<v Joshua Gay:>able to make it in computer science.

343
00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:03.391
<v Joshua Gay:>And he kind of viewed himself with

344
00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:05.082
<v Joshua Gay:>that different background where where he meandered

345
00:16:05.122 --> 00:16:07.507
<v Joshua Gay:>for many years before coming back to

346
00:16:07.528 --> 00:16:09.954
<v Joshua Gay:>academia and was really looking for bright

347
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.741
<v Joshua Gay:>students.

348
00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:15.631
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was lucky that I did

349
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.091
<v Joshua Gay:>pretty well.

350
00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:19.723
<v Joshua Gay:>I ended up winning that, my freshman

351
00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:22.530
<v Joshua Gay:>year, their first year computer science award,

352
00:16:23.212 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Joshua Gay:>which, you know, it's a small class,

353
00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:27.507
<v Joshua Gay:>obviously, so it wasn't that big of

354
00:16:27.527 --> 00:16:28.269
<v Joshua Gay:>an accomplishment.

355
00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:30.735
<v Joshua Gay:>But for me, it was a big

356
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.361
<v Joshua Gay:>accomplishment.

357
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:34.967
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't think that I would be

358
00:16:35.047 --> 00:16:40.035
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of exceptional at it when I

359
00:16:40.075 --> 00:16:40.896
<v Joshua Gay:>first started.

360
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.047
<v Joshua Gay:>I had a really good friend who

361
00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:47.335
<v Joshua Gay:>was going to Northeastern University, Richard Buckman,

362
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:54.750
<v Joshua Gay:>and he spent a lot of time,

363
00:16:55.691 --> 00:16:59.776
<v Joshua Gay:>evenings, just sort of passionately, you know,

364
00:16:59.857 --> 00:17:01.983
<v Joshua Gay:>showing me cool things about the C

365
00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:04.387
<v Joshua Gay:>programming language and, you know, how it

366
00:17:04.426 --> 00:17:04.727
<v Joshua Gay:>worked.

367
00:17:04.988 --> 00:17:10.177
<v Joshua Gay:>And he was, we were friends since

368
00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:10.922
<v Joshua Gay:>high school.

369
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.847
<v Joshua Gay:>And him and I had a lot

370
00:17:14.027 --> 00:17:17.273
<v Joshua Gay:>of kind of in common with just

371
00:17:17.733 --> 00:17:19.300
<v Joshua Gay:>loving to learn things on our own,

372
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.723
<v Joshua Gay:>not necessarily for a reason.

373
00:17:20.923 --> 00:17:24.589
<v Joshua Gay:>And he learned the C programming language

374
00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:28.602
<v Joshua Gay:>before he really had the opportunity to

375
00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:30.226
<v Joshua Gay:>program.

376
00:17:31.388 --> 00:17:32.591
<v Joshua Gay:>I think he might have taught himself

377
00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:33.453
<v Joshua Gay:>at a middle school.

378
00:17:33.493 --> 00:17:35.623
<v Joshua Gay:>And he taught himself it from the

379
00:17:35.683 --> 00:17:38.832
<v Joshua Gay:>language definition, which is called the Bacchus-Naur

380
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:39.133
<v Joshua Gay:>form.

381
00:17:39.173 --> 00:17:42.005
<v Joshua Gay:>It's just sort of this very rigid,

382
00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:45.132
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, definition of the language without

383
00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:47.221
<v Joshua Gay:>any practical, how do you actually use

384
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:47.380
<v Joshua Gay:>it?

385
00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:51.749
<v Joshua Gay:>But that's sort of how he approached

386
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.250
<v Joshua Gay:>things.

387
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Joshua Gay:>He could learn the fundamentals and the

388
00:17:55.421 --> 00:17:58.309
<v Joshua Gay:>principles and then start pulling in examples

389
00:17:58.389 --> 00:17:59.251
<v Joshua Gay:>and being able to run.

390
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.543
<v Joshua Gay:>And he sort of, that kind of

391
00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:03.989
<v Joshua Gay:>joy of doing it with him in

392
00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:06.154
<v Joshua Gay:>the evenings and this very supportive professor

393
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.985
<v Joshua Gay:>during the day, you know, was a

394
00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:12.371
<v Joshua Gay:>great way to not only feel like

395
00:18:12.412 --> 00:18:14.660
<v Joshua Gay:>I was doing well academically and picking

396
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.005
<v Joshua Gay:>it up, but I really ran way,

397
00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:20.512
<v Joshua Gay:>way ahead of, you know, what would

398
00:18:20.652 --> 00:18:23.983
<v Joshua Gay:>typically, where you'd end your freshman year

399
00:18:24.043 --> 00:18:26.367
<v Joshua Gay:>of college and computer science.

400
00:18:26.488 --> 00:18:30.476
<v Joshua Gay:>I ended up getting a job after

401
00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:34.506
<v Joshua Gay:>my freshman year at a startup in

402
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:37.413
<v Joshua Gay:>Cambridge, Massachusetts programming.

403
00:18:37.473 --> 00:18:39.441
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, that was a pretty

404
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.126
<v Joshua Gay:>quick from zero to...

405
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.431
<v Joshua Gay:>Where was that?

406
00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.424
<v Joshua Gay:>The name of the company was Super

407
00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:50.026
<v Joshua Gay:>Wings Inc.

408
00:18:50.847 --> 00:18:52.129
<v Joshua Gay:>in Cambridge, Mass.

409
00:18:52.511 --> 00:18:53.733
<v Joshua Gay:>I think they might have been based

410
00:18:53.813 --> 00:18:56.322
<v Joshua Gay:>in Waltham or somewhere else, but they

411
00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:57.346
<v Joshua Gay:>had a satellite office.

412
00:18:57.888 --> 00:18:59.812
<v Joshua Gay:>They called it the R&D office where

413
00:18:59.893 --> 00:19:03.344
<v Joshua Gay:>myself and my good friend Rich worked

414
00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:05.849
<v Joshua Gay:>and some other people that were in

415
00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Joshua Gay:>college.

416
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:10.521
<v Joshua Gay:>And yeah, we got to do kind

417
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:13.927
<v Joshua Gay:>of the, just that sort of the

418
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:17.915
<v Joshua Gay:>research and development type project, sort of

419
00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Joshua Gay:>new product development.

420
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:24.129
<v Joshua Gay:>And that was really cool.

421
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:27.094
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, there were ambitious, hard things,

422
00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:30.265
<v Joshua Gay:>but, you know, how how can you,

423
00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:32.650
<v Joshua Gay:>here's the problem, here's the opportunity.

424
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.155
<v Joshua Gay:>And then we were able to actually

425
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.345
<v Joshua Gay:>create at least a couple of products

426
00:19:38.186 --> 00:19:39.169
<v Joshua Gay:>during my time there.

427
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.883
<v Joshua Gay:>And then the bubble burst during the

428
00:19:43.923 --> 00:19:46.148
<v Joshua Gay:>dot-com boom and then the bubble burst.

429
00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:49.955
<v Joshua Gay:>And that's where that company lost all

430
00:19:49.975 --> 00:19:51.423
<v Joshua Gay:>of its money and sort of ran

431
00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:51.984
<v Joshua Gay:>out of steam.

432
00:19:52.004 --> 00:19:55.773
<v Karen Herman:>But you were working there during college

433
00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Karen Herman:>or still going to school?

434
00:19:59.083 --> 00:19:59.363
<v Joshua Gay:>Yes.

435
00:19:59.904 --> 00:20:00.665
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

436
00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:05.631
<v Joshua Gay:>The fall of my sophomore year, I

437
00:20:06.453 --> 00:20:07.395
<v Joshua Gay:>was still attending.

438
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.542
<v Joshua Gay:>I had worked, I was working at

439
00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:12.785
<v Joshua Gay:>Super Wings.

440
00:20:15.008 --> 00:20:19.134
<v Joshua Gay:>I was accepted as a special student

441
00:20:19.374 --> 00:20:21.457
<v Joshua Gay:>at MIT, which you sort of have

442
00:20:21.477 --> 00:20:23.704
<v Joshua Gay:>to do the school application for and

443
00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:27.610
<v Joshua Gay:>you get a student ID and access

444
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:28.293
<v Joshua Gay:>to everything.

445
00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:31.563
<v Joshua Gay:>But it's a special student status.

446
00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:35.150
<v Joshua Gay:>And I took a graduate course, the

447
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Joshua Gay:>theory of computation with Michael Sipser.

448
00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:39.304
<v Joshua Gay:>I was trying to kind of beef

449
00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:44.915
<v Joshua Gay:>up my academic profile with the plan

450
00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:45.456
<v Joshua Gay:>of transferring.

451
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.866
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was also taking my full

452
00:20:47.966 --> 00:20:50.131
<v Joshua Gay:>course load at Suffolk University in the

453
00:20:50.172 --> 00:20:50.694
<v Joshua Gay:>fall as well.

454
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:52.462
<v Joshua Gay:>So it was a lot.

455
00:20:53.464 --> 00:20:54.284
<v Karen Herman:>But you were all in.

456
00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:54.385
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

457
00:20:54.405 --> 00:20:57.629
<v Joshua Gay:>I had made that transition 100% at

458
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.110
<v Joshua Gay:>that point.

459
00:21:04.902 --> 00:21:06.564
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

460
00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:13.954
<v Joshua Gay:>It seemed better than maybe a path

461
00:21:14.034 --> 00:21:15.536
<v Joshua Gay:>of being a poet and working in

462
00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.037
<v Joshua Gay:>restaurants.

463
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:22.867
<v Joshua Gay:>And not so much that I liked

464
00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:25.830
<v Joshua Gay:>it more than I liked poetry and

465
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:32.377
<v Joshua Gay:>literature, but it seemed like I didn't

466
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.923
<v Joshua Gay:>have to give up poetry.

467
00:21:36.569 --> 00:21:38.533
<v Joshua Gay:>That I could do all of these

468
00:21:38.593 --> 00:21:39.935
<v Joshua Gay:>things that opened up a whole world

469
00:21:39.976 --> 00:21:44.828
<v Joshua Gay:>of possibilities with creativity as well.

470
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.336
<v Karen Herman:>So when was the first time that

471
00:21:49.356 --> 00:21:51.263
<v Karen Herman:>you heard of free and open source?

472
00:21:52.966 --> 00:21:54.027
<v Joshua Gay:>It was around that time.

473
00:21:54.047 --> 00:21:58.355
<v Joshua Gay:>I think I had heard people talk

474
00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:05.568
<v Joshua Gay:>about things like Red Hat Linux and

475
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.011
<v Joshua Gay:>free software.

476
00:22:08.772 --> 00:22:16.646
<v Joshua Gay:>But it wasn't until I really started

477
00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Joshua Gay:>to look into it for the job

478
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.754
<v Joshua Gay:>I was working at Super Wings.

479
00:22:22.043 --> 00:22:26.509
<v Joshua Gay:>We had a mix of proprietary tool

480
00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:28.031
<v Joshua Gay:>chains that we were using.

481
00:22:28.592 --> 00:22:31.676
<v Joshua Gay:>And then if I just needed some

482
00:22:31.716 --> 00:22:33.724
<v Joshua Gay:>things and not have to go through

483
00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:37.533
<v Joshua Gay:>any procurement or anything, I started discovering

484
00:22:37.613 --> 00:22:38.660
<v Joshua Gay:>that there was this was this whole

485
00:22:38.961 --> 00:22:42.606
<v Joshua Gay:>GNU system and tools available.

486
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:49.376
<v Joshua Gay:>And I also started to encounter challenges

487
00:22:49.616 --> 00:22:54.628
<v Joshua Gay:>with proprietary software or even things that

488
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.334
<v Joshua Gay:>were sort of heading towards the direction

489
00:22:58.354 --> 00:22:59.015
<v Joshua Gay:>of open source.

490
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.423
<v Joshua Gay:>We did a lot of things in

491
00:23:00.483 --> 00:23:00.924
<v Joshua Gay:>Java.

492
00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:03.090
<v Joshua Gay:>And I remember having to reverse engineer

493
00:23:03.231 --> 00:23:05.583
<v Joshua Gay:>classes from the Java libraries that Sun

494
00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:06.065
<v Joshua Gay:>released.

495
00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:08.291
<v Joshua Gay:>And they hadn't yet released the source

496
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:12.226
<v Joshua Gay:>code, but other people were working on

497
00:23:12.727 --> 00:23:13.990
<v Joshua Gay:>alternatives at the time.

498
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.734
<v Joshua Gay:>And Sun was considering making theirs free

499
00:23:15.774 --> 00:23:17.041
<v Joshua Gay:>software at the time, I believe.

500
00:23:18.424 --> 00:23:20.068
<v Joshua Gay:>And so there was a lot of

501
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:22.493
<v Joshua Gay:>intersection with it at my job.

502
00:23:22.874 --> 00:23:26.145
<v Joshua Gay:>And then when the company collapsed, that's

503
00:23:26.185 --> 00:23:27.789
<v Joshua Gay:>where I really kind of doubled down.

504
00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:30.654
<v Joshua Gay:>And I said, how much of this,

505
00:23:32.743 --> 00:23:34.367
<v Joshua Gay:>where we have costs and where we

506
00:23:34.407 --> 00:23:37.694
<v Joshua Gay:>have duplication of efforts could be reduced

507
00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:38.797
<v Joshua Gay:>if we embraced free we embraced free

508
00:23:39.843 --> 00:23:40.284
<v Joshua Gay:>software?

509
00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:45.334
<v Joshua Gay:>And then I really started reading about

510
00:23:45.354 --> 00:23:47.236
<v Joshua Gay:>the GNU project and the writings of

511
00:23:47.277 --> 00:23:48.042
<v Joshua Gay:>Richard Stallman.

512
00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:48.072
<v Joshua Gay:>of Richard Stallman.

513
00:23:48.764 --> 00:23:51.369
<v Joshua Gay:>And I wrote, when I found out

514
00:23:51.469 --> 00:23:54.615
<v Joshua Gay:>that the investors in the company, or

515
00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:56.673
<v Joshua Gay:>at least how I recall or I

516
00:23:56.673 --> 00:23:58.907
<v Joshua Gay:>recall or remember it, the investors were

517
00:23:59.228 --> 00:24:02.034
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of pulling out and that they

518
00:24:02.134 --> 00:24:03.341
<v Joshua Gay:>only had a certain amount of money

519
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:06.606
<v Joshua Gay:>left and how it was going to

520
00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:07.027
<v Joshua Gay:>be spent.

521
00:24:07.047 --> 00:24:12.054
<v Joshua Gay:>I wrote a letter to sort of

522
00:24:12.276 --> 00:24:14.083
<v Joshua Gay:>my boss and his boss and sort

523
00:24:14.143 --> 00:24:17.290
<v Joshua Gay:>of outlining a plan that we could

524
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.934
<v Joshua Gay:>keep a small office like we had,

525
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:21.765
<v Joshua Gay:>which had low rent and everything else.

526
00:24:21.866 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Joshua Gay:>And we were making products and that

527
00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:25.719
<v Joshua Gay:>we could reduce it further if we

528
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.865
<v Joshua Gay:>chose to use free software as the

529
00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:29.187
<v Joshua Gay:>basis for more of our things.

530
00:24:31.092 --> 00:24:32.741
<v Joshua Gay:>And that we could likely be able

531
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:34.805
<v Joshua Gay:>to get even more done than what

532
00:24:34.866 --> 00:24:36.671
<v Joshua Gay:>we were getting done because we could

533
00:24:36.952 --> 00:24:38.961
<v Joshua Gay:>just build on top of these other

534
00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:42.687
<v Joshua Gay:>free software works that were out there

535
00:24:42.727 --> 00:24:43.288
<v Joshua Gay:>and available.

536
00:24:45.311 --> 00:24:48.919
<v Joshua Gay:>And one of the first pushbacks on

537
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.727
<v Joshua Gay:>this idea was that in theory that

538
00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:57.415
<v Joshua Gay:>sounded good, but how can they bring

539
00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:58.296
<v Joshua Gay:>this to the investors?

540
00:25:00.984 --> 00:25:02.988
<v Joshua Gay:>My argument seems to rely so heavily

541
00:25:03.108 --> 00:25:06.394
<v Joshua Gay:>on this website and a person's writing

542
00:25:06.595 --> 00:25:09.805
<v Joshua Gay:>and it doesn't cite academic papers or

543
00:25:09.825 --> 00:25:10.727
<v Joshua Gay:>a book even.

544
00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:13.353
<v Joshua Gay:>And that didn't look well.

545
00:25:13.894 --> 00:25:16.022
<v Joshua Gay:>It didn't look good in terms of

546
00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:20.009
<v Joshua Gay:>from their perspective as being kind of

547
00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:22.713
<v Joshua Gay:>a legitimate argument.

548
00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:26.705
<v Joshua Gay:>It just felt very much like it

549
00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:29.672
<v Joshua Gay:>was my subjective opinion and then some

550
00:25:30.113 --> 00:25:30.935
<v Joshua Gay:>website online.

551
00:25:33.121 --> 00:25:35.347
<v Joshua Gay:>And it would be good to have

552
00:25:35.387 --> 00:25:35.627
<v Joshua Gay:>more.

553
00:25:35.647 --> 00:25:36.890
<v Joshua Gay:>And I don't think that was their

554
00:25:37.031 --> 00:25:38.533
<v Joshua Gay:>only gripe with it.

555
00:25:38.554 --> 00:25:40.905
<v Joshua Gay:>I'm sure there was other aspects, but

556
00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:42.369
<v Joshua Gay:>that really stood out in my mind

557
00:25:43.552 --> 00:25:47.424
<v Joshua Gay:>as one of the sort of bits

558
00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:49.748
<v Joshua Gay:>of critique or critical feedback.

559
00:25:49.828 --> 00:25:52.133
<v Joshua Gay:>And that led me to actually write

560
00:25:52.193 --> 00:25:56.846
<v Joshua Gay:>Richard Solomon an email saying, "I think

561
00:25:56.866 --> 00:25:58.329
<v Joshua Gay:>it would be great if you had

562
00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:01.194
<v Joshua Gay:>a published book so that people like

563
00:26:01.254 --> 00:26:03.925
<v Joshua Gay:>myself and these situations could cite that

564
00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:05.309
<v Joshua Gay:>book and that it could be something

565
00:26:05.349 --> 00:26:07.439
<v Joshua Gay:>that is in libraries, that is out

566
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.367
<v Joshua Gay:>in the world." And for some people

567
00:26:10.427 --> 00:26:13.274
<v Joshua Gay:>who view that as being more legitimate

568
00:26:13.394 --> 00:26:16.385
<v Joshua Gay:>than something published just on the web,

569
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.195
<v Joshua Gay:>that this could be very helpful.

570
00:26:23.403 --> 00:26:27.268
<v Joshua Gay:>And he liked the idea and he

571
00:26:27.308 --> 00:26:31.594
<v Joshua Gay:>said, "basically, would I be willing to

572
00:26:31.635 --> 00:26:31.955
<v Joshua Gay:>do that?

573
00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:34.542
<v Joshua Gay:>Would I be willing to lead that

574
00:26:34.882 --> 00:26:38.206
<v Joshua Gay:>project of putting together a book of

575
00:26:38.247 --> 00:26:43.656
<v Joshua Gay:>his writing and speeches?" And that if

576
00:26:43.716 --> 00:26:46.525
<v Joshua Gay:>so, he'd be able to maybe help

577
00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:49.172
<v Joshua Gay:>provide me some support and guidance from

578
00:26:49.353 --> 00:26:52.824
<v Joshua Gay:>people who have had experience publishing books

579
00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:53.766
<v Joshua Gay:>in the past.

580
00:26:54.106 --> 00:26:59.616
<v Joshua Gay:>And yeah, that's what we did.

581
00:27:01.002 --> 00:27:01.643
<v Joshua Gay:>Exactly that.

582
00:27:01.723 --> 00:27:07.392
<v Joshua Gay:>We began a project within a couple

583
00:27:07.452 --> 00:27:09.175
<v Joshua Gay:>of weeks of that email exchange.

584
00:27:09.575 --> 00:27:12.823
<v Joshua Gay:>And about a year later, or I

585
00:27:14.668 --> 00:27:15.669
<v Joshua Gay:>think less than a year later, we

586
00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:20.762
<v Joshua Gay:>published Free Software, Free Society, the Selected

587
00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:22.324
<v Joshua Gay:>Essays of Richard M.

588
00:27:22.344 --> 00:27:22.685
<v Joshua Gay:>Solomon.

589
00:27:25.028 --> 00:27:28.534
<v Joshua Gay:>And that was a great way to

590
00:27:28.574 --> 00:27:31.963
<v Joshua Gay:>get into Free Software because I sent

591
00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:33.245
<v Joshua Gay:>a lot of emails to people in

592
00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:36.593
<v Joshua Gay:>the GNU Project, fact checking or filling

593
00:27:36.695 --> 00:27:40.447
<v Joshua Gay:>in footnotes or just grappling with some

594
00:27:40.468 --> 00:27:41.811
<v Joshua Gay:>of the concepts and ideas.

595
00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:45.163
<v Joshua Gay:>And I go and I give suggested

596
00:27:45.283 --> 00:27:46.606
<v Joshua Gay:>edits and I get it all wrong

597
00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:49.572
<v Joshua Gay:>because I'm misinterpreting the writing.

598
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.506
<v Joshua Gay:>And it was a pretty daunting task.

599
00:27:54.566 --> 00:27:57.673
<v Joshua Gay:>Richard Solomon himself, while being a famous

600
00:27:58.554 --> 00:28:01.627
<v Joshua Gay:>hacker and sort of the person who

601
00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:03.792
<v Joshua Gay:>helped create the Free Software Movement in

602
00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:07.564
<v Joshua Gay:>the GNU Project, is also famous for

603
00:28:09.807 --> 00:28:14.734
<v Joshua Gay:>his rigidity of language and exactness of

604
00:28:14.814 --> 00:28:16.857
<v Joshua Gay:>wording and definitions.

605
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.306
<v Joshua Gay:>And he's very good at that.

606
00:28:20.827 --> 00:28:23.432
<v Joshua Gay:>And he's a very clear writer.

607
00:28:23.892 --> 00:28:28.425
<v Joshua Gay:>So editing a person who has very

608
00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:31.011
<v Joshua Gay:>strong opinions about how you say things

609
00:28:31.071 --> 00:28:32.154
<v Joshua Gay:>and how you write them and the

610
00:28:32.194 --> 00:28:36.145
<v Joshua Gay:>words you use was itself a very

611
00:28:36.285 --> 00:28:40.492
<v Joshua Gay:>daunting task because quite often I would

612
00:28:40.512 --> 00:28:43.139
<v Joshua Gay:>put forth my suggestions or rewording and

613
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.968
<v Joshua Gay:>I would get very strong rejections, not

614
00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:50.575
<v Joshua Gay:>necessarily the best bedside manners from him.

615
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.866
<v Joshua Gay:>He wasn't always very polite about it.

616
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.513
<v Joshua Gay:>Or he would get very frustrated that

617
00:28:57.553 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Joshua Gay:>I was not understanding something.

618
00:28:59.360 --> 00:28:59.841
<v Joshua Gay:>But that's okay.

619
00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:02.405
<v Joshua Gay:>For me, I leaned on having a

620
00:29:02.565 --> 00:29:13.764
<v Joshua Gay:>background in having been a waiter and

621
00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:17.792
<v Joshua Gay:>a bartender and sort of customer service

622
00:29:18.032 --> 00:29:22.064
<v Joshua Gay:>and how to deal with unruly clients.

623
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.308
<v Joshua Gay:>I just sort of leaned into that

624
00:29:23.348 --> 00:29:23.870
<v Joshua Gay:>a bit more.

625
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.244
<v Joshua Gay:>I just put out a a particular

626
00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:28.888
<v Joshua Gay:>way in which I would start doing

627
00:29:28.928 --> 00:29:29.549
<v Joshua Gay:>exchanges.

628
00:29:30.632 --> 00:29:32.015
<v Joshua Gay:>That worked out quite well.

629
00:29:32.055 --> 00:29:34.263
<v Joshua Gay:>I learned a lot about engaging with

630
00:29:34.904 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Joshua Gay:>strong personalities of the Free Software community

631
00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:42.163
<v Joshua Gay:>within my first year of getting involved

632
00:29:42.223 --> 00:29:43.106
<v Joshua Gay:>into Free Software.

633
00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:44.952
<v Karen Herman:>When did you learn about the topic

634
00:29:44.992 --> 00:29:46.341
<v Karen Herman:>and about the philosophy?

635
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:48.706
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, that was at that job that

636
00:29:48.728 --> 00:29:50.331
<v Joshua Gay:>I was working, the startup.

637
00:29:50.772 --> 00:29:56.771
<v Joshua Gay:>I just started reading about it from

638
00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:08.146
<v Joshua Gay:>the GNU.org website and also seeing it

639
00:30:08.347 --> 00:30:10.931
<v Joshua Gay:>in practice of being able to run

640
00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:12.616
<v Joshua Gay:>software where I could get the source

641
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.144
<v Joshua Gay:>code and I could look at it.

642
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:16.269
<v Joshua Gay:>It being a time where I was

643
00:30:17.271 --> 00:30:20.322
<v Joshua Gay:>learning, everything was new, that was super

644
00:30:20.384 --> 00:30:20.825
<v Joshua Gay:>exciting.

645
00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:21.987
<v Joshua Gay:>I got to see how other people

646
00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:22.589
<v Joshua Gay:>wrote code.

647
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:25.455
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't get to see that very

648
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Joshua Gay:>often.

649
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.904
<v Joshua Gay:>I had textbook examples and things like

650
00:30:27.944 --> 00:30:31.130
<v Joshua Gay:>that, but not good full large application

651
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.385
<v Joshua Gay:>development or system software development.

652
00:30:37.547 --> 00:30:40.394
<v Joshua Gay:>That was really incredible being able to

653
00:30:40.434 --> 00:30:40.775
<v Joshua Gay:>do that.

654
00:30:41.461 --> 00:30:44.127
<v Joshua Gay:>And it wasn't just the GNU project

655
00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:45.269
<v Joshua Gay:>things.

656
00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:47.815
<v Joshua Gay:>I remember one of the first bits

657
00:30:47.855 --> 00:30:49.604
<v Joshua Gay:>of source code I also had read

658
00:30:49.644 --> 00:30:52.171
<v Joshua Gay:>early on was, I think it was

659
00:30:52.191 --> 00:30:56.787
<v Joshua Gay:>the source code to LiveJournal, a website

660
00:30:56.807 --> 00:30:58.031
<v Joshua Gay:>that used to exist for people to

661
00:30:58.492 --> 00:30:59.234
<v Joshua Gay:>blog in journal.

662
00:30:59.234 --> 00:31:02.386
<v Joshua Gay:>And And one of the novel things

663
00:31:03.268 --> 00:31:05.352
<v Joshua Gay:>that it had was infinitely nested comments.

664
00:31:05.372 --> 00:31:08.719
<v Joshua Gay:>I think it was pretty early on

665
00:31:08.719 --> 00:31:08.789
<v Joshua Gay:>that I maybe it was pretty early

666
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:09.888
<v Joshua Gay:>on that I maybe read the code

667
00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:11.331
<v Joshua Gay:>for how that worked and things like

668
00:31:11.352 --> 00:31:11.493
<v Joshua Gay:>that.

669
00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:13.317
<v Joshua Gay:>And it was cool to just see

670
00:31:13.317 --> 00:31:26.510
<v Joshua Gay:>code, like look at code that was

671
00:31:27.532 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Joshua Gay:>doing something new that I appreciated on

672
00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:32.703
<v Joshua Gay:>the internet.

673
00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:38.571
<v Joshua Gay:>That really got me excited.

674
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:41.195
<v Joshua Gay:>I think that I was young and

675
00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:47.049
<v Joshua Gay:>idealistic and I wasn't necessarily concerned with

676
00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:50.796
<v Joshua Gay:>the practicalities of how businesses work or

677
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.661
<v Joshua Gay:>making a living.

678
00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:54.890
<v Joshua Gay:>It was all just feeling like this

679
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.534
<v Joshua Gay:>is amazing, this is how it should

680
00:31:56.574 --> 00:31:56.715
<v Joshua Gay:>be.

681
00:31:58.944 --> 00:32:01.268
<v Joshua Gay:>That really helped being in that mindset

682
00:32:01.308 --> 00:32:04.754
<v Joshua Gay:>and being in that learning and absorbent

683
00:32:05.035 --> 00:32:05.516
<v Joshua Gay:>mindset.

684
00:32:05.516 --> 00:32:10.591
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was hooked pretty quickly that

685
00:32:10.772 --> 00:32:12.315
<v Joshua Gay:>this seemed like a really good thing.

686
00:32:13.483 --> 00:32:14.647
<v Karen Herman:>And what did the book do for

687
00:32:14.687 --> 00:32:14.766
<v Karen Herman:>you?

688
00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:16.894
<v Karen Herman:>Did that lead anywhere for you?

689
00:32:20.383 --> 00:32:23.947
<v Joshua Gay:>It definitely made me start to think

690
00:32:24.168 --> 00:32:25.770
<v Joshua Gay:>about how else it could apply.

691
00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:30.419
<v Joshua Gay:>So one thing that we did with

692
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.806
<v Joshua Gay:>the book is we decided that we

693
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.350
<v Joshua Gay:>should go get somebody to do an

694
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.523
<v Joshua Gay:>introduction that maybe wasn't squarely related to

695
00:32:38.543 --> 00:32:40.986
<v Joshua Gay:>the GNU Project or open source.

696
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.596
<v Joshua Gay:>I emailed, cold emailed Lawrence Lessig.

697
00:32:47.441 --> 00:32:49.927
<v Joshua Gay:>At the time he was a professor

698
00:32:50.187 --> 00:32:52.412
<v Joshua Gay:>at Stanford, I believe.

699
00:32:52.813 --> 00:32:56.726
<v Joshua Gay:>He was just starting Creative Commons.

700
00:32:56.906 --> 00:32:59.071
<v Joshua Gay:>I believe his book, Code, may have

701
00:32:59.091 --> 00:33:00.353
<v Joshua Gay:>been released the year before.

702
00:33:00.373 --> 00:33:08.469
<v Joshua Gay:>He had just done a major case

703
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:12.654
<v Joshua Gay:>that went before the Supreme Court that

704
00:33:12.694 --> 00:33:17.903
<v Joshua Gay:>related to the Copyright Extension Act, Congress

705
00:33:17.964 --> 00:33:21.227
<v Joshua Gay:>extending the length of copyright retroactively.

706
00:33:26.675 --> 00:33:29.021
<v Joshua Gay:>Maybe it was Eldred versus Ashcroft, if

707
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:32.567
<v Joshua Gay:>I recall, was the case.

708
00:33:32.727 --> 00:33:37.015
<v Joshua Gay:>Eldred was his client and he went

709
00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:38.601
<v Joshua Gay:>to the Supreme Court and argued before

710
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:39.924
<v Joshua Gay:>it and unfortunately lost.

711
00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:50.344
<v Joshua Gay:>But he's this really charismatic, impassioned professor

712
00:33:50.465 --> 00:33:59.175
<v Joshua Gay:>saying, "let's take these principles of free

713
00:33:59.195 --> 00:34:01.542
<v Joshua Gay:>software and apply them to the creative

714
00:34:01.562 --> 00:34:04.689
<v Joshua Gay:>world and other works of creative expression

715
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.821
<v Joshua Gay:>and creating the Creative Commons and licensing

716
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:11.366
<v Joshua Gay:>suite." That idea that a person that's

717
00:34:11.427 --> 00:34:13.471
<v Joshua Gay:>doing that should be the introduction to

718
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.949
<v Joshua Gay:>Richard Solomon's work philosophically really helped me

719
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.321
<v Joshua Gay:>understand that free software is a concept

720
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.087
<v Joshua Gay:>you can apply or open source as

721
00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:29.431
<v Joshua Gay:>people know it.

722
00:34:30.533 --> 00:34:31.634
<v Joshua Gay:>That's exactly what we've seen.

723
00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:34.125
<v Joshua Gay:>We've seen now people say open source

724
00:34:34.304 --> 00:34:37.411
<v Joshua Gay:>and then they'll say open hardware, open

725
00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:39.922
<v Joshua Gay:>science, open data, open education and all

726
00:34:39.943 --> 00:34:40.705
<v Joshua Gay:>of these other things.

727
00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:43.712
<v Joshua Gay:>But at the time open source itself,

728
00:34:43.813 --> 00:34:49.826
<v Joshua Gay:>the term was 18 months old and

729
00:34:50.246 --> 00:34:51.968
<v Joshua Gay:>free software had been the word.

730
00:34:52.009 --> 00:34:58.457
<v Joshua Gay:>But there wasn't a lot of people

731
00:34:58.497 --> 00:35:01.547
<v Joshua Gay:>saying, let's apply what they're doing in

732
00:35:01.587 --> 00:35:03.191
<v Joshua Gay:>the free and open source software world

733
00:35:03.272 --> 00:35:04.455
<v Joshua Gay:>to these other things.

734
00:35:09.883 --> 00:35:10.223
<v Joshua Gay:>There were.

735
00:35:10.243 --> 00:35:12.086
<v Joshua Gay:>I wasn't at all unique.

736
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:17.875
<v Joshua Gay:>Wikipedia and other things were getting off

737
00:35:17.896 --> 00:35:19.241
<v Joshua Gay:>the ground at that time.

738
00:35:21.484 --> 00:35:23.107
<v Joshua Gay:>But even those, the world was very

739
00:35:23.147 --> 00:35:23.487
<v Joshua Gay:>small.

740
00:35:23.507 --> 00:35:32.924
<v Joshua Gay:>When Wikipedia started, the way that the

741
00:35:32.945 --> 00:35:35.731
<v Joshua Gay:>GNU project tried to influence them was

742
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.741
<v Joshua Gay:>by competing and launching a GNUpedia project

743
00:35:39.802 --> 00:35:42.428
<v Joshua Gay:>which licensed things under a free documentation

744
00:35:42.488 --> 00:35:44.111
<v Joshua Gay:>license.

745
00:35:44.171 --> 00:35:47.762
<v Joshua Gay:>When Wikipedia made some evolutionary changes, it

746
00:35:47.802 --> 00:35:51.189
<v Joshua Gay:>decided to adopt that GNUpedia approach and

747
00:35:52.331 --> 00:35:55.582
<v Joshua Gay:>take those licensed work and then GNUpedia

748
00:35:55.602 --> 00:35:56.525
<v Joshua Gay:>said, well, I'm done.

749
00:35:57.166 --> 00:35:58.651
<v Joshua Gay:>That was all we wanted to accomplish.

750
00:35:59.272 --> 00:36:03.346
<v Joshua Gay:>They finished their work because Wikipedia decided

751
00:36:03.387 --> 00:36:06.835
<v Joshua Gay:>to adopt this free documentation license.

752
00:36:12.246 --> 00:36:16.672
<v Joshua Gay:>As those things were happening and I

753
00:36:16.712 --> 00:36:20.136
<v Joshua Gay:>was getting really excited about looking at

754
00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:24.269
<v Joshua Gay:>things like textbooks and free educational works,

755
00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:25.231
<v Joshua Gay:>what could we do there?

756
00:36:25.752 --> 00:36:26.955
<v Joshua Gay:>They're functional in nature.

757
00:36:27.802 --> 00:36:30.148
<v Joshua Gay:>Collaboration would greatly benefit them.

758
00:36:30.248 --> 00:36:32.754
<v Joshua Gay:>Licensing, you can almost think of them

759
00:36:32.834 --> 00:36:35.183
<v Joshua Gay:>as modular like software is and you

760
00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:36.165
<v Joshua Gay:>can piece them together.

761
00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:41.174
<v Joshua Gay:>I really started to put a lot

762
00:36:41.195 --> 00:36:44.964
<v Joshua Gay:>of energy into that area of work

763
00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:52.115
<v Joshua Gay:>really early on and always looking for

764
00:36:52.675 --> 00:36:53.637
<v Joshua Gay:>what are other people doing?

765
00:36:54.723 --> 00:36:55.806
<v Joshua Gay:>Are they doing the same thing in

766
00:36:55.887 --> 00:36:57.852
<v Joshua Gay:>open science and open data and things

767
00:36:57.872 --> 00:36:58.234
<v Joshua Gay:>like that?

768
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:01.645
<v Joshua Gay:>And how is this philosophy being applied?

769
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:07.535
<v Joshua Gay:>That mindset from day one and not

770
00:37:07.595 --> 00:37:10.524
<v Joshua Gay:>necessarily just the let's build the operating

771
00:37:10.564 --> 00:37:13.509
<v Joshua Gay:>system or I'm going to make a

772
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.221
<v Joshua Gay:>career continuing to do software development.

773
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:19.928
<v Joshua Gay:>I almost abandoned that at that point.

774
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.335
<v Joshua Gay:>I still had a desire to learn

775
00:37:23.435 --> 00:37:27.526
<v Joshua Gay:>more in kind of a research academic

776
00:37:27.566 --> 00:37:27.966
<v Joshua Gay:>setting.

777
00:37:28.367 --> 00:37:33.075
<v Joshua Gay:>I continued on with my school career,

778
00:37:33.576 --> 00:37:35.984
<v Joshua Gay:>but at the same time, I put

779
00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:38.331
<v Joshua Gay:>in just as much time into these

780
00:37:38.511 --> 00:37:43.164
<v Joshua Gay:>other passions as I was finishing my

781
00:37:43.204 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Joshua Gay:>college degree.

782
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.933
<v Karen Herman:>When you graduated, was that where you

783
00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Karen Herman:>got into the open education piece?

784
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:52.843
<v Karen Herman:>Where did you go from?

785
00:37:53.786 --> 00:37:55.450
<v Joshua Gay:>When I was at UMass Amherst, which

786
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.921
<v Joshua Gay:>is where I transferred after Suffolk University,

787
00:37:57.941 --> 00:38:02.585
<v Joshua Gay:>I guess that would be the fall

788
00:38:02.585 --> 00:38:02.686
<v Joshua Gay:>of 2001.

789
00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:14.440
<v Joshua Gay:>That's when I think the book Free

790
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.046
<v Joshua Gay:>Software, Free Society came out and I

791
00:38:18.086 --> 00:38:21.792
<v Joshua Gay:>was working in the hand-eye limb lab

792
00:38:21.812 --> 00:38:28.923
<v Joshua Gay:>at the robotics lab at the University

793
00:38:28.943 --> 00:38:31.726
<v Joshua Gay:>of Massachusetts Amherst.

794
00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:37.092
<v Joshua Gay:>I think having something so physical and

795
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.023
<v Joshua Gay:>real made me think, how do I

796
00:38:44.043 --> 00:38:44.502
<v Joshua Gay:>build on this?

797
00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:46.866
<v Joshua Gay:>Even if I wasn't immersed with people

798
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:56.607
<v Joshua Gay:>that were also doing that, it got

799
00:38:56.647 --> 00:38:58.951
<v Joshua Gay:>me excited that I could finish something

800
00:38:59.392 --> 00:39:01.696
<v Joshua Gay:>substantial with people in a year.

801
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.984
<v Joshua Gay:>So I started looking for other kinds

802
00:39:04.024 --> 00:39:05.767
<v Joshua Gay:>of projects.

803
00:39:06.649 --> 00:39:09.553
<v Joshua Gay:>I started a concept project that year

804
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:15.666
<v Joshua Gay:>called the Free Textbook Project.

805
00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:21.874
<v Joshua Gay:>It had a vision statement, a goal,

806
00:39:22.975 --> 00:39:24.596
<v Joshua Gay:>trying to drum up support, get people

807
00:39:24.617 --> 00:39:26.143
<v Joshua Gay:>to buy into the idea, see if

808
00:39:26.183 --> 00:39:28.567
<v Joshua Gay:>people might be interested in making it

809
00:39:28.608 --> 00:39:28.968
<v Joshua Gay:>happen.

810
00:39:28.988 --> 00:39:30.832
<v Karen Herman:>What exactly was it?

811
00:39:30.852 --> 00:39:33.823
<v Karen Herman:>Can you give a long line description?

812
00:39:33.843 --> 00:39:34.705
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, absolutely.

813
00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:38.232
<v Joshua Gay:>Basically, the vision was to create an

814
00:39:38.252 --> 00:39:42.826
<v Joshua Gay:>initiative to create the tools and the

815
00:39:42.886 --> 00:39:47.055
<v Joshua Gay:>content for people to be able to

816
00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:53.808
<v Joshua Gay:>put out free and open source licensed

817
00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:56.412
<v Joshua Gay:>textbooks, K-12 and college, with the idea

818
00:39:56.432 --> 00:40:04.567
<v Joshua Gay:>that especially for STEM type topics, let's

819
00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:08.393
<v Joshua Gay:>also build a library of example problem

820
00:40:08.433 --> 00:40:12.022
<v Joshua Gay:>sets and concepts and make it easier

821
00:40:12.903 --> 00:40:15.027
<v Joshua Gay:>at a very modular level to be

822
00:40:15.047 --> 00:40:18.512
<v Joshua Gay:>able to form units and to craft

823
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:24.066
<v Joshua Gay:>text and use as other teaching materials.

824
00:40:24.106 --> 00:40:26.931
<v Joshua Gay:>If you want to produce your lectures,

825
00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.354
<v Joshua Gay:>if you want to actually have full

826
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.125
<v Joshua Gay:>books, all being from the same base

827
00:40:33.447 --> 00:40:38.296
<v Joshua Gay:>that we collaborate on and structured in

828
00:40:38.316 --> 00:40:40.384
<v Joshua Gay:>that way, where you have this base

829
00:40:40.484 --> 00:40:42.870
<v Joshua Gay:>level almost operating system that you then

830
00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:44.574
<v Joshua Gay:>have initiatives on top of.

831
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.307
<v Joshua Gay:>Let's have the specific biology book.

832
00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:51.592
<v Joshua Gay:>Yes, we might have to focus on

833
00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:54.961
<v Joshua Gay:>that, but we feed down into that

834
00:40:55.582 --> 00:40:59.747
<v Joshua Gay:>base level source material.

835
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:03.752
<v Joshua Gay:>That was the pitch, the concept of

836
00:41:03.772 --> 00:41:03.812
<v Joshua Gay:>it.

837
00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:09.904
<v Joshua Gay:>It led to, in pitching and talking

838
00:41:09.924 --> 00:41:12.930
<v Joshua Gay:>about it, it led to other opportunities

839
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:15.961
<v Joshua Gay:>that were in the neighborhood, projects that

840
00:41:15.981 --> 00:41:17.265
<v Joshua Gay:>had already gotten off the ground.

841
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.673
<v Karen Herman:>Did this one get off the ground?

842
00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:22.023
<v Joshua Gay:>This one didn't get very far.

843
00:41:22.043 --> 00:41:28.152
<v Joshua Gay:>I felt like I would need a

844
00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:34.624
<v Joshua Gay:>substantial number of people who had experience

845
00:41:34.684 --> 00:41:38.130
<v Joshua Gay:>doing this work and creating it.

846
00:41:38.711 --> 00:41:41.255
<v Joshua Gay:>I just didn't feel like it was

847
00:41:41.295 --> 00:41:44.564
<v Joshua Gay:>something that I had the competency to

848
00:41:44.684 --> 00:41:46.046
<v Joshua Gay:>just start doing and making.

849
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Joshua Gay:>It was more a startup-type approach with

850
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.425
<v Joshua Gay:>a pitch and trying to get some

851
00:41:54.605 --> 00:41:58.252
<v Joshua Gay:>seed funding around the idea and a

852
00:41:58.313 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Joshua Gay:>small website that did exist for quite

853
00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:01.002
<v Joshua Gay:>a long time.

854
00:42:02.104 --> 00:42:06.473
<v Joshua Gay:>It didn't really make it past that,

855
00:42:06.573 --> 00:42:08.401
<v Joshua Gay:>but in going out there and pitching

856
00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:09.964
<v Joshua Gay:>the idea, I was able to find

857
00:42:10.084 --> 00:42:13.973
<v Joshua Gay:>other people doing similar projects or similar

858
00:42:14.054 --> 00:42:17.605
<v Joshua Gay:>in kind, or that might be considered

859
00:42:17.626 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Joshua Gay:>a piece of this broader vision that

860
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Joshua Gay:>I had.

861
00:42:21.533 --> 00:42:25.743
<v Joshua Gay:>There was a website, a blog that

862
00:42:25.844 --> 00:42:30.070
<v Joshua Gay:>Jason Turgeon created called Textbook Revolution.

863
00:42:31.993 --> 00:42:34.557
<v Joshua Gay:>It was just published a bunch of

864
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:41.910
<v Joshua Gay:>listings and reviews of various...

865
00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:44.534
<v Joshua Gay:>If you're a teacher and you're making

866
00:42:44.554 --> 00:42:48.464
<v Joshua Gay:>your book freely available online, here's a

867
00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.829
<v Joshua Gay:>quick little library-type entry and a link

868
00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:50.949
<v Joshua Gay:>to it.

869
00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:55.562
<v Joshua Gay:>If need be, we would store the

870
00:42:55.843 --> 00:42:58.348
<v Joshua Gay:>file if it was above board.

871
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:00.534
<v Joshua Gay:>I took over that project and ran

872
00:43:00.594 --> 00:43:01.540
<v Joshua Gay:>it for a number of years.

873
00:43:03.304 --> 00:43:04.407
<v Joshua Gay:>For a long time, it was the

874
00:43:04.447 --> 00:43:08.455
<v Joshua Gay:>largest and biggest resource for freely available

875
00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:22.491
<v Joshua Gay:>or educational, K-12, mostly college, but some

876
00:43:23.112 --> 00:43:25.676
<v Joshua Gay:>K-12 textbooks and course readers and things

877
00:43:25.716 --> 00:43:26.100
<v Joshua Gay:>like that.

878
00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:26.982
<v Karen Herman:>What was it called?

879
00:43:28.125 --> 00:43:29.147
<v Joshua Gay:>Textbook Revolution.

880
00:43:29.548 --> 00:43:29.788
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

881
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:30.671
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

882
00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:31.412
<v Karen Herman:>All right.

883
00:43:31.432 --> 00:43:32.980
<v Karen Herman:>Why don't we stop here and take

884
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.423
<v Karen Herman:>a little break and then we'll come

885
00:43:34.443 --> 00:43:34.904
<v Karen Herman:>back.

886
00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:36.246
<v Joshua Gay:>Awesome.

887
00:43:37.108 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Joshua Gay:>Thanks.

888
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.694
<v Karen Herman:>We're back on.

889
00:43:41.075 --> 00:43:43.223
<v Karen Herman:>When we left off, what did you

890
00:43:43.264 --> 00:43:44.808
<v Karen Herman:>do after you graduated?

891
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.514
<v Karen Herman:>All these things you've done before that,

892
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.221
<v Karen Herman:>we're still also in school.

893
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:48.522
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

894
00:43:48.562 --> 00:43:50.844
<v Joshua Gay:>I met my now-wife while I was

895
00:43:50.884 --> 00:43:53.546
<v Joshua Gay:>in college and she...

896
00:44:05.362 --> 00:44:05.742
<v Joshua Gay:>Meredith.

897
00:44:06.463 --> 00:44:11.388
<v Joshua Gay:>Meredith Beaton.

898
00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:19.577
<v Joshua Gay:>Meredith was at Wellesley College in Wellesley,

899
00:44:19.617 --> 00:44:20.217
<v Joshua Gay:>Massachusetts.

900
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.541
<v Joshua Gay:>It's an all-women's college.

901
00:44:24.145 --> 00:44:27.029
<v Joshua Gay:>She got a degree in computer science

902
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.993
<v Joshua Gay:>and a minor in math.

903
00:44:30.314 --> 00:44:33.022
<v Joshua Gay:>I got a degree in math and

904
00:44:33.042 --> 00:44:35.506
<v Joshua Gay:>a minor in computer science.

905
00:44:36.228 --> 00:44:40.656
<v Joshua Gay:>We both have this passion, but coming

906
00:44:40.696 --> 00:44:42.624
<v Joshua Gay:>at it from different angles around education.

907
00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:45.629
<v Joshua Gay:>The Free Textbook Project to me was

908
00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:49.503
<v Joshua Gay:>really a way to empower learners and

909
00:44:50.405 --> 00:44:54.272
<v Joshua Gay:>especially, I think I probably projected a

910
00:44:54.312 --> 00:44:56.541
<v Joshua Gay:>lot of myself onto other learners, people

911
00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:57.504
<v Joshua Gay:>who love to be able to go

912
00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:58.829
<v Joshua Gay:>out there and learn on their own

913
00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:00.982
<v Joshua Gay:>or at their own pace or to

914
00:45:01.022 --> 00:45:03.547
<v Joshua Gay:>make it easy to adapt curriculum to

915
00:45:04.329 --> 00:45:05.211
<v Joshua Gay:>learners like myself.

916
00:45:05.652 --> 00:45:08.942
<v Joshua Gay:>I'm pretty sure I probably, at that

917
00:45:08.982 --> 00:45:12.469
<v Joshua Gay:>time, it wasn't much more sophisticated than

918
00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:12.729
<v Joshua Gay:>that.

919
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.093
<v Joshua Gay:>That was informing the design of it.

920
00:45:17.442 --> 00:45:19.366
<v Joshua Gay:>Meredith also had a passion for education.

921
00:45:20.168 --> 00:45:22.473
<v Joshua Gay:>She applied for graduate school at Columbia

922
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.503
<v Joshua Gay:>University and got accepted to the Teachers

923
00:45:25.543 --> 00:45:27.727
<v Joshua Gay:>College at Columbia.

924
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:34.342
<v Joshua Gay:>After we graduated, we moved to New

925
00:45:34.382 --> 00:45:36.967
<v Joshua Gay:>York, a little apartment on the Upper

926
00:45:37.007 --> 00:45:37.528
<v Joshua Gay:>West Side.

927
00:45:40.213 --> 00:45:41.255
<v Joshua Gay:>I didn't have a job.

928
00:45:41.395 --> 00:45:45.245
<v Joshua Gay:>I started the applying for two kinds

929
00:45:45.285 --> 00:45:45.725
<v Joshua Gay:>of jobs.

930
00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:50.694
<v Joshua Gay:>One was leaning on my background in

931
00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:52.156
<v Joshua Gay:>editing.

932
00:45:55.484 --> 00:45:58.610
<v Joshua Gay:>After I published Free Software, Free Society

933
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.834
<v Joshua Gay:>and I got a lot of experience

934
00:46:00.914 --> 00:46:06.247
<v Joshua Gay:>in publishing, one of the gigs I

935
00:46:06.287 --> 00:46:07.910
<v Joshua Gay:>had in addition to some other jobs

936
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.616
<v Joshua Gay:>in college was being a copy editor.

937
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:16.746
<v Joshua Gay:>I was able to put out, copy

938
00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:22.172
<v Joshua Gay:>edit four or five large volumes of

939
00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:22.752
<v Joshua Gay:>work for them.

940
00:46:24.195 --> 00:46:30.345
<v Joshua Gay:>Nothing too exciting, but I got trained

941
00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:36.292
<v Joshua Gay:>by Ann Costante, who in the math

942
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:39.841
<v Joshua Gay:>publishing world was somewhat famous and really

943
00:46:39.882 --> 00:46:40.383
<v Joshua Gay:>amazing.

944
00:46:40.423 --> 00:46:42.447
<v Joshua Gay:>It was a really great thing.

945
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.313
<v Joshua Gay:>I learned so much and gained so

946
00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:48.082
<v Joshua Gay:>many skills that it seemed silly to

947
00:46:48.122 --> 00:46:51.147
<v Joshua Gay:>not apply those after college.

948
00:46:51.287 --> 00:46:53.571
<v Joshua Gay:>I applied to small publishing houses.

949
00:46:53.591 --> 00:46:59.404
<v Joshua Gay:>I really did want to learn how

950
00:46:59.444 --> 00:47:01.247
<v Joshua Gay:>could I do this free textbook project

951
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:04.014
<v Joshua Gay:>by myself if I can't get funding

952
00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:05.122
<v Joshua Gay:>and hire people to do it.

953
00:47:06.045 --> 00:47:08.350
<v Joshua Gay:>I also applied for software development jobs.

954
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:09.439
<v Joshua Gay:>The first one I got was at

955
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.087
<v Joshua Gay:>at a small publisher that focused on

956
00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:19.416
<v Joshua Gay:>writing texts and supplementary works to textbooks

957
00:47:19.556 --> 00:47:21.403
<v Joshua Gay:>and some textbooks, but that was a

958
00:47:21.423 --> 00:47:23.267
<v Joshua Gay:>hard thing to gain entrance into.

959
00:47:23.287 --> 00:47:28.561
<v Joshua Gay:>It was run by an owner, an

960
00:47:29.082 --> 00:47:33.447
<v Joshua Gay:>operator, wear every hat and hire contractors

961
00:47:33.507 --> 00:47:34.749
<v Joshua Gay:>and others as he can.

962
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:41.721
<v Joshua Gay:>One of the things that really made

963
00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:44.406
<v Joshua Gay:>me want to work for him is

964
00:47:44.527 --> 00:47:47.713
<v Joshua Gay:>I pitched for him the idea behind

965
00:47:47.753 --> 00:47:49.299
<v Joshua Gay:>the free textbook project in in my

966
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:49.702
<v Joshua Gay:>interview.

967
00:47:50.343 --> 00:47:51.987
<v Joshua Gay:>He said, "I'm looking to get out

968
00:47:52.008 --> 00:47:52.589
<v Joshua Gay:>of this.

969
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:54.715
<v Joshua Gay:>If this works out, maybe you could

970
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:56.962
<v Joshua Gay:>take over this company and you could

971
00:47:56.983 --> 00:48:04.194
<v Joshua Gay:>convert it." Although the odds of that

972
00:48:04.234 --> 00:48:06.120
<v Joshua Gay:>happening were very low, it was enough

973
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:08.125
<v Joshua Gay:>to get me to accept the job

974
00:48:09.488 --> 00:48:12.335
<v Joshua Gay:>offer for not much pay on the

975
00:48:12.375 --> 00:48:12.635
<v Joshua Gay:>spot.

976
00:48:16.283 --> 00:48:17.425
<v Joshua Gay:>That's what I started out doing.

977
00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:19.769
<v Joshua Gay:>That didn't last but a few months.

978
00:48:20.971 --> 00:48:23.055
<v Joshua Gay:>Pay was challenging.

979
00:48:23.095 --> 00:48:26.767
<v Joshua Gay:>The work was really demanding, really fast-paced.

980
00:48:26.787 --> 00:48:29.273
<v Joshua Gay:>I tried to turn over tests and

981
00:48:29.313 --> 00:48:33.268
<v Joshua Gay:>other things that basically textbook companies needed

982
00:48:33.328 --> 00:48:34.812
<v Joshua Gay:>done on short order.

983
00:48:35.052 --> 00:48:37.402
<v Joshua Gay:>They would go to him and he

984
00:48:37.442 --> 00:48:40.187
<v Joshua Gay:>would go to me and say, a

985
00:48:40.207 --> 00:48:41.609
<v Joshua Gay:>hundred problems or something.

986
00:48:41.629 --> 00:48:45.676
<v Joshua Gay:>I couldn't keep up that kind of

987
00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:48.627
<v Joshua Gay:>pace and it didn't work out, but

988
00:48:48.647 --> 00:48:50.112
<v Joshua Gay:>I learned a ton in that short

989
00:48:50.152 --> 00:48:50.734
<v Joshua Gay:>period of time.

990
00:48:51.602 --> 00:48:52.763
<v Joshua Gay:>Then I went on and I got

991
00:48:52.845 --> 00:48:57.254
<v Joshua Gay:>a programming job for Harris Corporations briefly.

992
00:49:00.924 --> 00:49:04.551
<v Joshua Gay:>I tried to convert them to Freed

993
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:06.033
<v Joshua Gay:>Open Source Software while I was there

994
00:49:06.054 --> 00:49:08.545
<v Joshua Gay:>in my brief time for a few

995
00:49:08.565 --> 00:49:08.845
<v Joshua Gay:>months.

996
00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:11.192
<v Joshua Gay:>And then my wife...

997
00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:11.834
<v Karen Herman:>Any ill-luck?

998
00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:14.926
<v Joshua Gay:>No, No, not really.

999
00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:17.451
<v Joshua Gay:>I persuaded one director in the company.

1000
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:20.176
<v Joshua Gay:>They had an old system.

1001
00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:31.768
<v Joshua Gay:>It was a trading system for people

1002
00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:36.116
<v Joshua Gay:>buying airtime for commercials, national and local

1003
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.160
<v Joshua Gay:>TV commercials.

1004
00:49:38.083 --> 00:49:40.827
<v Joshua Gay:>You have this whole real-time bidding of

1005
00:49:41.508 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Joshua Gay:>the agents who are buying commercial slots

1006
00:49:47.402 --> 00:49:50.227
<v Joshua Gay:>or trying to for their clients and

1007
00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:52.731
<v Joshua Gay:>whoever has a commercial to sell and

1008
00:49:55.015 --> 00:49:55.936
<v Joshua Gay:>the network televisions.

1009
00:49:58.084 --> 00:49:59.828
<v Joshua Gay:>It was a pretty cool system because

1010
00:49:59.848 --> 00:50:01.953
<v Joshua Gay:>in New York, where all of those

1011
00:50:02.013 --> 00:50:07.769
<v Joshua Gay:>people were, they had had this system

1012
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:10.234
<v Joshua Gay:>running continuously since the 80s with almost

1013
00:50:10.334 --> 00:50:14.807
<v Joshua Gay:>no downtime because basically buying slots for

1014
00:50:14.827 --> 00:50:17.994
<v Joshua Gay:>commercials is something that happens 24 hours

1015
00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:18.174
<v Joshua Gay:>a day.

1016
00:50:21.263 --> 00:50:23.668
<v Joshua Gay:>There's always adjustments on prices and things

1017
00:50:23.708 --> 00:50:24.067
<v Joshua Gay:>like that.

1018
00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:28.356
<v Joshua Gay:>I learned a ton, but because it

1019
00:50:28.396 --> 00:50:31.765
<v Joshua Gay:>was such an old system and just

1020
00:50:32.206 --> 00:50:36.954
<v Joshua Gay:>mainframe style approach, they had a very

1021
00:50:37.295 --> 00:50:39.703
<v Joshua Gay:>slow and rigorous process for updating it

1022
00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.287
<v Joshua Gay:>with new records and things.

1023
00:50:41.347 --> 00:50:44.415
<v Joshua Gay:>I wrote a system where you could

1024
00:50:45.963 --> 00:50:49.451
<v Joshua Gay:>fill in templates with the record information

1025
00:50:49.471 --> 00:50:50.011
<v Joshua Gay:>you wanted.

1026
00:50:50.032 --> 00:50:51.515
<v Joshua Gay:>Then a Python script that would spit

1027
00:50:51.635 --> 00:50:56.386
<v Joshua Gay:>out all the C code that was

1028
00:50:57.547 --> 00:51:03.475
<v Joshua Gay:>meticulous that used a lot of old

1029
00:51:03.795 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Joshua Gay:>data structures and things like that that

1030
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.524
<v Joshua Gay:>weren't really used anymore.

1031
00:51:07.544 --> 00:51:12.634
<v Joshua Gay:>It was carefully putting all the information

1032
00:51:12.654 --> 00:51:14.741
<v Joshua Gay:>into as little memory as possible because

1033
00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:16.644
<v Joshua Gay:>back in the 80s, that was really

1034
00:51:16.684 --> 00:51:16.984
<v Joshua Gay:>important.

1035
00:51:17.085 --> 00:51:19.468
<v Joshua Gay:>At that point in 2003 or whatever

1036
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.085
<v Joshua Gay:>it was, it wasn't nearly as important.

1037
00:51:28.987 --> 00:51:31.612
<v Joshua Gay:>It was a lot of work to

1038
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:32.894
<v Joshua Gay:>keep the system going.

1039
00:51:33.615 --> 00:51:37.328
<v Joshua Gay:>Some people were really excited by taking

1040
00:51:37.388 --> 00:51:38.811
<v Joshua Gay:>these tools and I wanted to release

1041
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:40.900
<v Joshua Gay:>it as a general templating engine in

1042
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.446
<v Joshua Gay:>Python that could be used for this

1043
00:51:44.786 --> 00:51:45.147
<v Joshua Gay:>system.

1044
00:51:45.167 --> 00:51:47.129
<v Joshua Gay:>I got it working, but I didn't

1045
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:52.743
<v Joshua Gay:>stick around long enough to actually give

1046
00:51:52.783 --> 00:51:53.986
<v Joshua Gay:>it to the company to release it

1047
00:51:54.147 --> 00:51:55.731
<v Joshua Gay:>as an open source project.

1048
00:51:55.751 --> 00:52:00.166
<v Joshua Gay:>Then my wife managed to compress her

1049
00:52:00.226 --> 00:52:03.091
<v Joshua Gay:>two-year program into a year and decided

1050
00:52:03.694 --> 00:52:04.881
<v Joshua Gay:>she wanted to go back to computer

1051
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:05.783
<v Joshua Gay:>science.

1052
00:52:06.064 --> 00:52:07.528
<v Joshua Gay:>I was excited to go back to

1053
00:52:07.569 --> 00:52:08.250
<v Joshua Gay:>computer science.

1054
00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:09.899
<v Joshua Gay:>I missed working in a lab, which

1055
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.045
<v Joshua Gay:>I was fortunate enough to do for

1056
00:52:13.085 --> 00:52:14.688
<v Joshua Gay:>three years at UMass Amherst.

1057
00:52:14.728 --> 00:52:19.981
<v Joshua Gay:>We both applied to the University of

1058
00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:20.522
<v Joshua Gay:>Oklahoma.

1059
00:52:21.163 --> 00:52:23.167
<v Joshua Gay:>I applied there because my advisor from

1060
00:52:23.247 --> 00:52:28.279
<v Joshua Gay:>UMass had just gotten a professorship there.

1061
00:52:29.584 --> 00:52:31.388
<v Joshua Gay:>She was motivated to apply there because

1062
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.372
<v Joshua Gay:>she's from Oklahoma.

1063
00:52:32.472 --> 00:52:33.525
<v Joshua Gay:>She wanted to be able to spend

1064
00:52:33.525 --> 00:52:33.595
<v Joshua Gay:>a little be able to spend a

1065
00:52:33.595 --> 00:52:34.585
<v Joshua Gay:>little bit more time with family.

1066
00:52:34.605 --> 00:52:36.790
<v Joshua Gay:>It's a program that we could potentially

1067
00:52:36.832 --> 00:52:37.433
<v Joshua Gay:>both get into.

1068
00:52:38.201 --> 00:52:38.461
<v Joshua Gay:>We did.

1069
00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:44.029
<v Joshua Gay:>I got in provisionally if I could

1070
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:44.832
<v Joshua Gay:>pass some courses.

1071
00:52:45.473 --> 00:52:47.516
<v Joshua Gay:>She got in directly into the PhD

1072
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.002
<v Joshua Gay:>program in computer science there.

1073
00:52:51.987 --> 00:52:53.970
<v Joshua Gay:>That's where we went next.

1074
00:52:55.633 --> 00:52:57.356
<v Joshua Gay:>It was there where I really started

1075
00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:00.205
<v Joshua Gay:>to get back to doing more with

1076
00:53:01.087 --> 00:53:03.511
<v Joshua Gay:>free and open source software in general.

1077
00:53:04.313 --> 00:53:11.791
<v Joshua Gay:>I started you know in addition to

1078
00:53:12.131 --> 00:53:17.723
<v Joshua Gay:>working in this wonderful symbiotic machine learning

1079
00:53:17.763 --> 00:53:25.695
<v Joshua Gay:>lab doing computational neuroscience work, I was

1080
00:53:25.715 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of moonlighting starting a Oklahoma non-profit

1081
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:32.935
<v Joshua Gay:>called the Commons Development Foundation.

1082
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:36.948
<v Joshua Gay:>And there I was exploring this idea

1083
00:53:37.048 --> 00:53:38.692
<v Joshua Gay:>of how do we take these ideas

1084
00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:45.948
<v Joshua Gay:>of free software and apply them either

1085
00:53:46.008 --> 00:53:48.672
<v Joshua Gay:>to new areas in a sense or

1086
00:53:49.212 --> 00:53:51.115
<v Joshua Gay:>even how do we take some of

1087
00:53:51.135 --> 00:53:54.364
<v Joshua Gay:>the best ideas of what was emerging

1088
00:53:54.384 --> 00:53:56.950
<v Joshua Gay:>at the time as sort of community,

1089
00:53:58.172 --> 00:53:59.654
<v Joshua Gay:>what some might describe as sort of

1090
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.269
<v Joshua Gay:>the open source philosophy, the development of

1091
00:54:04.569 --> 00:54:08.417
<v Joshua Gay:>it, this collaborative collective action type work.

1092
00:54:08.417 --> 00:54:10.287
<v Joshua Gay:>How do we apply that back to

1093
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.734
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of the older free software movement

1094
00:54:12.774 --> 00:54:13.893
<v Joshua Gay:>which didn't always necessarily which didn't always

1095
00:54:13.893 --> 00:54:14.304
<v Joshua Gay:>necessarily apply that.

1096
00:54:14.364 --> 00:54:16.629
<v Joshua Gay:>It had moral principles and ethics but

1097
00:54:17.232 --> 00:54:19.622
<v Joshua Gay:>the collaborative aspect of the distributed collaborative

1098
00:54:19.703 --> 00:54:24.172
<v Joshua Gay:>aspect of things like Wikipedia and whatnot

1099
00:54:24.493 --> 00:54:27.864
<v Joshua Gay:>weren't necessarily evenly you you know catching

1100
00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:28.064
<v Joshua Gay:>up.

1101
00:54:28.806 --> 00:54:31.292
<v Joshua Gay:>It's sort of this race of some

1102
00:54:31.452 --> 00:54:32.935
<v Joshua Gay:>doing it really well in some areas

1103
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.484
<v Joshua Gay:>and lagging behind at others at that

1104
00:54:35.524 --> 00:54:35.804
<v Joshua Gay:>time.

1105
00:54:36.525 --> 00:54:42.515
<v Joshua Gay:>And so I began working with Solona

1106
00:54:42.555 --> 00:54:47.025
<v Joshua Gay:>Bohnwald who's a she previously had been

1107
00:54:47.105 --> 00:54:51.432
<v Joshua Gay:>doing some work with EFF and ACLU

1108
00:54:51.993 --> 00:54:57.106
<v Joshua Gay:>down in Austin, Texas and she was

1109
00:54:57.207 --> 00:54:58.991
<v Joshua Gay:>really excited to start doing a government

1110
00:54:59.031 --> 00:55:01.641
<v Joshua Gay:>transparency project and built on free software

1111
00:55:03.104 --> 00:55:05.489
<v Joshua Gay:>and she formed this thing called the

1112
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:09.015
<v Joshua Gay:>League of Technical Voters which was to

1113
00:55:09.115 --> 00:55:13.468
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of launch these initiatives and I

1114
00:55:13.508 --> 00:55:15.572
<v Joshua Gay:>was exploring similar things.

1115
00:55:15.993 --> 00:55:18.421
<v Joshua Gay:>I decided to create something called MagnaWiki,

1116
00:55:20.063 --> 00:55:28.212
<v Joshua Gay:>a way to do annotations and revisioning

1117
00:55:28.612 --> 00:55:33.500
<v Joshua Gay:>of legislative texts so drafts of bills

1118
00:55:33.561 --> 00:55:35.284
<v Joshua Gay:>and things like that and so I

1119
00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:39.854
<v Joshua Gay:>was regularly calling legislative aides and things

1120
00:55:39.895 --> 00:55:41.423
<v Joshua Gay:>and getting their input and they were

1121
00:55:41.443 --> 00:55:44.049
<v Joshua Gay:>excited they were saying yes you want

1122
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:47.601
<v Joshua Gay:>to make tools non-profit to make our

1123
00:55:47.621 --> 00:55:51.749
<v Joshua Gay:>job easier to comment to compare and

1124
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:52.451
<v Joshua Gay:>things like that.

1125
00:55:53.653 --> 00:55:56.503
<v Joshua Gay:>They were surprisingly very receptive and willing

1126
00:55:56.564 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Joshua Gay:>to give their time and so I

1127
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.754
<v Joshua Gay:>was able to find some other like-minded

1128
00:56:00.774 --> 00:56:04.325
<v Joshua Gay:>people like Solona down in Texas and

1129
00:56:04.345 --> 00:56:06.368
<v Joshua Gay:>then similarly the Sunlight Foundation had just

1130
00:56:06.409 --> 00:56:13.989
<v Joshua Gay:>started led by Ellen Miller and funded

1131
00:56:14.009 --> 00:56:19.644
<v Joshua Gay:>by and led by Michael Klein and

1132
00:56:20.385 --> 00:56:22.127
<v Joshua Gay:>so you know I was also reaching

1133
00:56:22.168 --> 00:56:25.494
<v Joshua Gay:>out to them finding opportunities for you

1134
00:56:25.534 --> 00:56:27.803
<v Joshua Gay:>know potentially getting funding from them.

1135
00:56:27.863 --> 00:56:29.207
<v Joshua Gay:>They had me submit a full kind

1136
00:56:29.247 --> 00:56:31.721
<v Joshua Gay:>of grant proposal through the Commons Development

1137
00:56:31.761 --> 00:56:34.569
<v Joshua Gay:>Foundation on MagnaWiki and made it through

1138
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:36.374
<v Joshua Gay:>a few rounds which was pretty exciting

1139
00:56:38.804 --> 00:56:41.909
<v Joshua Gay:>and at the same time locally in

1140
00:56:41.989 --> 00:56:45.054
<v Joshua Gay:>Norman, Oklahoma I worked with the Triangle

1141
00:56:45.115 --> 00:56:48.825
<v Joshua Gay:>Fraternity, an engineering fraternity, not Delta, Triangle

1142
00:56:50.729 --> 00:56:54.195
<v Joshua Gay:>and maybe the only frat I probably

1143
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.923
<v Joshua Gay:>would ever consider joining.

1144
00:56:56.043 --> 00:57:00.071
<v Joshua Gay:>It's really wonderful frat of of engineers

1145
00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:04.763
<v Joshua Gay:>with really great attitudes and I work

1146
00:57:04.784 --> 00:57:06.147
<v Joshua Gay:>with them on doing a sort of

1147
00:57:06.167 --> 00:57:11.135
<v Joshua Gay:>a 24-hour hackathon event and it had

1148
00:57:11.175 --> 00:57:14.203
<v Joshua Gay:>a mix of things including writing code

1149
00:57:14.244 --> 00:57:18.273
<v Joshua Gay:>but also making musical instruments so it

1150
00:57:18.313 --> 00:57:19.700
<v Joshua Gay:>had this sort of Maker Faire type

1151
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.107
<v Joshua Gay:>aspect and a number of other activities

1152
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:26.134
<v Joshua Gay:>and we invited people just from the

1153
00:57:26.174 --> 00:57:27.741
<v Joshua Gay:>community as well to come and join

1154
00:57:27.761 --> 00:57:31.044
<v Joshua Gay:>and partake in addition to the student

1155
00:57:31.065 --> 00:57:31.526
<v Joshua Gay:>population.

1156
00:57:31.546 --> 00:57:39.740
<v Joshua Gay:>I started to reach out to, I

1157
00:57:40.882 --> 00:57:43.567
<v Joshua Gay:>started to put together proposals for the

1158
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:47.415
<v Joshua Gay:>free textbook initiative, that free textbook project

1159
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.765
<v Joshua Gay:>that I was still pursuing and also

1160
00:57:52.148 --> 00:57:53.891
<v Joshua Gay:>I put together a proposal to the

1161
00:57:55.654 --> 00:57:57.761
<v Joshua Gay:>Free Software Foundation to launch something called

1162
00:57:57.802 --> 00:58:00.390
<v Joshua Gay:>Libre Planet where I suggested we kind

1163
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.504
<v Joshua Gay:>of take this idea of using wikis

1164
00:58:05.927 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Joshua Gay:>and other tools as a way to

1165
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:12.301
<v Joshua Gay:>do distributed organizing around sort of issue

1166
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:14.448
<v Joshua Gay:>campaigns that mattered to the free and

1167
00:58:14.468 --> 00:58:16.401
<v Joshua Gay:>open source software world as well as

1168
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:19.107
<v Joshua Gay:>to organize both local events and sort

1169
00:58:19.127 --> 00:58:22.214
<v Joshua Gay:>of a larger conference and this was

1170
00:58:22.254 --> 00:58:22.634
<v Joshua Gay:>all great.

1171
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.622
<v Joshua Gay:>It was a lot to be doing

1172
00:58:23.682 --> 00:58:26.808
<v Joshua Gay:>on top of making next to nothing

1173
00:58:26.889 --> 00:58:29.435
<v Joshua Gay:>as a research assistant in the lab

1174
00:58:31.704 --> 00:58:33.245
<v Joshua Gay:>and by the end of the year

1175
00:58:33.266 --> 00:58:38.234
<v Joshua Gay:>I decided that I probably shouldn't stay

1176
00:58:38.275 --> 00:58:41.105
<v Joshua Gay:>enrolled and pursue a degree and my

1177
00:58:41.165 --> 00:58:44.912
<v Joshua Gay:>wife decided that going the full PhD

1178
00:58:44.952 --> 00:58:46.656
<v Joshua Gay:>route was not what she wanted.

1179
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.982
<v Joshua Gay:>She really wanted to go and use

1180
00:58:48.003 --> 00:58:50.469
<v Joshua Gay:>that education degree so she started applying

1181
00:58:50.529 --> 00:58:53.361
<v Joshua Gay:>for teaching positions.

1182
00:58:53.983 --> 00:58:55.366
<v Joshua Gay:>At the same time I started to

1183
00:58:55.386 --> 00:58:58.734
<v Joshua Gay:>look for either keeping the Commons Development

1184
00:58:58.754 --> 00:59:02.066
<v Joshua Gay:>Foundation running or taking on a role

1185
00:59:02.146 --> 00:59:02.527
<v Joshua Gay:>elsewhere.

1186
00:59:02.547 --> 00:59:06.555
<v Joshua Gay:>I ended up meeting with the Sunlight

1187
00:59:06.575 --> 00:59:10.247
<v Joshua Gay:>Foundation, the One Laptop per Child project

1188
00:59:10.287 --> 00:59:11.569
<v Joshua Gay:>which was just getting off the ground

1189
00:59:12.291 --> 00:59:14.922
<v Joshua Gay:>and meeting with the Free Software Foundation

1190
00:59:15.002 --> 00:59:16.906
<v Joshua Gay:>and I settled on the Free Software

1191
00:59:16.926 --> 00:59:21.075
<v Joshua Gay:>Foundation as a full-time job as one

1192
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.586
<v Joshua Gay:>of their first of two campaigns managers

1193
00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:25.530
<v Joshua Gay:>to run issue-based campaigning.

1194
00:59:26.292 --> 00:59:28.061
<v Joshua Gay:>They really was sort of building on

1195
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:30.685
<v Joshua Gay:>this contract that I had started with

1196
00:59:30.706 --> 00:59:34.314
<v Joshua Gay:>them to do Libre Planet which that

1197
00:59:34.354 --> 00:59:37.062
<v Joshua Gay:>work had already begun and was underway

1198
00:59:37.623 --> 00:59:40.388
<v Joshua Gay:>and did lead to exactly that a

1199
00:59:40.428 --> 00:59:45.940
<v Joshua Gay:>wiki that had some distributed collaboration and

1200
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:48.185
<v Joshua Gay:>conference and the annual conference happens every

1201
00:59:48.206 --> 00:59:51.374
<v Joshua Gay:>year in March now going on since

1202
00:59:51.474 --> 00:59:51.820
<v Joshua Gay:>I don't know know 2005-2006.

1203
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.728
<v Joshua Gay:>I can't remember when they did their

1204
00:59:55.748 --> 00:59:56.770
<v Joshua Gay:>first one.

1205
00:59:58.072 --> 00:59:59.656
<v Joshua Gay:>So we moved back to Boston.

1206
01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:03.087
<v Joshua Gay:>My wife helped build the middle school

1207
01:00:03.869 --> 01:00:06.475
<v Joshua Gay:>program at Cambridge Montessori School and became

1208
01:00:06.555 --> 01:00:09.625
<v Joshua Gay:>a Montessori certified teacher.

1209
01:00:10.227 --> 01:00:13.033
<v Joshua Gay:>She taught all the subjects except for

1210
01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:15.924
<v Joshua Gay:>art and wrote the curriculum and most

1211
01:00:15.964 --> 01:00:17.748
<v Joshua Gay:>of the source material, a lot of

1212
01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:19.231
<v Joshua Gay:>it from primary sources.

1213
01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:21.722
<v Joshua Gay:>So I just say that because that's

1214
01:00:21.782 --> 01:00:22.745
<v Joshua Gay:>a lot of work and so I

1215
01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.453
<v Joshua Gay:>spent many a weekend in her classroom

1216
01:00:27.603 --> 01:00:30.669
<v Joshua Gay:>for three years straight and during the

1217
01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:33.774
<v Joshua Gay:>weekday I would work at the Free

1218
01:00:33.794 --> 01:00:35.602
<v Joshua Gay:>Software Foundation and in the evenings I

1219
01:00:35.622 --> 01:00:36.685
<v Joshua Gay:>would spend a lot of my evenings

1220
01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:39.591
<v Joshua Gay:>at the One Laptop per Child project

1221
01:00:39.652 --> 01:00:42.283
<v Joshua Gay:>over in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

1222
01:00:44.067 --> 01:00:46.813
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of volunteering for them.

1223
01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:48.641
<v Karen Herman:>Talk a little bit about the Free

1224
01:00:48.661 --> 01:00:50.567
<v Karen Herman:>Software Foundation and what it was like

1225
01:00:50.607 --> 01:00:51.169
<v Karen Herman:>to work there.

1226
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.603
<v Karen Herman:>Were you reunited with the Richard Stallman

1227
01:00:54.004 --> 01:00:54.426
<v Karen Herman:>as well?

1228
01:00:55.369 --> 01:01:05.046
<v Joshua Gay:>So yeah Richard, when I was working

1229
01:01:05.086 --> 01:01:06.750
<v Joshua Gay:>on the book one summer I did

1230
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.235
<v Joshua Gay:>a two-month internship at the Free Software

1231
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:09.841
<v Joshua Gay:>Foundation.

1232
01:01:10.762 --> 01:01:14.749
<v Joshua Gay:>Bradley Kuhn was the executive director at

1233
01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:15.090
<v Joshua Gay:>the time.

1234
01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:18.836
<v Joshua Gay:>He eventually went on to work with

1235
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.946
<v Joshua Gay:>the Software Freedom Law Center when it

1236
01:01:20.987 --> 01:01:22.933
<v Joshua Gay:>first started and then launched the Software

1237
01:01:22.953 --> 01:01:25.865
<v Joshua Gay:>Freedom Conservancy, an organization he helped to

1238
01:01:25.905 --> 01:01:28.249
<v Joshua Gay:>found and is now led by Karen

1239
01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:28.589
<v Joshua Gay:>Sandler.

1240
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:33.422
<v Joshua Gay:>So my first sort of time in

1241
01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:37.891
<v Joshua Gay:>the office was when Bradley was in

1242
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:40.596
<v Joshua Gay:>charge and they were just, you know,

1243
01:01:41.683 --> 01:01:43.366
<v Joshua Gay:>at that time I don't think I

1244
01:01:43.427 --> 01:01:45.473
<v Joshua Gay:>saw Richard Stallman except maybe once or

1245
01:01:45.533 --> 01:01:45.874
<v Joshua Gay:>twice.

1246
01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:51.190
<v Joshua Gay:>It really was just operating, you know,

1247
01:01:51.331 --> 01:01:53.595
<v Joshua Gay:>executive director and below and didn't really

1248
01:01:53.615 --> 01:01:55.262
<v Joshua Gay:>have much engagement with Richard or the

1249
01:01:55.302 --> 01:01:55.923
<v Joshua Gay:>rest of the board.

1250
01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.854
<v Joshua Gay:>And then when I came back as

1251
01:02:02.074 --> 01:02:04.122
<v Joshua Gay:>an employee, as a campaigns manager, it

1252
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:05.685
<v Joshua Gay:>was similar.

1253
01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:08.331
<v Joshua Gay:>So Peter Brown became the executive director

1254
01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:09.975
<v Joshua Gay:>at that time.

1255
01:02:11.484 --> 01:02:14.290
<v Joshua Gay:>John Sullivan was the other campaigns manager.

1256
01:02:14.552 --> 01:02:16.157
<v Joshua Gay:>He went on to become eventually the

1257
01:02:16.197 --> 01:02:17.283
<v Joshua Gay:>executive director the executive director for many

1258
01:02:17.324 --> 01:02:20.591
<v Joshua Gay:>years, shortly thereafter, maybe a few years

1259
01:02:20.692 --> 01:02:23.057
<v Joshua Gay:>after I started there.

1260
01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:30.954
<v Joshua Gay:>And they had unionized, so they were

1261
01:02:30.974 --> 01:02:33.357
<v Joshua Gay:>a local under the United Auto Workers.

1262
01:02:35.406 --> 01:02:38.392
<v Joshua Gay:>And in part, you know, that union

1263
01:02:38.452 --> 01:02:41.182
<v Joshua Gay:>and that bargaining and that contract helped

1264
01:02:41.202 --> 01:02:43.408
<v Joshua Gay:>set kind of some firm boundaries, I

1265
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.554
<v Joshua Gay:>think, in part between Richard and the

1266
01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:45.874
<v Joshua Gay:>board.

1267
01:02:46.742 --> 01:02:49.187
<v Joshua Gay:>Richard, as a founder of a small,

1268
01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:52.815
<v Joshua Gay:>passionate organization for many years that, you

1269
01:02:52.855 --> 01:02:55.064
<v Joshua Gay:>know, was sort of having to keep

1270
01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:59.674
<v Joshua Gay:>it going himself largely, I think anybody

1271
01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:01.923
<v Joshua Gay:>in that situation sometimes have a hard

1272
01:03:01.943 --> 01:03:05.569
<v Joshua Gay:>time stepping back and not just injecting

1273
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.372
<v Joshua Gay:>themselves, right?

1274
01:03:07.053 --> 01:03:09.222
<v Joshua Gay:>And him, maybe more so than others,

1275
01:03:11.085 --> 01:03:14.551
<v Joshua Gay:>was at times injecting himself and coming

1276
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:18.221
<v Joshua Gay:>down and sort of, you know, directing

1277
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:21.888
<v Joshua Gay:>the staff or, you know, influencing changes.

1278
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:24.494
<v Joshua Gay:>And so they put in place that

1279
01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:28.248
<v Joshua Gay:>union, which really helped protect the roles

1280
01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:30.513
<v Joshua Gay:>and the reporting and everything.

1281
01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:33.447
<v Joshua Gay:>And so when I had arrived, that

1282
01:03:33.487 --> 01:03:34.609
<v Joshua Gay:>was already established.

1283
01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Joshua Gay:>And I would say, you know, the

1284
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.205
<v Joshua Gay:>interactions with Richard were more structured in

1285
01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:40.586
<v Joshua Gay:>general.

1286
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:48.223
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, there would be collaborations

1287
01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.589
<v Joshua Gay:>on things, maybe send text for feedback

1288
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.194
<v Joshua Gay:>to Richard, or maybe there would be

1289
01:03:52.194 --> 01:03:54.785
<v Joshua Gay:>specific be specific things that he would

1290
01:03:54.825 --> 01:03:58.250
<v Joshua Gay:>be giving his direct input on or

1291
01:03:58.552 --> 01:03:59.834
<v Joshua Gay:>would need to be the final say

1292
01:03:59.975 --> 01:04:00.055
<v Joshua Gay:>on.

1293
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.205
<v Joshua Gay:>But it didn't feel like I worked

1294
01:04:03.285 --> 01:04:03.947
<v Joshua Gay:>for him ever.

1295
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.654
<v Joshua Gay:>Peter Brown and then later John Sullivan

1296
01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:09.323
<v Joshua Gay:>did a really good job of sort

1297
01:04:09.343 --> 01:04:14.152
<v Joshua Gay:>of establishing that and enforcing that separation

1298
01:04:14.232 --> 01:04:18.205
<v Joshua Gay:>between, you know, management and everybody below

1299
01:04:18.225 --> 01:04:19.067
<v Joshua Gay:>that was in the union.

1300
01:04:19.087 --> 01:04:22.094
<v Joshua Gay:>And that really helped.

1301
01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:24.022
<v Joshua Gay:>It made it a healthier environment, I

1302
01:04:24.063 --> 01:04:26.788
<v Joshua Gay:>think, than it might have otherwise been.

1303
01:04:28.011 --> 01:04:31.963
<v Joshua Gay:>Because Richard did travel immensely at times,

1304
01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:34.549
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, giving well over 100 talks

1305
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:37.475
<v Joshua Gay:>a year around the world, which means,

1306
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.221
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, he would just sort of

1307
01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.730
<v Joshua Gay:>swoop in and, you know, try to

1308
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:41.673
<v Joshua Gay:>get a whole bunch of things done

1309
01:04:41.693 --> 01:04:42.080
<v Joshua Gay:>at once.

1310
01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:43.986
<v Joshua Gay:>And if you're a person trying to,

1311
01:04:44.587 --> 01:04:45.650
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, just have a job and

1312
01:04:46.051 --> 01:04:47.180
<v Joshua Gay:>get your things done, that can be

1313
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:50.426
<v Joshua Gay:>very disruptive and very difficult.

1314
01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.893
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, they did a really

1315
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:57.565
<v Joshua Gay:>nice job of helping to balance, you

1316
01:04:57.605 --> 01:04:59.910
<v Joshua Gay:>know, that and preventing those disruptions by

1317
01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:00.953
<v Joshua Gay:>the time I had arrived.

1318
01:05:01.354 --> 01:05:03.425
<v Joshua Gay:>I know that the people I worked

1319
01:05:03.465 --> 01:05:05.090
<v Joshua Gay:>with previously had gone through a lot

1320
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.533
<v Joshua Gay:>of that and it was very challenging.

1321
01:05:08.465 --> 01:05:09.828
<v Joshua Gay:>But it was a good time.

1322
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:12.214
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, they were really transitioning from

1323
01:05:13.742 --> 01:05:17.287
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of selling the GNU project code

1324
01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:21.173
<v Joshua Gay:>on CDs as a primary means of

1325
01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:26.585
<v Joshua Gay:>income to creating a membership based organization

1326
01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Joshua Gay:>where, you know, they're kind of surviving

1327
01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.819
<v Joshua Gay:>on an associate membership that gives, you

1328
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.563
<v Joshua Gay:>know, between $100 and $200 a year,

1329
01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:36.426
<v Joshua Gay:>small gifts.

1330
01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:41.734
<v Joshua Gay:>And for me, I really was excited

1331
01:05:41.795 --> 01:05:43.682
<v Joshua Gay:>by that because my goal was to

1332
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.767
<v Joshua Gay:>try to create a distributed kind of

1333
01:05:45.847 --> 01:05:50.701
<v Joshua Gay:>collaborative approach to supporting free software, supporting

1334
01:05:52.825 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Joshua Gay:>end user rights and things, as well

1335
01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:59.961
<v Joshua Gay:>as bringing support to free software communities

1336
01:06:00.021 --> 01:06:00.643
<v Joshua Gay:>and developers.

1337
01:06:01.605 --> 01:06:04.231
<v Joshua Gay:>And so it was a really good

1338
01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:05.674
<v Joshua Gay:>time to join that organization.

1339
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.523
<v Joshua Gay:>I felt like I was able to

1340
01:06:07.543 --> 01:06:08.686
<v Joshua Gay:>do just that.

1341
01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:10.430
<v Joshua Gay:>I was privileged to be able to

1342
01:06:11.091 --> 01:06:14.083
<v Joshua Gay:>every day interact with, you know, people

1343
01:06:14.143 --> 01:06:18.372
<v Joshua Gay:>all over the world that wanted help

1344
01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:21.823
<v Joshua Gay:>with one thing or another or making

1345
01:06:21.883 --> 01:06:24.328
<v Joshua Gay:>people aware of things that at the

1346
01:06:24.388 --> 01:06:28.375
<v Joshua Gay:>time seemed kind of very fringe topics,

1347
01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.061
<v Joshua Gay:>you know.

1348
01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:32.569
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, why are you protesting Microsoft

1349
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:33.712
<v Joshua Gay:>or these other things?

1350
01:06:33.933 --> 01:06:36.462
<v Joshua Gay:>And nowadays, if I talk about the

1351
01:06:36.503 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Joshua Gay:>same things that we were protesting, the

1352
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:42.341
<v Joshua Gay:>specific issues, it's so clear to people.

1353
01:06:42.482 --> 01:06:43.645
<v Joshua Gay:>They're like, oh, that's terrible.

1354
01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.232
<v Joshua Gay:>Of course, nobody would accept that today.

1355
01:06:49.684 --> 01:06:54.991
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, so it was very

1356
01:06:55.071 --> 01:06:57.575
<v Joshua Gay:>rewarding because there weren't a lot of

1357
01:06:57.675 --> 01:06:59.661
<v Joshua Gay:>other people in the space doing that.

1358
01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:00.283
<v Joshua Gay:>Now there is.

1359
01:07:00.303 --> 01:07:02.489
<v Joshua Gay:>Now there's a lot more people who

1360
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:04.254
<v Joshua Gay:>are out there and digital rights are

1361
01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.486
<v Joshua Gay:>just just part of, I think, all

1362
01:07:06.546 --> 01:07:08.631
<v Joshua Gay:>other things, all other consumer rights.

1363
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:09.674
<v Joshua Gay:>They're not as separate.

1364
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.165
<v Joshua Gay:>It's not like there's just Microsoft and

1365
01:07:12.266 --> 01:07:13.790
<v Joshua Gay:>Apple and that's it.

1366
01:07:14.532 --> 01:07:17.582
<v Joshua Gay:>Now it's, you know, people are very

1367
01:07:17.643 --> 01:07:21.489
<v Joshua Gay:>aware of there being a lot of

1368
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:24.975
<v Joshua Gay:>choice and that, you know, terms and

1369
01:07:25.035 --> 01:07:29.367
<v Joshua Gay:>conditions and how, you know, how you

1370
01:07:29.487 --> 01:07:32.252
<v Joshua Gay:>treat your users and your customers as

1371
01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:34.200
<v Joshua Gay:>being your community, right?

1372
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.606
<v Joshua Gay:>That has all shifted as an attitude

1373
01:07:37.308 --> 01:07:37.828
<v Joshua Gay:>in business.

1374
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:40.073
<v Joshua Gay:>And it was fun being a part

1375
01:07:40.114 --> 01:07:41.744
<v Joshua Gay:>of that at the Free Software Foundation,

1376
01:07:41.804 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Joshua Gay:>really, really sort of feeling that shift

1377
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.823
<v Joshua Gay:>happening and, you know, getting out there

1378
01:07:46.904 --> 01:07:50.112
<v Joshua Gay:>and doing work and supporting free software

1379
01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:50.594
<v Joshua Gay:>communities.

1380
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.264
<v Karen Herman:>But what do you think your biggest

1381
01:07:52.305 --> 01:07:54.192
<v Karen Herman:>contribution there was during your time there?

1382
01:07:57.524 --> 01:08:03.372
<v Joshua Gay:>I would say helping to, I would

1383
01:08:03.392 --> 01:08:05.013
<v Joshua Gay:>say the thing that I have seen

1384
01:08:05.075 --> 01:08:09.124
<v Joshua Gay:>the biggest impact on wasn't necessarily just

1385
01:08:09.224 --> 01:08:13.651
<v Joshua Gay:>creating the work, like helping to do

1386
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:16.435
<v Joshua Gay:>the work of the Free Software Foundation

1387
01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:17.581
<v Joshua Gay:>and their campaigns.

1388
01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:20.148
<v Joshua Gay:>I mean, that was an important contribution

1389
01:08:20.207 --> 01:08:23.520
<v Joshua Gay:>to help create their campaigns team and

1390
01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.309
<v Joshua Gay:>their methodologies and shift the business, in

1391
01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.514
<v Joshua Gay:>a sense, to being more of a

1392
01:08:29.594 --> 01:08:33.566
<v Joshua Gay:>consumer awareness, consumer activist org.

1393
01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:38.374
<v Joshua Gay:>I think it was more helping the

1394
01:08:38.734 --> 01:08:44.689
<v Joshua Gay:>individual developers and others who were trying

1395
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:47.493
<v Joshua Gay:>to do something and being able to

1396
01:08:47.613 --> 01:08:48.255
<v Joshua Gay:>support them.

1397
01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:50.043
<v Joshua Gay:>So one of the initiatives I was

1398
01:08:50.103 --> 01:08:52.931
<v Joshua Gay:>able to help get going was the

1399
01:08:52.951 --> 01:08:59.448
<v Joshua Gay:>Respect Your Freedom Certification Program, where sellers

1400
01:08:59.608 --> 01:09:05.277
<v Joshua Gay:>of devices, hardware could submit to the

1401
01:09:06.282 --> 01:09:08.707
<v Joshua Gay:>Respect Your Freedom Certification Program, their device,

1402
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.473
<v Joshua Gay:>and we would have a bunch of

1403
01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:13.024
<v Joshua Gay:>criteria, you know, does it let you

1404
01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:14.126
<v Joshua Gay:>install free software?

1405
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.072
<v Joshua Gay:>Does it have, does it not?

1406
01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.223
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, how does it respect these

1407
01:09:18.263 --> 01:09:21.111
<v Joshua Gay:>different sort of freedoms that relate to

1408
01:09:21.151 --> 01:09:22.114
<v Joshua Gay:>free and open source software?

1409
01:09:24.502 --> 01:09:28.269
<v Joshua Gay:>And what was exciting is that, you

1410
01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:30.955
<v Joshua Gay:>know, sometimes I would be in conversation

1411
01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:34.103
<v Joshua Gay:>with somebody who wanted a device to

1412
01:09:34.162 --> 01:09:36.327
<v Joshua Gay:>exist, right?

1413
01:09:36.727 --> 01:09:40.874
<v Joshua Gay:>And in one case, somebody wanted this

1414
01:09:40.934 --> 01:09:43.341
<v Joshua Gay:>whole secondary market of think pads and

1415
01:09:43.381 --> 01:09:46.649
<v Joshua Gay:>things to run free software and to

1416
01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:48.073
<v Joshua Gay:>be certified and to be able to

1417
01:09:48.113 --> 01:09:48.694
<v Joshua Gay:>be resold.

1418
01:09:50.322 --> 01:09:53.147
<v Joshua Gay:>So I was able to just sort

1419
01:09:53.247 --> 01:09:57.074
<v Joshua Gay:>of support ideas of, well, this is

1420
01:09:57.114 --> 01:09:57.876
<v Joshua Gay:>what that would look like.

1421
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.023
<v Joshua Gay:>You would need to sell devices.

1422
01:10:00.185 --> 01:10:03.112
<v Joshua Gay:>You should probably also consider making a

1423
01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:06.445
<v Joshua Gay:>project about doing this work in and

1424
01:10:06.485 --> 01:10:08.809
<v Joshua Gay:>of itself that can be promoted, right?

1425
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:10.655
<v Joshua Gay:>So that you can, as a company,

1426
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.648
<v Joshua Gay:>actually have other people participating in the

1427
01:10:13.688 --> 01:10:15.172
<v Joshua Gay:>thing that you don't have to do

1428
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:15.814
<v Joshua Gay:>it all yourself.

1429
01:10:17.564 --> 01:10:19.068
<v Joshua Gay:>And seeing things like that actually get

1430
01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:21.234
<v Joshua Gay:>off the ground and then form a

1431
01:10:21.274 --> 01:10:22.963
<v Joshua Gay:>company, then form a project.

1432
01:10:23.224 --> 01:10:25.510
<v Joshua Gay:>And that happened a number of times

1433
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:28.462
<v Joshua Gay:>in different spaces with routers and laptops.

1434
01:10:30.405 --> 01:10:34.192
<v Joshua Gay:>Just sort of feeling as though, even

1435
01:10:34.212 --> 01:10:38.362
<v Joshua Gay:>though, you know, our certification doesn't reach

1436
01:10:38.423 --> 01:10:43.373
<v Joshua Gay:>some wide audience, it's not even, you

1437
01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:45.742
<v Joshua Gay:>know, a true certification mark or anything

1438
01:10:45.803 --> 01:10:46.625
<v Joshua Gay:>that we created.

1439
01:10:47.428 --> 01:10:49.273
<v Joshua Gay:>Like you would have, say, Certified Organic

1440
01:10:49.293 --> 01:10:50.201
<v Joshua Gay:>where you have you have an independent

1441
01:10:50.242 --> 01:10:51.304
<v Joshua Gay:>testing lab and things.

1442
01:10:51.364 --> 01:10:54.251
<v Joshua Gay:>It was the same company issuing the

1443
01:10:54.271 --> 01:10:58.003
<v Joshua Gay:>certification was running the testing.

1444
01:10:58.023 --> 01:11:05.232
<v Joshua Gay:>It allowed for this other way of

1445
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:09.362
<v Joshua Gay:>supporting free software communities of saying, look,

1446
01:11:10.143 --> 01:11:10.845
<v Joshua Gay:>this does matter.

1447
01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:14.133
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, you having sustainable businesses that

1448
01:11:14.814 --> 01:11:16.804
<v Joshua Gay:>have these values and getting those off

1449
01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:18.249
<v Joshua Gay:>the ground and projects that could be

1450
01:11:18.309 --> 01:11:21.103
<v Joshua Gay:>sustained, that can have funding.

1451
01:11:21.564 --> 01:11:23.689
<v Joshua Gay:>That was really meaningful and valuable work.

1452
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:25.974
<v Joshua Gay:>And I felt like it not only

1453
01:11:26.034 --> 01:11:31.070
<v Joshua Gay:>helped those individual communities, but when sharing

1454
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Joshua Gay:>and meeting with other community managers and

1455
01:11:34.001 --> 01:11:35.766
<v Joshua Gay:>other people doing this kind of work,

1456
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.393
<v Joshua Gay:>it allowed me to help contribute to

1457
01:11:38.433 --> 01:11:39.422
<v Joshua Gay:>that bigger picture.

1458
01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.866
<v Joshua Gay:>How else are you doing this?

1459
01:11:40.887 --> 01:11:41.709
<v Joshua Gay:>How are you doing it in these

1460
01:11:41.789 --> 01:11:42.672
<v Joshua Gay:>other contexts?

1461
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.448
<v Joshua Gay:>And I would say that's really where

1462
01:11:47.809 --> 01:11:50.093
<v Joshua Gay:>the work I did there was amplified

1463
01:11:50.153 --> 01:11:53.044
<v Joshua Gay:>across multiple different sort of communities, both

1464
01:11:53.104 --> 01:11:55.250
<v Joshua Gay:>within the free software world through them

1465
01:11:55.671 --> 01:11:57.662
<v Joshua Gay:>and that engaging other communities outside of

1466
01:11:58.044 --> 01:11:58.585
<v Joshua Gay:>the FSF.

1467
01:11:59.247 --> 01:11:59.949
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, that's really cool.

1468
01:11:59.969 --> 01:12:00.611
<v Karen Herman:>That's really cool.

1469
01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:02.081
<v Karen Herman:>And why don't we stop here for

1470
01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:04.427
<v Karen Herman:>a couple minutes and I'm just going

1471
01:12:04.467 --> 01:12:05.771
<v Karen Herman:>to put the right thing there.

1472
01:12:06.132 --> 01:12:07.054
<v Karen Herman:>Okay, we're back on.

1473
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.945
<v Karen Herman:>And you had been at the Free

1474
01:12:08.965 --> 01:12:09.788
<v Karen Herman:>Software Foundation.

1475
01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:11.353
<v Karen Herman:>What was your next move after that?

1476
01:12:12.622 --> 01:12:16.948
<v Joshua Gay:>So because I was still kind of

1477
01:12:17.509 --> 01:12:21.015
<v Joshua Gay:>moonlighting with these other projects and still

1478
01:12:21.616 --> 01:12:23.562
<v Joshua Gay:>going out there pitching this free textbook

1479
01:12:23.582 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Joshua Gay:>project, which just had so many pieces

1480
01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:31.375
<v Joshua Gay:>to try to get off the ground

1481
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.525
<v Joshua Gay:>was really hard.

1482
01:12:34.186 --> 01:12:37.594
<v Joshua Gay:>I ended up getting connected with Neeru

1483
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.055
<v Joshua Gay:>Khosla.

1484
01:12:41.343 --> 01:12:46.750
<v Joshua Gay:>She had just started a project called

1485
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:50.637
<v Joshua Gay:>the CK12 Foundation, a new company organization.

1486
01:12:52.863 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Joshua Gay:>And her and her husband had been

1487
01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:58.713
<v Joshua Gay:>in Silicon Valley for quite a while

1488
01:12:58.793 --> 01:12:58.994
<v Joshua Gay:>then.

1489
01:12:59.014 --> 01:13:01.621
<v Joshua Gay:>She had a master's in I think

1490
01:13:02.984 --> 01:13:04.045
<v Joshua Gay:>molecular biology.

1491
01:13:04.867 --> 01:13:08.373
<v Joshua Gay:>He founded Sun Microsystems and went on

1492
01:13:08.433 --> 01:13:11.221
<v Joshua Gay:>to be a successful and is a

1493
01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:14.551
<v Joshua Gay:>successful venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins Coalfield

1494
01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.482
<v Joshua Gay:>Buyers and now the Khosla Ventures.

1495
01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Joshua Gay:>So they were doing quite well when

1496
01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:21.193
<v Joshua Gay:>they started the CK12 Foundation.

1497
01:13:22.421 --> 01:13:26.730
<v Joshua Gay:>Her kids had sort of gotten, she

1498
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.653
<v Joshua Gay:>has four children and they had grown

1499
01:13:28.734 --> 01:13:30.561
<v Joshua Gay:>up and she was ready to be

1500
01:13:30.862 --> 01:13:33.307
<v Joshua Gay:>able to put more focus into sort

1501
01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:34.629
<v Joshua Gay:>of a next endeavor in life.

1502
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:38.059
<v Joshua Gay:>And her and Merg and Pal founded

1503
01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:40.787
<v Joshua Gay:>the CK12 Foundation to create sort of

1504
01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:43.794
<v Joshua Gay:>these flex books, free and open textbook

1505
01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:48.787
<v Joshua Gay:>system where educators could go and just

1506
01:13:48.947 --> 01:13:53.855
<v Joshua Gay:>download freely licensed K through 12 textbooks

1507
01:13:55.262 --> 01:13:57.428
<v Joshua Gay:>that were of good quality and sort

1508
01:13:57.448 --> 01:13:59.194
<v Joshua Gay:>of standards aligned and things like that.

1509
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.610
<v Joshua Gay:>So right up there in here, that's

1510
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:02.050
<v Joshua Gay:>exactly.

1511
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:05.427
<v Joshua Gay:>Also this idea of modularity and remixing

1512
01:14:05.628 --> 01:14:07.773
<v Joshua Gay:>of them and being able to break

1513
01:14:07.813 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Joshua Gay:>it down all the way down to

1514
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.186
<v Joshua Gay:>building, you know, their vision was very

1515
01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Joshua Gay:>similar in terms of at the end

1516
01:14:13.673 --> 01:14:15.182
<v Joshua Gay:>of the day, ultimately having kind of

1517
01:14:15.824 --> 01:14:17.768
<v Joshua Gay:>very modular things and being able to

1518
01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:21.221
<v Joshua Gay:>make it easy for learners to customize

1519
01:14:21.262 --> 01:14:23.367
<v Joshua Gay:>to that individual learner as well as

1520
01:14:23.448 --> 01:14:25.413
<v Joshua Gay:>to support the educator who wants to

1521
01:14:25.453 --> 01:14:27.402
<v Joshua Gay:>create their own custom curriculum or add

1522
01:14:27.442 --> 01:14:27.723
<v Joshua Gay:>to it.

1523
01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:33.933
<v Joshua Gay:>So yeah, I flew out to Palo

1524
01:14:34.013 --> 01:14:35.736
<v Joshua Gay:>Alto and met with them.

1525
01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.785
<v Joshua Gay:>And even though things were going great

1526
01:14:38.926 --> 01:14:42.333
<v Joshua Gay:>at the Free Software Foundation, the opportunity

1527
01:14:43.074 --> 01:14:46.626
<v Joshua Gay:>seemed, you know, it was too perfectly

1528
01:14:46.667 --> 01:14:48.632
<v Joshua Gay:>aligned with another passion of mine that

1529
01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:50.983
<v Joshua Gay:>I had been trying to get off

1530
01:14:51.023 --> 01:14:53.468
<v Joshua Gay:>the ground and felt like the way

1531
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.473
<v Joshua Gay:>to actually do it would require a

1532
01:14:55.513 --> 01:14:56.355
<v Joshua Gay:>lot of resources.

1533
01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.308
<v Joshua Gay:>And well, the COSAs had the resources

1534
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:02.775
<v Joshua Gay:>and the passion and a shared vision.

1535
01:15:03.601 --> 01:15:06.326
<v Joshua Gay:>And they poured it in to paying

1536
01:15:07.188 --> 01:15:10.654
<v Joshua Gay:>not just writers and editors and software

1537
01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:15.807
<v Joshua Gay:>developers, but also hiring, you know, people

1538
01:15:15.847 --> 01:15:19.914
<v Joshua Gay:>to align the content to state standards,

1539
01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:22.943
<v Joshua Gay:>putting in the work of getting Governor

1540
01:15:22.983 --> 01:15:30.416
<v Joshua Gay:>Schwarzenegger to pass a governor's, you know,

1541
01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:34.665
<v Joshua Gay:>I forget what it was called, but

1542
01:15:34.686 --> 01:15:38.872
<v Joshua Gay:>it was a declaration to support free

1543
01:15:39.574 --> 01:15:41.881
<v Joshua Gay:>and open textbooks in the state of

1544
01:15:41.901 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Joshua Gay:>California for standards alignment to pilot it.

1545
01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:46.681
<v Joshua Gay:>And they were able to sort of

1546
01:15:46.701 --> 01:15:47.704
<v Joshua Gay:>be able to work at it at

1547
01:15:47.804 --> 01:15:49.490
<v Joshua Gay:>all these levels and have the resources

1548
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:50.573
<v Joshua Gay:>to marshal that.

1549
01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:53.765
<v Joshua Gay:>And they hired me for this multi

1550
01:15:53.805 --> 01:15:57.893
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of this role that sat between

1551
01:15:57.973 --> 01:16:01.643
<v Joshua Gay:>the software engineers who are creating the

1552
01:16:01.884 --> 01:16:05.432
<v Joshua Gay:>platform and the tooling and editors and

1553
01:16:05.512 --> 01:16:07.094
<v Joshua Gay:>the content producers.

1554
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:11.648
<v Joshua Gay:>And to be able to be the

1555
01:16:12.029 --> 01:16:14.032
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of the technical content editor that

1556
01:16:14.073 --> 01:16:16.563
<v Joshua Gay:>sits between them to help inform the

1557
01:16:16.603 --> 01:16:18.548
<v Joshua Gay:>design of the system, be able to

1558
01:16:18.588 --> 01:16:21.860
<v Joshua Gay:>communicate and effectively translate between the two

1559
01:16:22.762 --> 01:16:26.968
<v Joshua Gay:>and to create and host an intermediary

1560
01:16:27.029 --> 01:16:27.951
<v Joshua Gay:>solution for them.

1561
01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:30.856
<v Joshua Gay:>So I set up the same software

1562
01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:35.631
<v Joshua Gay:>that Wikipedia uses, MediaWiki instance that allowed

1563
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:38.744
<v Joshua Gay:>for things to be input kind of

1564
01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:42.372
<v Joshua Gay:>somewhat easily converting from Word documents and

1565
01:16:42.412 --> 01:16:44.061
<v Joshua Gay:>other things that the writers were using

1566
01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:46.587
<v Joshua Gay:>into a more, you know, text based

1567
01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:49.634
<v Joshua Gay:>structured thing that could then be kind

1568
01:16:49.655 --> 01:16:53.186
<v Joshua Gay:>of ready to feed into this online

1569
01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:56.090
<v Joshua Gay:>tool and system and archive.

1570
01:16:57.173 --> 01:16:58.676
<v Joshua Gay:>And so that was just an amazing

1571
01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.361
<v Joshua Gay:>opportunity.

1572
01:17:00.623 --> 01:17:02.505
<v Joshua Gay:>And it was a great, you know,

1573
01:17:02.867 --> 01:17:05.871
<v Joshua Gay:>almost two years of my life where

1574
01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:09.141
<v Joshua Gay:>I would go out there often two

1575
01:17:09.161 --> 01:17:11.084
<v Joshua Gay:>or three weeks at a time and

1576
01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:13.027
<v Joshua Gay:>then come back and work remotely.

1577
01:17:13.047 --> 01:17:20.003
<v Joshua Gay:>But it became, you know, most of

1578
01:17:20.043 --> 01:17:22.108
<v Joshua Gay:>my focus where I had a lot

1579
01:17:22.128 --> 01:17:24.193
<v Joshua Gay:>of side projects going on over that

1580
01:17:24.213 --> 01:17:28.408
<v Joshua Gay:>two year period but before then, most

1581
01:17:28.428 --> 01:17:29.831
<v Joshua Gay:>of those went away because this was

1582
01:17:29.891 --> 01:17:31.375
<v Joshua Gay:>just something to get off the ground

1583
01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.344
<v Joshua Gay:>and build momentum behind.

1584
01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:36.592
<v Joshua Gay:>And I think I maybe burnt out

1585
01:17:36.672 --> 01:17:37.815
<v Joshua Gay:>a bit after two years.

1586
01:17:40.044 --> 01:17:42.869
<v Joshua Gay:>It became a bit much, but it's

1587
01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:45.894
<v Joshua Gay:>gone on to be a very successful

1588
01:17:45.935 --> 01:17:50.328
<v Joshua Gay:>project, getting them sort of through their

1589
01:17:50.368 --> 01:17:53.133
<v Joshua Gay:>pilot program and getting books into school

1590
01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:55.501
<v Joshua Gay:>systems at the state level in multiple

1591
01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:57.928
<v Joshua Gay:>states felt like I was a part

1592
01:17:57.968 --> 01:18:00.334
<v Joshua Gay:>of something really big and a really

1593
01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:02.884
<v Joshua Gay:>hard problem at the time that helped

1594
01:18:02.925 --> 01:18:04.669
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of, you know, break through a

1595
01:18:04.689 --> 01:18:06.974
<v Joshua Gay:>barrier that now many are able to

1596
01:18:07.014 --> 01:18:08.102
<v Joshua Gay:>more easily get through.

1597
01:18:08.162 --> 01:18:11.349
<v Joshua Gay:>You can get sort of these other

1598
01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:14.061
<v Joshua Gay:>learning platforms accepted into schools of these

1599
01:18:14.101 --> 01:18:15.925
<v Joshua Gay:>different ways more easily.

1600
01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:18.992
<v Joshua Gay:>And I think CK12 Foundation and the

1601
01:18:19.013 --> 01:18:20.942
<v Joshua Gay:>Coastals really helped do that.

1602
01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:25.471
<v Joshua Gay:>Mergen Pal had a background in doing

1603
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:26.073
<v Joshua Gay:>open source.

1604
01:18:26.113 --> 01:18:28.944
<v Joshua Gay:>He had a company previously that was

1605
01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:31.510
<v Joshua Gay:>focused on providing open source consultancy and

1606
01:18:31.531 --> 01:18:34.203
<v Joshua Gay:>services to other tech tech companies in

1607
01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:35.005
<v Joshua Gay:>Silicon Valley.

1608
01:18:35.065 --> 01:18:36.107
<v Joshua Gay:>So we really hit it off.

1609
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:39.695
<v Joshua Gay:>He's a brilliant architect in terms of

1610
01:18:40.361 --> 01:18:42.767
<v Joshua Gay:>how to go about building an information

1611
01:18:42.807 --> 01:18:44.993
<v Joshua Gay:>system that could achieve these sort of

1612
01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:45.715
<v Joshua Gay:>lofty goals.

1613
01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.445
<v Joshua Gay:>And it was a really special time

1614
01:18:48.485 --> 01:18:49.808
<v Joshua Gay:>in my life to have been a

1615
01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:50.670
<v Joshua Gay:>part of that.

1616
01:18:52.313 --> 01:18:56.327
<v Joshua Gay:>And after I finished that work, I

1617
01:18:56.347 --> 01:18:58.613
<v Joshua Gay:>didn't go straight back to the Free

1618
01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:02.366
<v Joshua Gay:>Software Foundation, but I was fortunate enough

1619
01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.031
<v Joshua Gay:>to get some contracting work.

1620
01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:09.423
<v Joshua Gay:>I worked with Mozilla and Peer2Peer U.

1621
01:19:10.886 --> 01:19:12.729
<v Joshua Gay:>I was able to help them launch

1622
01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:17.981
<v Joshua Gay:>their first open badges system, which really

1623
01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.605
<v Joshua Gay:>built on a lot of that kind

1624
01:19:19.645 --> 01:19:22.131
<v Joshua Gay:>of visionary education work.

1625
01:19:22.613 --> 01:19:26.084
<v Joshua Gay:>What does it look like to put

1626
01:19:26.425 --> 01:19:28.289
<v Joshua Gay:>work out into the world, right?

1627
01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:31.915
<v Joshua Gay:>To basically, here's how you can put

1628
01:19:31.936 --> 01:19:34.304
<v Joshua Gay:>a badge pathway out into the world

1629
01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:36.812
<v Joshua Gay:>of curriculum that can be followed and

1630
01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.861
<v Joshua Gay:>recognized that isn't part of the formal

1631
01:19:38.921 --> 01:19:41.445
<v Joshua Gay:>education system per se, but could be.

1632
01:19:41.465 --> 01:19:49.302
<v Joshua Gay:>And to find some subtle, important choices

1633
01:19:49.383 --> 01:19:51.166
<v Joshua Gay:>about what this would look like.

1634
01:19:51.408 --> 01:19:54.195
<v Joshua Gay:>Embedding metadata in the image itself was,

1635
01:19:55.723 --> 01:19:57.587
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, here's the image of a

1636
01:19:57.687 --> 01:19:58.970
<v Joshua Gay:>badge recognition.

1637
01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:01.956
<v Joshua Gay:>It carries with it this metadata about

1638
01:20:02.902 --> 01:20:04.364
<v Joshua Gay:>who awarded it to you, what it

1639
01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:09.454
<v Joshua Gay:>means, some sort of fundamental decisions early

1640
01:20:09.654 --> 01:20:10.900
<v Joshua Gay:>on I got to be a part

1641
01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:11.081
<v Joshua Gay:>of.

1642
01:20:11.923 --> 01:20:12.884
<v Joshua Gay:>And I got to be a part

1643
01:20:12.965 --> 01:20:16.713
<v Joshua Gay:>of a process of facilitating many different

1644
01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:19.544
<v Joshua Gay:>kinds of stakeholders and potentially interested parties

1645
01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:22.572
<v Joshua Gay:>and hosting events where we were able

1646
01:20:22.612 --> 01:20:24.299
<v Joshua Gay:>to fly them in and get together

1647
01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:27.084
<v Joshua Gay:>in a room and brainstorm.

1648
01:20:27.806 --> 01:20:32.354
<v Joshua Gay:>And then have a week-long sprint of

1649
01:20:32.434 --> 01:20:35.945
<v Joshua Gay:>doing this work with collaborators in Barcelona,

1650
01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.872
<v Joshua Gay:>Spain, where we ran the badge lab

1651
01:20:38.892 --> 01:20:43.026
<v Joshua Gay:>and badge workshops at the first Mozilla

1652
01:20:43.146 --> 01:20:44.890
<v Joshua Gay:>Festival, which I believe it's called the

1653
01:20:45.671 --> 01:20:46.653
<v Joshua Gay:>Mozilla Festival now.

1654
01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:49.063
<v Joshua Gay:>Back then, they had branded it their

1655
01:20:49.424 --> 01:20:50.366
<v Joshua Gay:>drumbeat festival.

1656
01:20:50.747 --> 01:20:53.834
<v Joshua Gay:>And that was really wonderful with Peer

1657
01:20:53.854 --> 01:21:00.366
<v Joshua Gay:>to Peer U, an initiative of sort

1658
01:21:00.406 --> 01:21:04.253
<v Joshua Gay:>of peer to peer educating on a

1659
01:21:04.313 --> 01:21:04.934
<v Joshua Gay:>platform.

1660
01:21:04.954 --> 01:21:10.103
<v Joshua Gay:>I got to work on a number

1661
01:21:10.244 --> 01:21:13.148
<v Joshua Gay:>of similar kind of education initiatives that

1662
01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:16.916
<v Joshua Gay:>melded it well into the badging ecosystem.

1663
01:21:17.621 --> 01:21:20.467
<v Joshua Gay:>That was a really great interlude between

1664
01:21:20.628 --> 01:21:23.153
<v Joshua Gay:>CK12 and going back to the Free

1665
01:21:23.173 --> 01:21:26.985
<v Joshua Gay:>Software Foundation, where I came back briefly

1666
01:21:27.086 --> 01:21:29.711
<v Joshua Gay:>as the campaigns manager again and sort

1667
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:35.045
<v Joshua Gay:>of imposing digital restrictions management and promoting

1668
01:21:35.406 --> 01:21:40.215
<v Joshua Gay:>open formats and raising awareness about how

1669
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.748
<v Joshua Gay:>patents and the threat of patents that

1670
01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.914
<v Joshua Gay:>gets freed up with our software really

1671
01:21:49.724 --> 01:21:54.372
<v Joshua Gay:>create this huge threat and burden to

1672
01:21:54.573 --> 01:21:56.256
<v Joshua Gay:>transitioning from all of that work to

1673
01:21:57.362 --> 01:22:00.309
<v Joshua Gay:>being the licensing and compliance manager for

1674
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.874
<v Joshua Gay:>the Free Software Foundation, which led to

1675
01:22:02.975 --> 01:22:05.626
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of in in my mind, a

1676
01:22:05.927 --> 01:22:07.371
<v Joshua Gay:>lot of similar type of work of

1677
01:22:07.451 --> 01:22:10.042
<v Joshua Gay:>getting to engage the community, not necessarily

1678
01:22:10.082 --> 01:22:13.068
<v Joshua Gay:>needing to try to do this is

1679
01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:16.214
<v Joshua Gay:>so urgent type campaigning, where every issue

1680
01:22:16.234 --> 01:22:19.425
<v Joshua Gay:>is, you know, a giant urgent threat

1681
01:22:19.465 --> 01:22:21.008
<v Joshua Gay:>that you need to take action now

1682
01:22:21.409 --> 01:22:21.549
<v Joshua Gay:>on.

1683
01:22:23.113 --> 01:22:24.940
<v Joshua Gay:>It was, you know, a slightly slower

1684
01:22:24.981 --> 01:22:27.546
<v Joshua Gay:>pace, but equally rewarding.

1685
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:31.492
<v Joshua Gay:>Basically, they have an email address, licensing

1686
01:22:31.554 --> 01:22:34.646
<v Joshua Gay:>at fsf.org, and whether you're a lawyer

1687
01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:36.250
<v Joshua Gay:>or a developer or whomever, and you

1688
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:39.465
<v Joshua Gay:>have questions about freedom of software licensing,

1689
01:22:40.769 --> 01:22:42.353
<v Joshua Gay:>you just email them and then they'll

1690
01:22:42.453 --> 01:22:42.794
<v Joshua Gay:>answer you.

1691
01:22:45.704 --> 01:22:47.909
<v Joshua Gay:>And it turns out that the new

1692
01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.733
<v Joshua Gay:>general public license and the suite of

1693
01:22:49.773 --> 01:22:51.982
<v Joshua Gay:>licenses being the most adopted and used

1694
01:22:52.723 --> 01:22:55.229
<v Joshua Gay:>freedom of software license in the world

1695
01:22:55.269 --> 01:22:57.213
<v Joshua Gay:>at the time, led to a very

1696
01:22:57.293 --> 01:23:00.483
<v Joshua Gay:>large volume of people asking for help

1697
01:23:00.585 --> 01:23:03.290
<v Joshua Gay:>and support and often in very, you

1698
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:06.841
<v Joshua Gay:>know, important situations of their company or

1699
01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.745
<v Joshua Gay:>whatever it may be, their project.

1700
01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:13.013
<v Joshua Gay:>And so that was a very rewarding

1701
01:23:14.135 --> 01:23:14.960
<v Joshua Gay:>thing to be a part of.

1702
01:23:15.662 --> 01:23:18.607
<v Joshua Gay:>I got even, whereas I felt the

1703
01:23:18.987 --> 01:23:23.515
<v Joshua Gay:>campaigns management work definitely allowed me to

1704
01:23:23.576 --> 01:23:25.262
<v Joshua Gay:>connect to so many people in the

1705
01:23:25.282 --> 01:23:25.603
<v Joshua Gay:>public.

1706
01:23:27.005 --> 01:23:30.332
<v Joshua Gay:>I think that the licensing and compliance

1707
01:23:30.392 --> 01:23:33.300
<v Joshua Gay:>lab work was tenfold, in a sense.

1708
01:23:33.381 --> 01:23:35.146
<v Joshua Gay:>There was just so many more people

1709
01:23:35.206 --> 01:23:38.314
<v Joshua Gay:>that I was directly helping day to

1710
01:23:38.354 --> 01:23:38.595
<v Joshua Gay:>day.

1711
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.125
<v Joshua Gay:>And at the same time, also being

1712
01:23:45.165 --> 01:23:50.213
<v Joshua Gay:>able to sort of do work at

1713
01:23:50.253 --> 01:23:50.874
<v Joshua Gay:>another level.

1714
01:23:50.935 --> 01:23:54.504
<v Joshua Gay:>So I was able to write, you

1715
01:23:54.544 --> 01:23:58.032
<v Joshua Gay:>know, requests for comments from the government

1716
01:23:58.112 --> 01:23:59.981
<v Joshua Gay:>when new things are happening and they're

1717
01:24:00.021 --> 01:24:02.749
<v Joshua Gay:>printed in the federal register, you know,

1718
01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:04.733
<v Joshua Gay:>you can go ahead and submit comments.

1719
01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.242
<v Joshua Gay:>So I was able to do that

1720
01:24:06.322 --> 01:24:09.508
<v Joshua Gay:>and, you know, set up meeting with

1721
01:24:09.548 --> 01:24:11.512
<v Joshua Gay:>the FCC at one time.

1722
01:24:11.652 --> 01:24:17.107
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, even though it was,

1723
01:24:17.448 --> 01:24:19.352
<v Joshua Gay:>you know, for that work, it was

1724
01:24:20.073 --> 01:24:22.442
<v Joshua Gay:>one and a half employees with occasional

1725
01:24:22.503 --> 01:24:23.304
<v Joshua Gay:>input from others.

1726
01:24:24.507 --> 01:24:25.789
<v Joshua Gay:>It felt like we were able to

1727
01:24:25.849 --> 01:24:28.875
<v Joshua Gay:>have this huge impact on being able

1728
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.567
<v Joshua Gay:>to have this grounding in a very

1729
01:24:34.128 --> 01:24:38.455
<v Joshua Gay:>fundamentally important part of this, of digital

1730
01:24:38.515 --> 01:24:39.821
<v Joshua Gay:>infrastructure, the licensing.

1731
01:24:40.622 --> 01:24:45.029
<v Joshua Gay:>It created this sort of inroad to

1732
01:24:46.951 --> 01:24:49.635
<v Joshua Gay:>let's make sure that the policies or

1733
01:24:49.696 --> 01:24:53.465
<v Joshua Gay:>the laws and other things are sort

1734
01:24:53.485 --> 01:24:55.789
<v Joshua Gay:>of all fitting well together, right?

1735
01:24:56.871 --> 01:25:00.721
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, if this policy requires certain

1736
01:25:00.742 --> 01:25:03.648
<v Joshua Gay:>conditions, it means that these licenses could

1737
01:25:03.748 --> 01:25:07.981
<v Joshua Gay:>not be used and be legal in

1738
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:08.983
<v Joshua Gay:>certain cases, right?

1739
01:25:09.444 --> 01:25:12.030
<v Joshua Gay:>And so that is a very real

1740
01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:12.250
<v Joshua Gay:>thing.

1741
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:13.352
<v Joshua Gay:>It's not theoretic.

1742
01:25:14.014 --> 01:25:16.244
<v Joshua Gay:>Here's all the software under these licenses

1743
01:25:16.304 --> 01:25:17.748
<v Joshua Gay:>and here's why they can't run on

1744
01:25:17.789 --> 01:25:19.293
<v Joshua Gay:>these devices if you have these laws.

1745
01:25:19.921 --> 01:25:22.866
<v Joshua Gay:>And it's very concrete and not philosophical.

1746
01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:27.275
<v Joshua Gay:>I mean, maybe you can frame it

1747
01:25:27.335 --> 01:25:28.621
<v Joshua Gay:>as being grounded in ethics or you

1748
01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:30.365
<v Joshua Gay:>can just be practical and say, a

1749
01:25:31.207 --> 01:25:34.375
<v Joshua Gay:>bunch of freely available software can't run

1750
01:25:34.435 --> 01:25:37.325
<v Joshua Gay:>on these legally and be in compliance.

1751
01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:41.252
<v Joshua Gay:>So that was a really powerful sort

1752
01:25:41.392 --> 01:25:43.356
<v Joshua Gay:>of work I got to be a

1753
01:25:43.416 --> 01:25:46.187
<v Joshua Gay:>part of that could, you know, go

1754
01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:47.731
<v Joshua Gay:>out there and sort of advocate for

1755
01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:49.259
<v Joshua Gay:>the free and open source software world.

1756
01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:52.046
<v Joshua Gay:>Able to work with the Creative Commons

1757
01:25:53.488 --> 01:25:56.594
<v Joshua Gay:>when they did their, I believe, the

1758
01:25:56.594 --> 01:25:58.141
<v Joshua Gay:>4.0 suite of licenses.

1759
01:25:58.161 --> 01:26:00.846
<v Joshua Gay:>I was able to work closely with

1760
01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:05.213
<v Joshua Gay:>their lawyers on compatibility of CC BISA

1761
01:26:05.213 --> 01:26:07.822
<v Joshua Gay:>4.0 and the GNU GPL.

1762
01:26:07.882 --> 01:26:10.748
<v Joshua Gay:>So you're able to get into what

1763
01:26:10.768 --> 01:26:12.171
<v Joshua Gay:>got published.

1764
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:13.233
<v Joshua Gay:>It is compatible.

1765
01:26:13.313 --> 01:26:15.306
<v Joshua Gay:>You can take a CC BISA 4.0

1766
01:26:15.782 --> 01:26:17.505
<v Joshua Gay:>work and you can relicense it as

1767
01:26:18.287 --> 01:26:21.933
<v Joshua Gay:>a GNU GPL version 3.0 license work.

1768
01:26:22.073 --> 01:26:24.481
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, for some people that

1769
01:26:25.502 --> 01:26:29.107
<v Joshua Gay:>wasn't usually important, but where it matters

1770
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:32.152
<v Joshua Gay:>has been very important.

1771
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.465
<v Joshua Gay:>It allows for people to go from

1772
01:26:37.505 --> 01:26:39.210
<v Joshua Gay:>that sort of creative level of work

1773
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.541
<v Joshua Gay:>to be able to move it into

1774
01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:43.526
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of the free and open source

1775
01:26:43.586 --> 01:26:46.073
<v Joshua Gay:>software licensing world from a Creative Commons

1776
01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:48.424
<v Joshua Gay:>licensing world and bridging that gap and

1777
01:26:48.464 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Joshua Gay:>making sure that the licenses are sort

1778
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:55.143
<v Joshua Gay:>of, you know, in everybody's view, comparable

1779
01:26:55.204 --> 01:26:56.688
<v Joshua Gay:>enough, right?

1780
01:26:56.748 --> 01:26:58.852
<v Joshua Gay:>And getting that buy-in and acceptance from

1781
01:26:59.053 --> 01:27:02.986
<v Joshua Gay:>communities that these are solving similar problems

1782
01:27:03.046 --> 01:27:05.952
<v Joshua Gay:>and that they're considered compatible.

1783
01:27:07.415 --> 01:27:09.004
<v Joshua Gay:>You can't go the other direction because

1784
01:27:09.084 --> 01:27:10.909
<v Joshua Gay:>of the terms of the GNU General

1785
01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Joshua Gay:>Public License.

1786
01:27:11.531 --> 01:27:13.744
<v Joshua Gay:>It doesn't allow you to relicense in

1787
01:27:13.904 --> 01:27:15.528
<v Joshua Gay:>other terms that are not the GNU

1788
01:27:15.548 --> 01:27:16.410
<v Joshua Gay:>General Public License.

1789
01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:19.222
<v Joshua Gay:>But getting that one-way compatibility was hard

1790
01:27:19.262 --> 01:27:19.543
<v Joshua Gay:>enough.

1791
01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:23.291
<v Joshua Gay:>And that was a really great thing

1792
01:27:23.331 --> 01:27:23.993
<v Joshua Gay:>to be a part of.

1793
01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:29.626
<v Joshua Gay:>We were able to make some, interact

1794
01:27:29.687 --> 01:27:32.071
<v Joshua Gay:>with the W3C standards on the web

1795
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:35.797
<v Joshua Gay:>to have license tags in HTML be

1796
01:27:38.923 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Joshua Gay:>accepted when deciding if a website is

1797
01:27:45.312 --> 01:27:49.017
<v Joshua Gay:>fully in compliance with the W3C standards.

1798
01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:51.186
<v Joshua Gay:>Here are some custom tags.

1799
01:27:51.226 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Joshua Gay:>We were able to work with a

1800
01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:57.063
<v Joshua Gay:>community called the Microformats community as an

1801
01:27:57.183 --> 01:28:02.991
<v Joshua Gay:>intermediary to create, to make those tags

1802
01:28:03.131 --> 01:28:06.816
<v Joshua Gay:>considered, accepted as part of HTML5.

1803
01:28:08.723 --> 01:28:10.708
<v Joshua Gay:>You know, and these are just things

1804
01:28:10.748 --> 01:28:17.524
<v Joshua Gay:>that are, they're not necessarily a big

1805
01:28:17.544 --> 01:28:20.269
<v Joshua Gay:>deal for the Free Software Foundation.

1806
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.375
<v Joshua Gay:>But the idea that we're working across

1807
01:28:23.455 --> 01:28:26.206
<v Joshua Gay:>so many different types of communities where

1808
01:28:26.526 --> 01:28:28.291
<v Joshua Gay:>free and open source software matters and

1809
01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:33.105
<v Joshua Gay:>these licensing issues or these technical issues

1810
01:28:33.286 --> 01:28:36.211
<v Joshua Gay:>are run into a problem.

1811
01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:42.526
<v Joshua Gay:>Having that compatibility means that a person

1812
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:46.293
<v Joshua Gay:>who has a policy in their job

1813
01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:48.120
<v Joshua Gay:>or in their government, that it has

1814
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:50.186
<v Joshua Gay:>to pass all the tests in order

1815
01:28:50.206 --> 01:28:51.149
<v Joshua Gay:>for them to use that.

1816
01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:53.600
<v Joshua Gay:>If it doesn't pass the tests, they

1817
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:54.361
<v Joshua Gay:>don't get to use it.

1818
01:28:54.902 --> 01:28:56.063
<v Joshua Gay:>If it does, they do.

1819
01:28:56.565 --> 01:28:57.728
<v Joshua Gay:>It's as simple as that.

1820
01:28:57.748 --> 01:29:03.422
<v Joshua Gay:>But understanding that there are these sort

1821
01:29:03.542 --> 01:29:10.092
<v Joshua Gay:>of keystones to sort of the global

1822
01:29:10.573 --> 01:29:12.640
<v Joshua Gay:>digital infrastructure and the policies of the

1823
01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:17.371
<v Joshua Gay:>laws was really, you know, it was

1824
01:29:17.391 --> 01:29:19.375
<v Joshua Gay:>a privilege to be able to be

1825
01:29:22.644 --> 01:29:24.007
<v Joshua Gay:>able to sort of sit in between

1826
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:27.615
<v Joshua Gay:>communities of people, their problems, suggestions on

1827
01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.842
<v Joshua Gay:>where that problem is.

1828
01:29:29.303 --> 01:29:30.988
<v Joshua Gay:>That'd be able to go advocate and

1829
01:29:31.028 --> 01:29:34.055
<v Joshua Gay:>make changes on their behalf.

1830
01:29:34.055 --> 01:29:39.608
<v Joshua Gay:>It It was really just a privilege.

1831
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:42.133
<v Joshua Gay:>It was really great work and I'm

1832
01:29:42.154 --> 01:29:43.900
<v Joshua Gay:>proud of what we were able to

1833
01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.183
<v Joshua Gay:>accomplish in those few years that I

1834
01:29:46.223 --> 01:29:46.702
<v Joshua Gay:>worked with them.

1835
01:29:46.723 --> 01:29:48.325
<v Karen Herman:>When did you leave?

1836
01:29:48.325 --> 01:29:58.520
<v Joshua Gay:>In 2017, I guess it would be.

1837
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.124
<v Joshua Gay:>I think that's right.

1838
01:30:01.144 --> 01:30:05.150
<v Joshua Gay:>Is that right?

1839
01:30:05.591 --> 01:30:05.831
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah.

1840
01:30:06.072 --> 01:30:07.734
<v Joshua Gay:>I guess it'll be my sixth year

1841
01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.081
<v Joshua Gay:>at the IEEE where I work now,

1842
01:30:10.662 --> 01:30:11.983
<v Joshua Gay:>the IEEE Standard Association.

1843
01:30:12.004 --> 01:30:17.171
<v Joshua Gay:>What led me here, really, that work

1844
01:30:17.191 --> 01:30:24.064
<v Joshua Gay:>started when I was with the Free

1845
01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:24.905
<v Joshua Gay:>Software Foundation.

1846
01:30:27.429 --> 01:30:29.592
<v Joshua Gay:>I was invited to be a member

1847
01:30:29.712 --> 01:30:34.824
<v Joshua Gay:>of an associate of the Berkman Center,

1848
01:30:35.226 --> 01:30:36.730
<v Joshua Gay:>which is now the Berkman Clyde Center

1849
01:30:36.871 --> 01:30:37.753
<v Joshua Gay:>at Harvard Law School.

1850
01:30:41.383 --> 01:30:42.925
<v Joshua Gay:>They run a cyber law clinic and

1851
01:30:42.966 --> 01:30:45.731
<v Joshua Gay:>they sort of this melting pot of

1852
01:30:47.113 --> 01:30:49.840
<v Joshua Gay:>think tank type group at the intersection

1853
01:30:49.881 --> 01:30:53.306
<v Joshua Gay:>of policy and law and technology.

1854
01:30:53.326 --> 01:31:01.457
<v Joshua Gay:>I was invited to come and be

1855
01:31:02.001 --> 01:31:02.642
<v Joshua Gay:>an associate.

1856
01:31:03.243 --> 01:31:05.346
<v Joshua Gay:>They have fellows and associates there.

1857
01:31:09.053 --> 01:31:10.956
<v Joshua Gay:>During my time there, one of the

1858
01:31:10.996 --> 01:31:15.286
<v Joshua Gay:>things I did was try to reflect

1859
01:31:15.386 --> 01:31:19.793
<v Joshua Gay:>on this idea of there being this

1860
01:31:19.853 --> 01:31:22.517
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of global digital infrastructure.

1861
01:31:28.605 --> 01:31:30.830
<v Joshua Gay:>There's this feeling of free software.

1862
01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:31.592
<v Joshua Gay:>It opens our software.

1863
01:31:31.612 --> 01:31:34.883
<v Joshua Gay:>It's starting to be accepted by business,

1864
01:31:35.164 --> 01:31:39.992
<v Joshua Gay:>by consumers, things like Android and other

1865
01:31:40.393 --> 01:31:43.942
<v Joshua Gay:>platforms really that were open source at

1866
01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:46.427
<v Joshua Gay:>the time, really just sort of shifting

1867
01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:48.691
<v Joshua Gay:>the marketplace.

1868
01:31:49.533 --> 01:31:50.835
<v Joshua Gay:>All of a sudden, put the importance

1869
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:56.471
<v Joshua Gay:>on looking at global institutions, it just

1870
01:31:56.491 --> 01:31:57.373
<v Joshua Gay:>made it more important.

1871
01:31:57.433 --> 01:31:58.155
<v Joshua Gay:>How do we go from where we

1872
01:31:58.175 --> 01:32:01.646
<v Joshua Gay:>are now, kind of as this grassroots,

1873
01:32:04.291 --> 01:32:06.555
<v Joshua Gay:>to bringing the same ethos of the

1874
01:32:06.595 --> 01:32:08.452
<v Joshua Gay:>grassroots into the institution so it's into

1875
01:32:08.452 --> 01:32:09.865
<v Joshua Gay:>the institution so it's not just captured

1876
01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:13.111
<v Joshua Gay:>by just the corporate address who's accepting

1877
01:32:13.171 --> 01:32:13.431
<v Joshua Gay:>it now?

1878
01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:18.665
<v Joshua Gay:>The one blog post I wrote while

1879
01:32:18.685 --> 01:32:22.133
<v Joshua Gay:>I was there, and it's still up,

1880
01:32:22.213 --> 01:32:22.974
<v Joshua Gay:>I guess I wrote two.

1881
01:32:23.155 --> 01:32:24.548
<v Joshua Gay:>One was on health and fitness, health

1882
01:32:24.548 --> 01:32:25.434
<v Joshua Gay:>and fitness, health and fitness, health and

1883
01:32:25.434 --> 01:32:26.727
<v Joshua Gay:>fitness, an area I was exploring.

1884
01:32:27.128 --> 01:32:29.072
<v Joshua Gay:>Maybe this is a way that I

1885
01:32:29.112 --> 01:32:31.260
<v Joshua Gay:>could touch more lives and can matter,

1886
01:32:32.122 --> 01:32:34.827
<v Joshua Gay:>but that felt like a dead end

1887
01:32:34.887 --> 01:32:36.970
<v Joshua Gay:>and not quite big enough.

1888
01:32:38.112 --> 01:32:40.616
<v Joshua Gay:>So what I started to focus on

1889
01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:44.529
<v Joshua Gay:>was standards and standardization and starting really

1890
01:32:44.609 --> 01:32:46.634
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of how do we go the

1891
01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:47.942
<v Joshua Gay:>other direction, not how do we get

1892
01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:51.151
<v Joshua Gay:>standards development orgs and those who value

1893
01:32:51.372 --> 01:32:54.866
<v Joshua Gay:>standardization, but how do we help influence

1894
01:32:55.006 --> 01:32:57.753
<v Joshua Gay:>the free software projects and open source

1895
01:32:57.773 --> 01:32:59.862
<v Joshua Gay:>software projects to start to think about

1896
01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:00.523
<v Joshua Gay:>standards?

1897
01:33:01.244 --> 01:33:03.608
<v Joshua Gay:>And so the focus was on how

1898
01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:08.380
<v Joshua Gay:>to prepare for standardization at the start

1899
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.225
<v Joshua Gay:>of your project, how to approach your

1900
01:33:12.488 --> 01:33:15.954
<v Joshua Gay:>open source project as maybe later on

1901
01:33:16.014 --> 01:33:20.686
<v Joshua Gay:>in its life becoming the start or

1902
01:33:21.067 --> 01:33:24.733
<v Joshua Gay:>the basis for a technology, an industry

1903
01:33:24.774 --> 01:33:25.936
<v Joshua Gay:>standard, a global standard.

1904
01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:29.644
<v Joshua Gay:>And this really led down sort of

1905
01:33:31.367 --> 01:33:34.331
<v Joshua Gay:>eventually when I left the FSF and

1906
01:33:36.314 --> 01:33:41.965
<v Joshua Gay:>started to look for my next major

1907
01:33:42.026 --> 01:33:43.368
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of thing that I wanted to

1908
01:33:43.408 --> 01:33:46.754
<v Joshua Gay:>be a part of, eventually ended up

1909
01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:49.244
<v Joshua Gay:>with the IEEE standards association where we're

1910
01:33:50.968 --> 01:33:52.612
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of coming at it from both

1911
01:33:52.633 --> 01:33:53.114
<v Joshua Gay:>directions.

1912
01:33:53.134 --> 01:33:55.466
<v Joshua Gay:>We're a a unified platform and support

1913
01:33:55.526 --> 01:33:57.593
<v Joshua Gay:>for general free and open source software

1914
01:33:57.613 --> 01:34:01.806
<v Joshua Gay:>projects, which is great, but also we've

1915
01:34:02.507 --> 01:34:07.916
<v Joshua Gay:>updated our policies and procedures to allow

1916
01:34:08.522 --> 01:34:10.746
<v Joshua Gay:>our standards working groups to incorporate open

1917
01:34:10.788 --> 01:34:13.174
<v Joshua Gay:>source at any number of ways in

1918
01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:15.263
<v Joshua Gay:>there into their standards.

1919
01:34:15.805 --> 01:34:17.087
<v Joshua Gay:>And so sort of coming at it

1920
01:34:17.127 --> 01:34:20.775
<v Joshua Gay:>from both ends has been really great.

1921
01:34:20.835 --> 01:34:24.285
<v Joshua Gay:>It's been able to do exactly sort

1922
01:34:24.345 --> 01:34:29.353
<v Joshua Gay:>of this idea, this direction that I

1923
01:34:29.413 --> 01:34:30.935
<v Joshua Gay:>hoped we could go, I could bring

1924
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.001
<v Joshua Gay:>my career.

1925
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:34.806
<v Joshua Gay:>And I was just lucky enough that

1926
01:34:35.788 --> 01:34:39.634
<v Joshua Gay:>the one major international standards org needed

1927
01:34:39.656 --> 01:34:43.307
<v Joshua Gay:>a full-time remote open source specialist that

1928
01:34:43.347 --> 01:34:46.813
<v Joshua Gay:>had a background in licensing and software

1929
01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:51.126
<v Joshua Gay:>development and community management and all the

1930
01:34:51.166 --> 01:34:55.553
<v Joshua Gay:>different hats I've ever worn was more

1931
01:34:55.574 --> 01:34:57.701
<v Joshua Gay:>or less what was the list of

1932
01:34:57.781 --> 01:34:58.903
<v Joshua Gay:>this would be nice to have in

1933
01:34:59.323 --> 01:34:59.864
<v Joshua Gay:>this job.

1934
01:35:00.004 --> 01:35:01.086
<v Joshua Gay:>It felt written for me.

1935
01:35:01.106 --> 01:35:07.941
<v Joshua Gay:>And it's hard to imagine actually at

1936
01:35:07.961 --> 01:35:09.604
<v Joshua Gay:>this point in my life ever leaving

1937
01:35:10.466 --> 01:35:11.327
<v Joshua Gay:>the IEEE.

1938
01:35:11.869 --> 01:35:16.701
<v Joshua Gay:>It really is an institution that is

1939
01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:21.128
<v Joshua Gay:>a global member-driven, member-run 501c3 nonprofit doing

1940
01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:27.202
<v Joshua Gay:>work that matters at an institutional level.

1941
01:35:28.043 --> 01:35:31.510
<v Joshua Gay:>And, you know, I should disclaim on

1942
01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:34.836
<v Joshua Gay:>this talk that all of my opinions

1943
01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.902
<v Joshua Gay:>are my own and not of my

1944
01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:36.745
<v Joshua Gay:>employer right now.

1945
01:35:36.765 --> 01:35:39.010
<v Karen Herman:>What does IEEE stand for?

1946
01:35:39.031 --> 01:35:41.321
<v Karen Herman:>You should probably clarify that.

1947
01:35:41.762 --> 01:35:45.768
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, so the Institute of Electrical and

1948
01:35:45.788 --> 01:35:46.830
<v Joshua Gay:>Electronics Engineers.

1949
01:35:48.633 --> 01:35:50.960
<v Joshua Gay:>This is its second name.

1950
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.584
<v Joshua Gay:>It was the American Institute of Electrical

1951
01:35:52.624 --> 01:35:54.768
<v Joshua Gay:>Engineers in the 1880s or 1890s when

1952
01:35:54.788 --> 01:35:56.251
<v Joshua Gay:>it incorporated.

1953
01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.224
<v Joshua Gay:>And then when they merged with the

1954
01:36:00.324 --> 01:36:04.073
<v Joshua Gay:>Radio Institute of America, I can't remember

1955
01:36:04.093 --> 01:36:10.068
<v Joshua Gay:>the name of the other technical society

1956
01:36:10.108 --> 01:36:11.991
<v Joshua Gay:>they merged with in the 60s.

1957
01:36:13.012 --> 01:36:15.256
<v Joshua Gay:>They did a name revision and a

1958
01:36:15.296 --> 01:36:16.401
<v Joshua Gay:>merger at the same time.

1959
01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:22.770
<v Joshua Gay:>So the AIEE became the IEEE.

1960
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:26.316
<v Joshua Gay:>The name doesn't necessarily match up with

1961
01:36:26.356 --> 01:36:27.501
<v Joshua Gay:>what they do, per se.

1962
01:36:28.643 --> 01:36:31.166
<v Joshua Gay:>They cover sort of a very wide

1963
01:36:31.207 --> 01:36:36.476
<v Joshua Gay:>range of technical endeavors, all engineering still,

1964
01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:41.247
<v Joshua Gay:>very technical, with a focus on local

1965
01:36:41.648 --> 01:36:48.402
<v Joshua Gay:>work, promoting scholarly publications, innovation, and standardization,

1966
01:36:49.663 --> 01:36:57.615
<v Joshua Gay:>but with a mission for promoting technology

1967
01:36:57.655 --> 01:37:00.382
<v Joshua Gay:>for the benefit of humanity, which is

1968
01:37:00.943 --> 01:37:04.449
<v Joshua Gay:>sort of, as an employee there, as

1969
01:37:04.509 --> 01:37:07.775
<v Joshua Gay:>part of that community, that mission feels

1970
01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:11.646
<v Joshua Gay:>very much present in everything.

1971
01:37:11.666 --> 01:37:16.494
<v Joshua Gay:>You really feel like you are creating

1972
01:37:16.534 --> 01:37:19.163
<v Joshua Gay:>technology that's for the benefit of humanity,

1973
01:37:21.087 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Joshua Gay:>which is exciting.

1974
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:25.080
<v Joshua Gay:>And it's the most passionate group of

1975
01:37:25.141 --> 01:37:28.147
<v Joshua Gay:>volunteers I've ever worked with, who put

1976
01:37:28.187 --> 01:37:29.610
<v Joshua Gay:>in more time and energy than I

1977
01:37:30.793 --> 01:37:32.281
<v Joshua Gay:>thought was possible.

1978
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:34.005
<v Joshua Gay:>And I'm a person who has just

1979
01:37:34.005 --> 01:37:36.471
<v Joshua Gay:>spent 20 years of my career feeling

1980
01:37:36.511 --> 01:37:38.121
<v Joshua Gay:>like I put in so much extra

1981
01:37:38.161 --> 01:37:39.986
<v Joshua Gay:>time into all of these volunteer things.

1982
01:37:40.508 --> 01:37:41.951
<v Joshua Gay:>And I feel blown out of the

1983
01:37:41.992 --> 01:37:43.482
<v Joshua Gay:>water with many of the volunteers I

1984
01:37:43.502 --> 01:37:43.902
<v Joshua Gay:>work with.

1985
01:37:44.304 --> 01:37:46.489
<v Joshua Gay:>They'll put in, I'll meet with them

1986
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:48.374
<v Joshua Gay:>sometimes two or three times a week,

1987
01:37:49.462 --> 01:37:51.907
<v Joshua Gay:>now over a period of years where

1988
01:37:51.928 --> 01:37:54.534
<v Joshua Gay:>they'll be going off and flying around

1989
01:37:54.574 --> 01:37:56.603
<v Joshua Gay:>the world, giving talks of things often

1990
01:37:56.723 --> 01:37:58.387
<v Joshua Gay:>on their own dime or on their

1991
01:37:59.008 --> 01:38:02.921
<v Joshua Gay:>employer's dime, just really creating things.

1992
01:38:04.284 --> 01:38:06.709
<v Joshua Gay:>And it's exciting because here's this old

1993
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.872
<v Joshua Gay:>institution.

1994
01:38:07.932 --> 01:38:09.215
<v Joshua Gay:>It has plenty of its flaws and

1995
01:38:09.235 --> 01:38:12.607
<v Joshua Gay:>other things, but it's exciting because I'm

1996
01:38:12.628 --> 01:38:14.352
<v Joshua Gay:>learning so much from them and being

1997
01:38:14.392 --> 01:38:16.321
<v Joshua Gay:>able to bring in and share so

1998
01:38:16.362 --> 01:38:17.485
<v Joshua Gay:>much from the free and open source

1999
01:38:17.505 --> 01:38:20.534
<v Joshua Gay:>software world and this melding is happening.

2000
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.970
<v Joshua Gay:>And I feel like already we're starting

2001
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:28.073
<v Joshua Gay:>to see the benefits of that, of

2002
01:38:28.394 --> 01:38:32.204
<v Joshua Gay:>bringing together these different types of communities

2003
01:38:33.206 --> 01:38:37.133
<v Joshua Gay:>that have their own contemporary histories and

2004
01:38:37.554 --> 01:38:40.003
<v Joshua Gay:>approaches to doing global global collaboration and

2005
01:38:40.464 --> 01:38:41.507
<v Joshua Gay:>technology development.

2006
01:38:41.527 --> 01:38:43.191
<v Karen Herman:>That's fantastic.

2007
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:45.682
<v Karen Herman:>It sounds like everything just really came

2008
01:38:45.722 --> 01:38:46.163
<v Karen Herman:>together.

2009
01:38:46.503 --> 01:38:48.007
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, and I feel really lucky.

2010
01:38:49.009 --> 01:38:51.473
<v Joshua Gay:>And I should say when that job

2011
01:38:51.534 --> 01:38:55.286
<v Joshua Gay:>came up, it ended up, it came

2012
01:38:55.326 --> 01:38:58.393
<v Joshua Gay:>to me, but three people had recommended

2013
01:38:58.413 --> 01:39:01.943
<v Joshua Gay:>to the hiring manager, me, and they

2014
01:39:01.964 --> 01:39:04.490
<v Joshua Gay:>had sent, other people had sent me

2015
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:05.392
<v Joshua Gay:>the job description.

2016
01:39:05.432 --> 01:39:12.526
<v Joshua Gay:>It was that community that I've been

2017
01:39:12.686 --> 01:39:18.854
<v Joshua Gay:>pouring myself into, whether it was part

2018
01:39:18.874 --> 01:39:21.519
<v Joshua Gay:>of my day job or just part

2019
01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.245
<v Joshua Gay:>of one of my many different volunteer

2020
01:39:24.265 --> 01:39:28.272
<v Joshua Gay:>jobs, they were there for me.

2021
01:39:28.573 --> 01:39:31.943
<v Joshua Gay:>And that felt really great because I'm

2022
01:39:32.604 --> 01:39:34.988
<v Joshua Gay:>usually just a person who's saying, how

2023
01:39:35.008 --> 01:39:35.469
<v Joshua Gay:>can I help?

2024
01:39:36.972 --> 01:39:39.376
<v Joshua Gay:>And then when I needed help and

2025
01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:42.706
<v Joshua Gay:>then something like this, to know that

2026
01:39:43.849 --> 01:39:45.693
<v Joshua Gay:>people thought of me and that I

2027
01:39:45.733 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Joshua Gay:>was a part of that and that

2028
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.362
<v Joshua Gay:>I was a good fit for this

2029
01:39:48.402 --> 01:39:50.086
<v Joshua Gay:>kind of, potentially a good fit for

2030
01:39:50.106 --> 01:39:55.581
<v Joshua Gay:>this kind of work, that's really meaningful.

2031
01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:57.305
<v Joshua Gay:>It really carries me day to day,

2032
01:39:57.405 --> 01:39:59.932
<v Joshua Gay:>knowing that even if we're not always

2033
01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:03.826
<v Joshua Gay:>communicating or staying in touch, that there's

2034
01:40:03.886 --> 01:40:07.133
<v Joshua Gay:>enough people out there that view the

2035
01:40:07.153 --> 01:40:10.785
<v Joshua Gay:>importance of this network of being there

2036
01:40:10.805 --> 01:40:12.267
<v Joshua Gay:>for each other, thinking of each other,

2037
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:17.081
<v Joshua Gay:>making sure that we aren't just necessarily

2038
01:40:17.121 --> 01:40:19.065
<v Joshua Gay:>getting a job, but we're able to

2039
01:40:20.468 --> 01:40:22.312
<v Joshua Gay:>try to have the impact in the

2040
01:40:22.352 --> 01:40:24.702
<v Joshua Gay:>ways we want to be able to

2041
01:40:24.842 --> 01:40:27.048
<v Joshua Gay:>hear the things that I'm maybe pretty

2042
01:40:27.088 --> 01:40:28.712
<v Joshua Gay:>good at or that I have experience

2043
01:40:28.752 --> 01:40:29.153
<v Joshua Gay:>doing.

2044
01:40:29.234 --> 01:40:30.281
<v Joshua Gay:>How could these be useful?

2045
01:40:31.144 --> 01:40:33.188
<v Joshua Gay:>And that there's a lot of people

2046
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:34.372
<v Joshua Gay:>out there in the free and open

2047
01:40:34.392 --> 01:40:37.765
<v Joshua Gay:>source software world that really get that.

2048
01:40:38.146 --> 01:40:39.909
<v Joshua Gay:>And they're like, "oh yeah, I get

2049
01:40:39.949 --> 01:40:40.009
<v Joshua Gay:>it.

2050
01:40:41.112 --> 01:40:42.974
<v Joshua Gay:>You've done these things." "That'd be great.

2051
01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.043
<v Joshua Gay:>You could help do these other things

2052
01:40:45.083 --> 01:40:47.756
<v Joshua Gay:>really well." "That would be so awesome."

2053
01:40:47.869 --> 01:40:53.544
<v Joshua Gay:>And those kinds of helping us, whether

2054
01:40:53.604 --> 01:40:55.908
<v Joshua Gay:>it's on our careers or to get

2055
01:40:55.968 --> 01:40:57.571
<v Joshua Gay:>projects off the ground or to go

2056
01:40:57.592 --> 01:41:02.866
<v Joshua Gay:>and spend time even volunteering or supporting

2057
01:41:03.347 --> 01:41:04.771
<v Joshua Gay:>one way or another each other's work,

2058
01:41:06.454 --> 01:41:11.892
<v Joshua Gay:>really feels, it's just indescribable community, the

2059
01:41:11.952 --> 01:41:12.994
<v Joshua Gay:>free and open source software.

2060
01:41:13.561 --> 01:41:16.850
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah, the community aspect just is huge.

2061
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:17.952
<v Karen Herman:>That's so much a part of it.

2062
01:41:18.213 --> 01:41:20.001
<v Karen Herman:>I want to ask you, how do

2063
01:41:20.023 --> 01:41:24.992
<v Karen Herman:>you think the community has changed since

2064
01:41:25.013 --> 01:41:25.915
<v Karen Herman:>you first got into it?

2065
01:41:29.142 --> 01:41:31.365
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, so I would say maybe the

2066
01:41:31.505 --> 01:41:37.171
<v Joshua Gay:>biggest change is in the first 10,

2067
01:41:38.774 --> 01:41:41.037
<v Joshua Gay:>maybe almost 15 years that I was

2068
01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:43.264
<v Joshua Gay:>a part of it, I couldn't really

2069
01:41:43.344 --> 01:41:45.489
<v Joshua Gay:>go more than a week or two

2070
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:51.364
<v Joshua Gay:>without having a conversation about questioning the

2071
01:41:51.444 --> 01:41:54.289
<v Joshua Gay:>legitimacy of it at a very fundamental

2072
01:41:54.329 --> 01:41:55.692
<v Joshua Gay:>level.

2073
01:41:56.233 --> 01:41:58.340
<v Joshua Gay:>But asking, well, how do you pay

2074
01:41:58.401 --> 01:41:58.721
<v Joshua Gay:>for it?

2075
01:41:58.842 --> 01:42:00.626
<v Joshua Gay:>Or how can a business do that?

2076
01:42:00.726 --> 01:42:02.170
<v Joshua Gay:>Or why should they give this all

2077
01:42:02.210 --> 01:42:02.550
<v Joshua Gay:>away?

2078
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:06.745
<v Joshua Gay:>Or just very fundamental questions were constantly

2079
01:42:07.507 --> 01:42:10.413
<v Joshua Gay:>being asked by anybody I was interacting

2080
01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:13.864
<v Joshua Gay:>with, even people that were a part

2081
01:42:13.904 --> 01:42:14.064
<v Joshua Gay:>of it.

2082
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:20.694
<v Joshua Gay:>And just feeling maybe not confident about

2083
01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:21.535
<v Joshua Gay:>it.

2084
01:42:22.116 --> 01:42:23.621
<v Joshua Gay:>They might be doing it, but it

2085
01:42:23.661 --> 01:42:26.468
<v Joshua Gay:>could feel so tenuous that like, could

2086
01:42:26.488 --> 01:42:27.349
<v Joshua Gay:>this just go on?

2087
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:29.915
<v Joshua Gay:>Is this ever going to be like,

2088
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.442
<v Joshua Gay:>how do we actually keep doing this?

2089
01:42:33.266 --> 01:42:37.853
<v Joshua Gay:>To now, where I don't necessarily think

2090
01:42:37.954 --> 01:42:43.968
<v Joshua Gay:>people are on the whole more informed

2091
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:45.351
<v Joshua Gay:>of what free and open source software

2092
01:42:45.411 --> 01:42:45.531
<v Joshua Gay:>is.

2093
01:42:46.473 --> 01:42:48.281
<v Joshua Gay:>But the legitimacy of it, that it's

2094
01:42:48.321 --> 01:42:52.049
<v Joshua Gay:>here, that it's established, is so strong

2095
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:54.575
<v Joshua Gay:>that when you start talking about it,

2096
01:42:55.341 --> 01:42:58.246
<v Joshua Gay:>they don't immediately go to questioning those

2097
01:42:58.306 --> 01:42:59.789
<v Joshua Gay:>fundamentals nearly as often.

2098
01:42:59.809 --> 01:43:05.883
<v Joshua Gay:>Now I have gone maybe two years

2099
01:43:06.183 --> 01:43:07.625
<v Joshua Gay:>almost, I would say, at this point.

2100
01:43:10.169 --> 01:43:15.217
<v Joshua Gay:>I can't recall a single question along

2101
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.504
<v Joshua Gay:>the lines which I used to get,

2102
01:43:16.925 --> 01:43:18.269
<v Joshua Gay:>which would surprise me if I could

2103
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:21.164
<v Joshua Gay:>go more than two weeks without having

2104
01:43:21.204 --> 01:43:23.730
<v Joshua Gay:>that kind of conversation about how you

2105
01:43:23.791 --> 01:43:24.292
<v Joshua Gay:>pay for it.

2106
01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:25.415
<v Joshua Gay:>And we used to have to frame

2107
01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.122
<v Joshua Gay:>it that way, right?

2108
01:43:26.202 --> 01:43:28.467
<v Joshua Gay:>So we'd have to explain to people,

2109
01:43:28.487 --> 01:43:31.961
<v Joshua Gay:>we'd have little catchphrases and Free Software

2110
01:43:31.981 --> 01:43:33.947
<v Joshua Gay:>would say, no, no, it's free as

2111
01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.371
<v Joshua Gay:>in freedom, not as in beer.

2112
01:43:35.832 --> 01:43:37.503
<v Joshua Gay:>Now we don't have to explain what

2113
01:43:37.583 --> 01:43:39.246
<v Joshua Gay:>free and open source software is relative

2114
01:43:39.267 --> 01:43:41.753
<v Joshua Gay:>to other goods or that it's a

2115
01:43:41.793 --> 01:43:44.384
<v Joshua Gay:>matter of principle or other things.

2116
01:43:45.526 --> 01:43:49.174
<v Joshua Gay:>We can just talk about it and

2117
01:43:49.194 --> 01:43:52.424
<v Joshua Gay:>the fact that we're not, it's not

2118
01:43:53.286 --> 01:43:55.951
<v Joshua Gay:>constantly trying to commoditize it or profit

2119
01:43:55.991 --> 01:43:57.293
<v Joshua Gay:>off of it or control it.

2120
01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.887
<v Joshua Gay:>It's just sort of understood that it

2121
01:44:01.927 --> 01:44:04.112
<v Joshua Gay:>works in the same realm as Wikipedia

2122
01:44:04.153 --> 01:44:06.383
<v Joshua Gay:>and other things that people value and

2123
01:44:06.423 --> 01:44:07.004
<v Joshua Gay:>appreciate.

2124
01:44:08.929 --> 01:44:09.991
<v Joshua Gay:>To me, that's the biggest difference.

2125
01:44:10.031 --> 01:44:12.380
<v Joshua Gay:>And that's where I think us seeing

2126
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:15.948
<v Joshua Gay:>the next phase of what does this

2127
01:44:15.988 --> 01:44:17.191
<v Joshua Gay:>mean now for the world?

2128
01:44:17.632 --> 01:44:19.696
<v Joshua Gay:>What can we do as people that

2129
01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.065
<v Joshua Gay:>want to be a part of strengthening

2130
01:44:22.165 --> 01:44:24.349
<v Joshua Gay:>the foundations of free and open source

2131
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:24.871
<v Joshua Gay:>software?

2132
01:44:25.493 --> 01:44:28.463
<v Joshua Gay:>I think it's a whole different set

2133
01:44:28.764 --> 01:44:32.371
<v Joshua Gay:>of strategies and tactics that we're able

2134
01:44:32.411 --> 01:44:33.954
<v Joshua Gay:>to now start to think of and

2135
01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:35.901
<v Joshua Gay:>to work at another level.

2136
01:44:36.622 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Joshua Gay:>And yeah, I really think we've hit

2137
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:44.516
<v Joshua Gay:>this next whole phase where we spent

2138
01:44:46.022 --> 01:44:49.810
<v Joshua Gay:>decades kind of maybe going through open

2139
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:51.834
<v Joshua Gay:>source 1.0 or something, and now we're

2140
01:44:51.894 --> 01:44:53.376
<v Joshua Gay:>on to open source 2.0.

2141
01:44:53.376 --> 01:44:56.827
<v Joshua Gay:>And that's not the original thing.

2142
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:58.992
<v Joshua Gay:>I can look to scholarly publications for

2143
01:44:59.033 --> 01:45:00.883
<v Joshua Gay:>business schools that are saying that.

2144
01:45:00.943 --> 01:45:02.607
<v Joshua Gay:>And there's citations about this and whole

2145
01:45:02.627 --> 01:45:07.844
<v Joshua Gay:>discussions from well-established scholars right now that

2146
01:45:07.884 --> 01:45:09.568
<v Joshua Gay:>are publishing using these ideas.

2147
01:45:09.889 --> 01:45:11.071
<v Joshua Gay:>And that's different.

2148
01:45:12.034 --> 01:45:13.642
<v Joshua Gay:>If you think about where I started

2149
01:45:14.283 --> 01:45:17.169
<v Joshua Gay:>and me looking for things to cite,

2150
01:45:18.692 --> 01:45:19.433
<v Joshua Gay:>what did I have?

2151
01:45:19.453 --> 01:45:20.575
<v Joshua Gay:>I had Next to Nothing.

2152
01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.087
<v Joshua Gay:>I had guru.org, some writings there, some

2153
01:45:24.348 --> 01:45:26.292
<v Joshua Gay:>initial things from Eric S.

2154
01:45:26.393 --> 01:45:28.301
<v Joshua Gay:>Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, which

2155
01:45:28.341 --> 01:45:30.846
<v Joshua Gay:>was actually hard to apply, even though

2156
01:45:31.547 --> 01:45:33.371
<v Joshua Gay:>there was some good ideas.

2157
01:45:35.955 --> 01:45:37.463
<v Joshua Gay:>It didn't directly tie to like an

2158
01:45:37.543 --> 01:45:39.347
<v Joshua Gay:>operating system that was in existence.

2159
01:45:39.848 --> 01:45:42.900
<v Joshua Gay:>It applied conceptually of why we might

2160
01:45:43.862 --> 01:45:45.887
<v Joshua Gay:>be able to have some arguments at

2161
01:45:45.907 --> 01:45:47.671
<v Joshua Gay:>a business level, but how do you

2162
01:45:47.731 --> 01:45:50.262
<v Joshua Gay:>point towards actual stuff and then make

2163
01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:50.923
<v Joshua Gay:>the argument?

2164
01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:52.908
<v Joshua Gay:>There was very little for me to

2165
01:45:52.948 --> 01:45:53.369
<v Joshua Gay:>work with.

2166
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:56.481
<v Joshua Gay:>And now, nowadays, you can come at

2167
01:45:56.541 --> 01:46:00.168
<v Joshua Gay:>it from sociologists who have published books

2168
01:46:00.289 --> 01:46:02.153
<v Joshua Gay:>or gotten tenure from it.

2169
01:46:02.994 --> 01:46:05.022
<v Joshua Gay:>You can come at it from anthropologists,

2170
01:46:06.084 --> 01:46:11.853
<v Joshua Gay:>people like Chris Kelty, who did free

2171
01:46:11.873 --> 01:46:14.236
<v Joshua Gay:>software and has gone on to sort

2172
01:46:14.276 --> 01:46:18.226
<v Joshua Gay:>of free science and type work.

2173
01:46:18.667 --> 01:46:22.112
<v Joshua Gay:>You can come at it from Yochai

2174
01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:24.256
<v Joshua Gay:>Benkler and sort of a legal and

2175
01:46:24.296 --> 01:46:29.770
<v Joshua Gay:>business school type approach and sort of

2176
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:32.114
<v Joshua Gay:>on and on across these different disciplines.

2177
01:46:32.235 --> 01:46:34.805
<v Joshua Gay:>Often, they're multi-discipline kind of areas of

2178
01:46:34.885 --> 01:46:37.894
<v Joshua Gay:>work that intersect between business and law

2179
01:46:38.014 --> 01:46:40.485
<v Joshua Gay:>and technology, but they are their own

2180
01:46:40.545 --> 01:46:43.512
<v Joshua Gay:>disciplines and they have their own conferences.

2181
01:46:43.973 --> 01:46:46.885
<v Joshua Gay:>They don't even always feel tied to

2182
01:46:47.065 --> 01:46:48.389
<v Joshua Gay:>using the language of free and open

2183
01:46:48.409 --> 01:46:49.050
<v Joshua Gay:>source software.

2184
01:46:49.472 --> 01:46:58.348
<v Joshua Gay:>They'll talk about open collaborative innovation projects,

2185
01:46:59.751 --> 01:47:00.592
<v Joshua Gay:>is the term, right?

2186
01:47:01.013 --> 01:47:03.436
<v Joshua Gay:>And the one strong example in their

2187
01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:06.286
<v Joshua Gay:>papers is, well, free and open source

2188
01:47:06.306 --> 01:47:09.833
<v Joshua Gay:>software is the best example.

2189
01:47:09.873 --> 01:47:11.420
<v Joshua Gay:>This is the purest example of this

2190
01:47:11.781 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Joshua Gay:>class of ways that people can encourage

2191
01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:20.296
<v Joshua Gay:>user innovation or work with communities and

2192
01:47:20.316 --> 01:47:22.162
<v Joshua Gay:>things like that.

2193
01:47:22.763 --> 01:47:24.686
<v Joshua Gay:>But that's really exciting to me.

2194
01:47:24.726 --> 01:47:29.133
<v Joshua Gay:>It's just a whole other set of

2195
01:47:30.295 --> 01:47:34.126
<v Joshua Gay:>interested parties coming at it, valuing it

2196
01:47:34.668 --> 01:47:35.570
<v Joshua Gay:>in their own ways.

2197
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.374
<v Joshua Gay:>To me, that is really important.

2198
01:47:37.414 --> 01:47:39.282
<v Joshua Gay:>We don't have to position ourselves against

2199
01:47:40.065 --> 01:47:41.327
<v Joshua Gay:>Eric S.

2200
01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:43.854
<v Joshua Gay:>Raymond or Richard Solomon or Florence Lessig

2201
01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:44.982
<v Joshua Gay:>or some of these other people.

2202
01:47:45.002 --> 01:47:47.448
<v Joshua Gay:>We can value their contribution and we

2203
01:47:47.488 --> 01:47:50.275
<v Joshua Gay:>can take the ideas, but we don't

2204
01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.724
<v Joshua Gay:>ground everything in those anymore.

2205
01:47:54.206 --> 01:47:59.494
<v Joshua Gay:>We have just a lot more happening

2206
01:47:59.535 --> 01:48:00.840
<v Joshua Gay:>and a lot more people coming at

2207
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:00.980
<v Joshua Gay:>it.

2208
01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:04.506
<v Joshua Gay:>That's important because we need to be

2209
01:48:04.546 --> 01:48:09.635
<v Joshua Gay:>able to understand, we need to be

2210
01:48:09.695 --> 01:48:11.644
<v Joshua Gay:>able to look at ourselves, look at

2211
01:48:11.684 --> 01:48:13.910
<v Joshua Gay:>the work we're doing, look at issues

2212
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:17.986
<v Joshua Gay:>of sustainability, look at are we going

2213
01:48:18.006 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Joshua Gay:>down a rut, are we blindsided, right?

2214
01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:23.042
<v Joshua Gay:>Are we focusing on certain problems as

2215
01:48:23.142 --> 01:48:25.650
<v Joshua Gay:>engineers, as collaborators, as people who want

2216
01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:27.862
<v Joshua Gay:>to build these just because they're the

2217
01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:29.585
<v Joshua Gay:>ones we've known how to do?

2218
01:48:30.107 --> 01:48:32.451
<v Joshua Gay:>Or are we also looking to tackle

2219
01:48:32.492 --> 01:48:34.422
<v Joshua Gay:>hard problems like climate change and other

2220
01:48:34.462 --> 01:48:34.723
<v Joshua Gay:>things?

2221
01:48:34.763 --> 01:48:36.287
<v Joshua Gay:>And I'm seeing a lot of people

2222
01:48:36.347 --> 01:48:37.972
<v Joshua Gay:>that I grew up with in the

2223
01:48:38.032 --> 01:48:43.168
<v Joshua Gay:>movement going from developing specific projects that

2224
01:48:43.528 --> 01:48:47.035
<v Joshua Gay:>were standards to focusing all of that

2225
01:48:47.155 --> 01:48:48.782
<v Joshua Gay:>and applying it to something like climate

2226
01:48:48.802 --> 01:48:51.447
<v Joshua Gay:>change, like Evan Pradromo, who helped create

2227
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:54.861
<v Joshua Gay:>StatusNet and did a lot of early

2228
01:48:55.783 --> 01:48:58.189
<v Joshua Gay:>federated social networking things.

2229
01:48:58.249 --> 01:49:00.013
<v Joshua Gay:>The whole idea that we have mastered

2230
01:49:00.113 --> 01:49:03.544
<v Joshua Gay:>on today, which is the distributed competitor

2231
01:49:03.584 --> 01:49:09.215
<v Joshua Gay:>to Twitter, is because of having standards

2232
01:49:09.275 --> 01:49:14.907
<v Joshua Gay:>that Evan was the chair of through

2233
01:49:14.927 --> 01:49:15.728
<v Joshua Gay:>the W3C.

2234
01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:19.654
<v Joshua Gay:>A lot of that work came out

2235
01:49:19.734 --> 01:49:22.320
<v Joshua Gay:>of, I remember being at the Free

2236
01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:29.052
<v Joshua Gay:>Software Foundation when the day before Liberty

2237
01:49:29.072 --> 01:49:32.342
<v Joshua Gay:>Planet, the conference that I helped create,

2238
01:49:32.903 --> 01:49:36.851
<v Joshua Gay:>they had a separate meeting and they

2239
01:49:36.911 --> 01:49:43.384
<v Joshua Gay:>signed this Franklin Street statement on the

2240
01:49:43.425 --> 01:49:47.633
<v Joshua Gay:>freedom of network services declaration and this

2241
01:49:47.673 --> 01:49:49.156
<v Joshua Gay:>idea of moving towards federated.

2242
01:49:50.101 --> 01:49:57.991
<v Joshua Gay:>But it was so entangled in issues

2243
01:49:58.012 --> 01:50:00.355
<v Joshua Gay:>that so few people even could recognize

2244
01:50:00.415 --> 01:50:00.955
<v Joshua Gay:>as mattering.

2245
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.542
<v Joshua Gay:>And now I can talk about it

2246
01:50:02.602 --> 01:50:06.250
<v Joshua Gay:>in terms of, oh, people are mad

2247
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:09.599
<v Joshua Gay:>at Elon Musk for politics and things

2248
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:14.270
<v Joshua Gay:>that everybody, very large audiences understand.

2249
01:50:14.771 --> 01:50:18.161
<v Joshua Gay:>And they're creating Bastidon and these tools

2250
01:50:18.402 --> 01:50:20.786
<v Joshua Gay:>and that just be apps that people

2251
01:50:20.826 --> 01:50:24.533
<v Joshua Gay:>have on there that don't take a

2252
01:50:24.573 --> 01:50:27.162
<v Joshua Gay:>week to compile and install on your

2253
01:50:27.683 --> 01:50:28.345
<v Joshua Gay:>laptop.

2254
01:50:28.906 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Joshua Gay:>You just put it on your phone

2255
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:33.315
<v Joshua Gay:>and you can start migrating.

2256
01:50:35.243 --> 01:50:37.107
<v Joshua Gay:>It's of real value and you immediately

2257
01:50:37.147 --> 01:50:40.493
<v Joshua Gay:>understand it, where it was so theoretic

2258
01:50:40.573 --> 01:50:44.544
<v Joshua Gay:>and so bogged out in technicalities and

2259
01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:47.248
<v Joshua Gay:>hard to even, you can envision it,

2260
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:52.760
<v Joshua Gay:>but you couldn't talk about it like

2261
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.442
<v Joshua Gay:>you can today.

2262
01:50:53.462 --> 01:50:56.168
<v Joshua Gay:>You can't give these real context.

2263
01:50:56.269 --> 01:50:57.331
<v Joshua Gay:>And now we do.

2264
01:50:57.351 --> 01:50:59.240
<v Joshua Gay:>And I think we're working at this

2265
01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.208
<v Joshua Gay:>next level of, okay, what do we

2266
01:51:03.228 --> 01:51:03.929
<v Joshua Gay:>do now?

2267
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:06.214
<v Joshua Gay:>How do we help continue to build

2268
01:51:06.314 --> 01:51:07.761
<v Joshua Gay:>on this and take the good and

2269
01:51:08.102 --> 01:51:09.526
<v Joshua Gay:>how do we get better at doing

2270
01:51:09.586 --> 01:51:10.227
<v Joshua Gay:>it ourselves?

2271
01:51:10.869 --> 01:51:11.070
<v Karen Herman:>Wow.

2272
01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:12.674
<v Karen Herman:>That's the perfect way to end.

2273
01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.844
<v Karen Herman:>We are at time.

2274
01:51:14.885 --> 01:51:15.807
<v Karen Herman:>I don't know if you have one

2275
01:51:15.987 --> 01:51:17.972
<v Karen Herman:>more minute for one more question.

2276
01:51:18.012 --> 01:51:18.794
<v Joshua Gay:>Yeah, yeah.

2277
01:51:18.914 --> 01:51:19.821
<v Joshua Gay:>I have a few minutes to wrap

2278
01:51:19.862 --> 01:51:20.583
<v Joshua Gay:>up here.

2279
01:51:20.684 --> 01:51:22.608
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

2280
01:51:22.728 --> 01:51:24.272
<v Karen Herman:>It's a very general question, but I

2281
01:51:24.332 --> 01:51:25.214
<v Karen Herman:>think it applies.

2282
01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.608
<v Karen Herman:>If your great-great-grandchild were to stumble on

2283
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:30.701
<v Karen Herman:>this recording 100 years from now, what

2284
01:51:30.741 --> 01:51:31.665
<v Karen Herman:>would you want them to know?

2285
01:51:31.685 --> 01:51:32.831
<v Karen Herman:>What would you say to them?

2286
01:51:37.482 --> 01:51:43.429
<v Joshua Gay:>That 100 years ago, before where I

2287
01:51:43.529 --> 01:51:49.255
<v Joshua Gay:>am now, there were engineers and visionaries

2288
01:51:49.516 --> 01:51:53.927
<v Joshua Gay:>and artists coming together, solving hard problems

2289
01:51:54.027 --> 01:51:58.175
<v Joshua Gay:>like electrifying the nation with electric lines

2290
01:51:58.235 --> 01:52:01.429
<v Joshua Gay:>and building radio and they were having

2291
01:52:01.530 --> 01:52:07.425
<v Joshua Gay:>geeky dinners through the Morse Society where

2292
01:52:07.446 --> 01:52:09.429
<v Joshua Gay:>the whole dinner menu is in Morse

2293
01:52:09.490 --> 01:52:12.596
<v Joshua Gay:>code and making jokes and all of

2294
01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:18.526
<v Joshua Gay:>the types of support systems were necessary

2295
01:52:18.627 --> 01:52:20.208
<v Joshua Gay:>back then that are here now, that

2296
01:52:20.228 --> 01:52:29.223
<v Joshua Gay:>large numbers of people in those communities

2297
01:52:29.263 --> 01:52:31.888
<v Joshua Gay:>were not neurotypical, that they had all

2298
01:52:31.908 --> 01:52:35.827
<v Joshua Gay:>of the same challenges that people today,

2299
01:52:35.827 --> 01:52:39.187
<v Joshua Gay:>100 years later, are having and are

2300
01:52:39.989 --> 01:52:43.315
<v Joshua Gay:>able to bring together this idea that,

2301
01:52:43.776 --> 01:52:47.649
<v Joshua Gay:>yes, there's engineering, yes, there's corporations, but

2302
