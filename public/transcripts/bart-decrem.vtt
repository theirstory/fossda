<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

3
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.230
<v Karen Herman:>I'm just going to do a slate

4
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.560
<v Karen Herman:>first.

5
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.970
<v Karen Herman:>Today is November 1st in the year

6
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.899
<v Karen Herman:>2024.

7
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Karen Herman:>I'm Karen Herman, and I'm conducting an

8
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Karen Herman:>interview with Bart Decrem for the Free

9
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Karen Herman:>and Open Source Stories Digital Archive Foundation.

10
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.409
<v Bart Decrem:>It's all a lie.

11
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.119
<v Bart Decrem:>I can't believe you're starting off with

12
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Bart Decrem:>a bunch of lies.

13
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Karen Herman:>Okay, so.

14
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Bart Decrem:>It's 1994 people.

15
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.100
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, we'll fix it in post.

16
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.549
<v Karen Herman:>Um, um, so we're going to start

17
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Karen Herman:>right from the very beginning.

18
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.669
<v Karen Herman:>Where and when were you born?

19
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, 1967 Belgium.

20
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

21
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Karen Herman:>It was a tough year.

22
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it might have been even

23
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Bart Decrem:>Purple Haze.

24
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.629
<v Karen Herman:>Might have been.

25
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.769
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm not 100% sure of that.

26
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Karen Herman:>So what was your.

27
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Karen Herman:>What kind of kid were you?

28
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, I was, I was, I was

29
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Bart Decrem:>a fiddler always, you know, nerding out

30
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.839
<v Bart Decrem:>and then and then there weren't really

31
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Bart Decrem:>laptops yet to nerd out with.

32
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Bart Decrem:>um, so my first, you know, sort

33
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Bart Decrem:>of earning my stripes, um, in a

34
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Bart Decrem:>recognizable manner was when I was 13,

35
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Bart Decrem:>I started hanging out around the it

36
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Bart Decrem:>was pirate radio at that time back

37
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Bart Decrem:>in Europe.

38
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a really fun documentary on it.

39
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't know if it's a documentary

40
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Bart Decrem:>movie about sort of the roots of

41
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Bart Decrem:>pirate radio in England and the ships

42
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Bart Decrem:>on the North Sea and all that.

43
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.119
<v Bart Decrem:>After that sort of, sort of it's

44
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Bart Decrem:>we're right there after we're in the

45
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Bart Decrem:>middle of the punk wave.

46
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and, and so independent radio, it

47
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Bart Decrem:>was only government run radio at the

48
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Bart Decrem:>time.

49
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Bart Decrem:>We had independent illegal radio.

50
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Bart Decrem:>You'd get shut down by the authorities,

51
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Bart Decrem:>the telecommunication oversight bodies, like they would

52
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Bart Decrem:>literally come in, pound the antennas and

53
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Bart Decrem:>the transmitters.

54
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Bart Decrem:>When I was 13, I started volunteering

55
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Bart Decrem:>there and I made a little magazine,

56
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, compiling their Billboard chart and,

57
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Bart Decrem:>and then and then and then that

58
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Bart Decrem:>led to me being doing on air,

59
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Bart Decrem:>um, shows on, on, on, on underground

60
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Bart Decrem:>radio when I was 13, 14, 15.

61
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.449
<v Karen Herman:>What attracted you to that?

62
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, well, I've always liked tinkering and

63
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Bart Decrem:>starting stuff and sort of entrepreneuring sort

64
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Bart Decrem:>of like basement entrepreneur, you know, garage

65
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Bart Decrem:>entrepreneurship.

66
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Bart Decrem:>And I've always I've always wanted to

67
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Bart Decrem:>be on the pirate ship, you know,

68
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Bart Decrem:>with the rebels.

69
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and the underdogs.

70
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that's sort of a through

71
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Bart Decrem:>line in my, in my career.

72
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like an aesthetic and cultural and

73
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.549
<v Bart Decrem:>philosophical political preference, you know.

74
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Karen Herman:>What about your family?

75
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Karen Herman:>Did your, um, were they were they

76
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Karen Herman:>okay with what you.

77
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, that's what it was.

78
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Bart Decrem:>It was just a reaction against my

79
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Bart Decrem:>parents, who were extremely middle class and

80
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Bart Decrem:>middle class values.

81
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.359
<v Bart Decrem:>My dad growing up first in his

82
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Bart Decrem:>village to to go to college and

83
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Bart Decrem:>having a very traditional, you know, sort

84
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of company life.

85
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, so I guess I was reacting

86
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Bart Decrem:>against that.

87
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

88
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Karen Herman:>So, how did you move to the

89
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Karen Herman:>United States?

90
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Bart Decrem:>I got kicked out of Catholic school

91
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Bart Decrem:>for being generally a troublemaker and ended

92
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.570
<v Bart Decrem:>up at an international school, the European

93
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.390
<v Bart Decrem:>School of Brussels, and really fell in

94
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.180
<v Bart Decrem:>love with the cosmopolitan vibes and being

95
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.310
<v Bart Decrem:>exposed to other languages and cultures and

96
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.850
<v Bart Decrem:>all that betrayed my people.

97
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Bart Decrem:>And as a Flemish kid went to

98
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.630
<v Bart Decrem:>the French university in Brussels, which is

99
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.769
<v Bart Decrem:>like, oh my God.

100
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, to study political science, because all

101
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Bart Decrem:>my friends moved back to their home

102
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.500
<v Bart Decrem:>countries all over Europe.

103
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.109
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I was eager to, uh,

104
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Bart Decrem:>to get out of Dodge and find

105
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.210
<v Bart Decrem:>another place I really enjoyed.

106
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.489
<v Bart Decrem:>I had gotten to visit California once

107
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.130
<v Bart Decrem:>on a free trip sponsored by Hawaiian

108
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Bart Decrem:>Airlines, which is a whole different cool

109
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Bart Decrem:>story.

110
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and really just I was

111
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.309
<v Bart Decrem:>like, oh, wow, I love the weather

112
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Bart Decrem:>and the vibes, as we now say,

113
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, and also, I was attracted to

114
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Bart Decrem:>the ethos of Silicon Valley and the

115
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Mac.

116
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.760
<v Bart Decrem:>The Macintosh had just come out, and

117
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.990
<v Bart Decrem:>that was the thing I typed all

118
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Bart Decrem:>my college papers on.

119
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I so on, if you

120
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.109
<v Bart Decrem:>want it to be part of that.

121
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I ended up, uh, doing

122
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Bart Decrem:>studying law at Stanford.

123
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Karen Herman:>So did you have one of the

124
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Karen Herman:>first Macintoshes?

125
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I did not, but to the

126
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Flemish University in Brussels.

127
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.850
<v Bart Decrem:>They had a whole lab with, uh,

128
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.010
<v Bart Decrem:>I think there was a mac 512

129
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Bart Decrem:>at the time.

130
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.040
<v Bart Decrem:>Later on, I did a community work

131
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Bart Decrem:>in East Palo Alto and a guy

132
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Bart Decrem:>named Andy Hertzfeld, who I have a

133
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Bart Decrem:>feeling we'll talk about more, um, was

134
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Bart Decrem:>one of our first supporters, and he

135
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Bart Decrem:>literally dropped off one of each model.

136
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.440
<v Bart Decrem:>So I think we had like a

137
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Bart Decrem:>macintosh 128 and a 512.

138
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think then they went to

139
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Bart Decrem:>the plus.

140
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.799
<v Bart Decrem:>And so you see the signatures on

141
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Bart Decrem:>the inside of the case, you know,

142
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.679
<v Bart Decrem:>signed by Steve and Andy and the

143
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Bart Decrem:>rest of the crew.

144
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, so, so that stuff is sort

145
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Bart Decrem:>of burned into my brain.

146
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

147
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

148
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.719
<v Karen Herman:>So what did you do once you

149
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Karen Herman:>got here?

150
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.490
<v Karen Herman:>What was your what was your plan?

151
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.369
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, my, my my plan was to

152
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Bart Decrem:>stay in school because I really enjoyed

153
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

154
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and enjoy the weather and and

155
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.229
<v Bart Decrem:>and I spent the summer at McKinsey

156
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.520
<v Bart Decrem:>doing management consulting, and, uh, I thought

157
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Bart Decrem:>I might want to be a diplomat

158
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Bart Decrem:>because I speak, like, six languages or

159
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.450
<v Bart Decrem:>something.

160
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.640
<v Bart Decrem:>And, and and still you learn so

161
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.599
<v Bart Decrem:>much about yourself, right?

162
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.220
<v Bart Decrem:>As soon as you sort of hit

163
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Bart Decrem:>the battlefield.

164
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Bart Decrem:>So I spent one summer doing professional

165
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Bart Decrem:>services in management consulting, and I really

166
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.729
<v Bart Decrem:>hated it.

167
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was this awful feeling where

168
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.729
<v Bart Decrem:>you go to work every day and

169
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Bart Decrem:>you're just like, this is not what

170
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm supposed to be doing.

171
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but I found what I was

172
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Bart Decrem:>supposed to be doing in East Palo

173
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.770
<v Bart Decrem:>Alto, which is, um, a low income

174
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Bart Decrem:>community right next to Stanford University.

175
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And I started living there and getting

176
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.780
<v Bart Decrem:>to know the kids and volunteering, and

177
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Bart Decrem:>I when I graduated, there was this

178
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Bart Decrem:>thing called Echoing Green Foundation, and they

179
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Bart Decrem:>were launching something at that time, completely

180
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.229
<v Bart Decrem:>new social entrepreneurship.

181
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, they were going to fancy universities

182
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Bart Decrem:>and, and giving fellowships to folks that

183
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Bart Decrem:>want to do community impact work.

184
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I spent five years building

185
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.409
<v Bart Decrem:>plugged In, helping to bridge the digital

186
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Bart Decrem:>divide between East Palo Alto and Silicon

187
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Valley.

188
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.970
<v Bart Decrem:>As an echoing green fellow.

189
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.599
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

190
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.920
<v Bart Decrem:>So I never, never took the bar.

191
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Never, never practice law.

192
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.419
<v Karen Herman:>Oh.

193
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.960
<v Karen Herman:>You didn't.

194
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.080
<v Karen Herman:>Oh.

195
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.890
<v Karen Herman:>That's interesting.

196
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.420
<v Karen Herman:>Talk a little bit about plugged In.

197
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.760
<v Karen Herman:>What exactly what exactly was it?

198
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so I was hanging out with

199
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.010
<v Bart Decrem:>a lot of community folks.

200
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.400
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, uh, and, and and black friends

201
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.230
<v Bart Decrem:>at Stanford and so on, and people

202
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.030
<v Bart Decrem:>are like, well, you know, if you

203
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.739
<v Bart Decrem:>you can't just talk about politics, you

204
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.730
<v Bart Decrem:>got to do something.

205
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Bart Decrem:>And so there was a church in,

206
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Bart Decrem:>in San Francisco called Glide Memorial Church

207
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.969
<v Bart Decrem:>that is still very well known.

208
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.260
<v Bart Decrem:>And they had a computer program.

209
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Bart Decrem:>It was called computers and you.

210
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.870
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, that's cool.

211
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.130
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm interested in computers and I want

212
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Bart Decrem:>to make a difference in the community.

213
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.320
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I went to the tenderloin

214
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.690
<v Bart Decrem:>several times and did some volunteering.

215
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And then and then a local community

216
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.800
<v Bart Decrem:>worker was like, well, you know, there's

217
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.420
<v Bart Decrem:>kids in East Palo and in Menlo

218
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Park, and I started volunteering at a

219
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.300
<v Bart Decrem:>boys and girls club and really believed

220
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Bart Decrem:>in the potential of computers to help

221
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.060
<v Bart Decrem:>improve people's lives.

222
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.270
<v Bart Decrem:>I've never really lost that irrational optimism,

223
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.310
<v Bart Decrem:>often irrational optimism.

224
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.669
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so when we launched Plugged

225
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.060
<v Bart Decrem:>In, it was, how can we bring

226
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.760
<v Bart Decrem:>technology to folks that don't have access

227
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Bart Decrem:>to them in a meaningful way?

228
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.310
<v Bart Decrem:>And so for kids early on especially,

229
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.450
<v Bart Decrem:>that meant sort of, you know, like

230
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.250
<v Bart Decrem:>math apps and stuff, sort of like

231
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.289
<v Bart Decrem:>the 1990s version of Duolingo.

232
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.359
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but very quickly we moved to

233
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.280
<v Bart Decrem:>storytelling, you know, like, hey, let's use

234
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.080
<v Bart Decrem:>these tools to make drawings and record

235
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.390
<v Bart Decrem:>audio and video and tell stories.

236
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.770
<v Bart Decrem:>And that, you know, that sort of

237
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.840
<v Bart Decrem:>felt more interesting very quickly to myself

238
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Bart Decrem:>and the other folks for teenagers.

239
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.520
<v Bart Decrem:>A guy named Louis Rossetto had just

240
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Bart Decrem:>launched a magazine called The Wired, and

241
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Bart Decrem:>the phone rang one day.

242
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Bart Decrem:>And he was he was like, hey,

243
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Bart Decrem:>how can we help you?

244
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Bart Decrem:>We'll run an ad for your thing.

245
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we're like, well, what's the

246
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Bart Decrem:>ad going to be for?

247
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Bart Decrem:>What's the call to action?

248
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.289
<v Bart Decrem:>And we started a teen run web

249
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.960
<v Bart Decrem:>design business where kids were building websites

250
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Bart Decrem:>for folks that were reading wired magazine,

251
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Bart Decrem:>and that worked out really well.

252
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Bart Decrem:>And then for adults, it ended up

253
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Bart Decrem:>being, here's a Kinko's.

254
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.600
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, you can come in here

255
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Bart Decrem:>and look for jobs and type up

256
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Bart Decrem:>your resume and do what you need

257
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Bart Decrem:>to do.

258
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was sort of a drop

259
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Bart Decrem:>in facility.

260
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.010
<v Bart Decrem:>So it was a number of ways

261
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.330
<v Bart Decrem:>of looking at how can we have

262
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.100
<v Bart Decrem:>the internet and computers.

263
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.680
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, how can we provide meaningful access

264
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.900
<v Bart Decrem:>that, that that helps people achieve their

265
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Bart Decrem:>goals in life?

266
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.090
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah, this is pretty early on.

267
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Karen Herman:>This is like 1999, 2000.

268
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.380
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah, 1992, 1999.

269
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Bart Decrem:>Right there when the internet was happening

270
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.460
<v Bart Decrem:>and mosaic came out and I remember,

271
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, Hotmail coming out and Hotmail

272
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Bart Decrem:>founder coming by to do a piece

273
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.419
<v Bart Decrem:>on how having email on a web

274
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Bart Decrem:>browser was amazing.

275
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.000
<v Bart Decrem:>It would change everybody's life and all

276
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.630
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

277
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Karen Herman:>And how do you think your experience

278
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.530
<v Karen Herman:>with Plugged In influenced the rest of

279
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Karen Herman:>your career choices as you were moving

280
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Karen Herman:>forward because you had a law degree

281
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Karen Herman:>and now.

282
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it got me to focus

283
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.580
<v Bart Decrem:>on doing something, and it got me

284
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.610
<v Bart Decrem:>to focus on the sort of belief

285
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.480
<v Bart Decrem:>that, you know, like you wake up

286
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.890
<v Bart Decrem:>in the morning and you read TechCrunch,

287
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Bart Decrem:>or maybe now it's The Verge, right?

288
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.310
<v Bart Decrem:>And you're excited about the new technology

289
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Bart Decrem:>and you believe it can build a

290
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.470
<v Bart Decrem:>better world.

291
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.910
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, what are you going to do

292
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.270
<v Bart Decrem:>about it?

293
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.740
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, or you wake up anxious

294
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.150
<v Bart Decrem:>about the election and oh my God,

295
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Trump might win.

296
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, what are you going to do

297
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.700
<v Bart Decrem:>today?

298
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.770
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it got me into that

299
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Bart Decrem:>mindset of don't just like something, you

300
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.140
<v Bart Decrem:>like something and then do something.

301
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so, um, I've always believed

302
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.230
<v Bart Decrem:>in the positive potential of technology, and

303
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't think I've been completely blind

304
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Bart Decrem:>to the to the risks and downsides.

305
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And so it's like a practice of

306
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.660
<v Bart Decrem:>like a through line in my career

307
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.910
<v Bart Decrem:>has been trying to practice that, trying

308
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.600
<v Bart Decrem:>to look for opportunities that technology can

309
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.400
<v Bart Decrem:>help improve folks lives?

310
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Um.

311
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.349
<v Bart Decrem:>Bring us together.

312
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, all of that.

313
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

314
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.380
<v Karen Herman:>And so.

315
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.000
<v Karen Herman:>So around that time, too, you also

316
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.320
<v Karen Herman:>co-founded easel.

317
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

318
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.050
<v Bart Decrem:>So, so so the next thing that

319
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Bart Decrem:>happened is our biggest contributor when we

320
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.720
<v Bart Decrem:>were doing Plugged In, was a guy

321
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.800
<v Bart Decrem:>that would just send a check every

322
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:02.979
<v Bart Decrem:>year.

323
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.640
<v Bart Decrem:>And I got to know him.

324
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Bart Decrem:>And his name was Andy Hertzfeld.

325
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Bart Decrem:>And he used a really interesting and

326
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.470
<v Bart Decrem:>colorful person and very well known in

327
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.870
<v Bart Decrem:>the area because he was part of

328
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.700
<v Bart Decrem:>the original band of Pirates with Steve

329
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.570
<v Bart Decrem:>Jobs.

330
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there's a famous, I believe it's

331
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Time magazine cover of the team that

332
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.719
<v Bart Decrem:>built the Macintosh with Steve and and

333
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.700
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy and a number of other folks,

334
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Bart Decrem:>and Andy had built much of the

335
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.950
<v Bart Decrem:>original operating system, the finder and other

336
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.260
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff around it for for the Mac.

337
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and he was a big fan

338
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Bart Decrem:>of what we were doing and supported

339
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.630
<v Bart Decrem:>us and brought in all these Macintoshes

340
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.370
<v Bart Decrem:>for a little baby computer museum in

341
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.300
<v Bart Decrem:>the office.

342
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Um.

343
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.430
<v Bart Decrem:>And one day Andy.

344
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And then.

345
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I decided it was time

346
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Bart Decrem:>to move on.

347
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, that I had done my thing

348
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Bart Decrem:>there.

349
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Bart Decrem:>Guy named Avram Miller, who was head

350
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Bart Decrem:>of business development and corporate partnerships at

351
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Bart Decrem:>Intel, was like, hey, you've done all

352
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.089
<v Bart Decrem:>you can do here.

353
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Go do something else.

354
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.920
<v Bart Decrem:>He was right.

355
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.780
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I and I left and

356
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.880
<v Bart Decrem:>caught up with Andy Hertzfeld and said,

357
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Bart Decrem:>what should I do next?

358
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.570
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like, well, I've seen the

359
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Bart Decrem:>light.

360
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, what's the light?

361
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like, the light is software

362
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.329
<v Bart Decrem:>should be free.

363
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.250
<v Bart Decrem:>He didn't say it that extreme.

364
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.370
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but but, um, here's how

365
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.660
<v Bart Decrem:>we get into open source.

366
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.319
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy, after having built, uh, worked at

367
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.880
<v Bart Decrem:>Apple, um, built, uh, scanning software that

368
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.530
<v Bart Decrem:>would work with dot matrix printer.

369
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:26.859
<v Bart Decrem:>It would.

370
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.990
<v Bart Decrem:>It's this sort of miraculous software if

371
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.850
<v Bart Decrem:>you if you sort of transplant yourself

372
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.469
<v Bart Decrem:>back to 1990, where you have a

373
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.300
<v Bart Decrem:>dot matrix printer and all of a

374
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.670
<v Bart Decrem:>sudden it's a scanner, you know, mind

375
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.959
<v Bart Decrem:>blown, which it still is.

376
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Bart Decrem:>That's still like an incredible trick.

377
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.290
<v Bart Decrem:>I still can't quite explain how that

378
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.209
<v Bart Decrem:>would work, but he built that because

379
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.890
<v Bart Decrem:>that's the kind of guy Andy is

380
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.080
<v Bart Decrem:>and made a livelihood as an indie.

381
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Now we call him an indie dev.

382
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and was making money selling his

383
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.370
<v Bart Decrem:>software.

384
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Bart Decrem:>$20, you know, a pop.

385
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Bart Decrem:>And a guy named Richard Stallman came

386
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Bart Decrem:>knocking on his door one day, as

387
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy told me the story and said,

388
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.079
<v Bart Decrem:>you need to set your software free.

389
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Bart Decrem:>It needs to be licensed under the

390
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Bart Decrem:>GPL.

391
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Bart Decrem:>And Andy said, what the hell is

392
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.829
<v Bart Decrem:>the GPL?

393
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.819
<v Bart Decrem:>And why would I want to do

394
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Bart Decrem:>it and get out of my house?

395
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm in publishing for, um, for color.

396
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Bart Decrem:>For color?

397
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but no.

398
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Bart Decrem:>Richard Stallman was trying to convince Andy

399
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Bart Decrem:>about the benefits of free software, and

400
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy was like, well, I'm making money

401
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Bart Decrem:>selling software.

402
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Bart Decrem:>That doesn't make sense.

403
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like, but but I got

404
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.849
<v Bart Decrem:>to realize that that Richard Stallman was

405
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Bart Decrem:>right.

406
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Bart Decrem:>And that specifically when it comes to

407
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.979
<v Bart Decrem:>the operating system and at the time,

408
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.969
<v Bart Decrem:>in the way that we've been talking

409
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Bart Decrem:>about Google and the other tech, you

410
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Bart Decrem:>know, Uh, tech powers.

411
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, at that time, you know, the

412
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Bart Decrem:>big one by far was Microsoft.

413
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Bart Decrem:>And they were really our gateway to

414
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.350
<v Bart Decrem:>all of computer technology and the internet.

415
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.569
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, until we get to Firefox.

416
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and Andy was like, this

417
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.410
<v Bart Decrem:>is gatekeeper technology for the entire planet,

418
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.209
<v Bart Decrem:>and this should be part of the

419
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.800
<v Bart Decrem:>commons in the way that, you know,

420
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Bart Decrem:>the phone system is, is a utility.

421
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and there's rules around, you know,

422
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.520
<v Bart Decrem:>keeping that open to all.

423
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Andy was convinced that the

424
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.140
<v Bart Decrem:>operating system should not be controlled, you

425
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.910
<v Bart Decrem:>know, as a gateway to the world

426
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Bart Decrem:>of computers.

427
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.770
<v Bart Decrem:>And the internet should not be controlled

428
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.640
<v Bart Decrem:>by one company.

429
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.220
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's the argument for, for Linux

430
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.100
<v Bart Decrem:>and the GPL, uh, open sourcing of

431
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.760
<v Bart Decrem:>Linux.

432
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Andy was like, I've seen

433
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.650
<v Bart Decrem:>the light.

434
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Software should be free, at least the

435
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.900
<v Bart Decrem:>operating system.

436
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And there needs to be an alternative

437
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.390
<v Bart Decrem:>to windows.

438
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And it exists.

439
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.819
<v Bart Decrem:>It's called Linux, but it needs to

440
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.080
<v Bart Decrem:>be made user friendly.

441
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.150
<v Bart Decrem:>And so, uh, let's go start a

442
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Bart Decrem:>company, Bart.

443
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.910
<v Bart Decrem:>And we started a company called easel

444
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.060
<v Bart Decrem:>that set out to make Linux user

445
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Bart Decrem:>friendly.

446
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:42.590
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

447
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.300
<v Karen Herman:>And what was your role in that?

448
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.380
<v Bart Decrem:>I was the junior founder, errands boy.

449
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, running around.

450
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.630
<v Bart Decrem:>It was my first startup.

451
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.800
<v Bart Decrem:>I'd never done anything.

452
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.540
<v Bart Decrem:>And with Andy.

453
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.970
<v Bart Decrem:>So I wrote the business plan, which

454
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.010
<v Bart Decrem:>is just things that I was typing

455
00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.000
<v Bart Decrem:>for three weeks.

456
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.410
<v Bart Decrem:>But really, what happens when you do

457
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.459
<v Bart Decrem:>a startup is you have a big

458
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.740
<v Bart Decrem:>idea and then you build energy around

459
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Bart Decrem:>it.

460
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.209
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the business plan, I mean,

461
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.680
<v Bart Decrem:>it's good because it shows that somebody

462
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.970
<v Bart Decrem:>is doing, you know, Google searches on

463
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.330
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff.

464
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.290
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, I don't know if that

465
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.400
<v Bart Decrem:>was a thing back then.

466
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Bart Decrem:>It was actually because it was 1999.

467
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.589
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but, but, but my role was

468
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Bart Decrem:>to run around and be sort of

469
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.750
<v Bart Decrem:>a source of energy.

470
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.520
<v Bart Decrem:>But very early on, a guy named

471
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Mike Homer, uh, got excited, and he

472
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.290
<v Bart Decrem:>had run all of business affairs for

473
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Netscape and had had sort of done

474
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.689
<v Bart Decrem:>the trench warfare with Microsoft over Internet

475
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.640
<v Bart Decrem:>Explorer and Netscape.

476
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.110
<v Bart Decrem:>And he was he got involved like

477
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.390
<v Bart Decrem:>a co-founder really, and board chair.

478
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Bart Decrem:>And he was fantastic.

479
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Mike Boyd had coined the term evangelist.

480
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, uh, hired Guy Kawasaki into Apple

481
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.650
<v Bart Decrem:>and he became the Mike became the

482
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.340
<v Bart Decrem:>CEO.

483
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.080
<v Bart Decrem:>So I was like the random guy

484
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.280
<v Bart Decrem:>that didn't know anything but had a

485
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.300
<v Bart Decrem:>lot of energy.

486
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.969
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, um, the team that we

487
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Bart Decrem:>built, Excel, Mitch Kapor, ended up on

488
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Bart Decrem:>our, on our board of directors.

489
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Bart Decrem:>So that takes us back to Mozilla

490
00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Bart Decrem:>as well.

491
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, and the team we assembled

492
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Bart Decrem:>was to this day, it was it

493
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Bart Decrem:>was really an exceptional team.

494
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, the the folks that we worked

495
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Bart Decrem:>with did all kinds of things, but

496
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Bart Decrem:>they went on and built much of

497
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Bart Decrem:>the iPhone, uh, operating software.

498
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, much of Safari was built by

499
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Bart Decrem:>folks from easel.

500
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, much of Passkeys, which is one

501
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.109
<v Bart Decrem:>of my very favorite technologies right now,

502
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.449
<v Bart Decrem:>was built by under under Darren Adler,

503
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Bart Decrem:>who was our, uh, lead engineer at

504
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Eazel.

505
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Bart Decrem:>He was an amazing team, in particular

506
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Bart Decrem:>on the engineering side.

507
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, and then there was also a

508
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Bart Decrem:>tribble was also involved.

509
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Bart Decrem:>And Bud had been the co-founder of

510
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Bart Decrem:>next, uh, with Steve Jobs.

511
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And so, so Andy and Bud would

512
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Bart Decrem:>sit around the office telling war stories

513
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Bart Decrem:>with with Susan Kerr, and every now

514
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Bart Decrem:>and then Arlo Rose and they'd be

515
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Bart Decrem:>telling all these Steve Jobs stories.

516
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.449
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there's a website called Folklore.org, uh,

517
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.699
<v Bart Decrem:>run by Andy that tells that captures

518
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Bart Decrem:>a lot of stories of the early

519
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Bart Decrem:>days of Apple in particular.

520
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Karen Herman:>That's great.

521
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Karen Herman:>So so, you know, you're working with

522
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.719
<v Karen Herman:>a not an open source, um, business

523
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Karen Herman:>plan.

524
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Karen Herman:>How how are you looking to create

525
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.699
<v Karen Herman:>a business out of it in terms

526
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Karen Herman:>of money making?

527
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, it was sort of the same.

528
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Bart Decrem:>Keep it.

529
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Bart Decrem:>One of my fatal flaws is, I

530
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Bart Decrem:>mean, I'm smart enough, but but I

531
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Bart Decrem:>tend to use that to overthink stuff.

532
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, one of the, one of the

533
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Bart Decrem:>things that one of the professional, uh,

534
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Bart Decrem:>impediments that you might develop as a

535
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.550
<v Bart Decrem:>with a law degree is that you

536
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of see 14 arguments on each

537
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Bart Decrem:>side.

538
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.449
<v Bart Decrem:>And there's a counterargument to everything.

539
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Bart Decrem:>And it goes back and forth and

540
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Bart Decrem:>there's an intellectual curiosity and all that,

541
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, and seeing multiple sides.

542
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Bart Decrem:>I tend to make stuff way too

543
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Bart Decrem:>complicated.

544
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I found in my career,

545
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Bart Decrem:>let's say, most of the things that

546
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Bart Decrem:>I've worked on have failed.

547
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Bart Decrem:>The things that have not failed are

548
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Bart Decrem:>usually things where I just kept it

549
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Bart Decrem:>really simple, like meat and potatoes, like,

550
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Bart Decrem:>oh, I built a game called Tap

551
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.949
<v Bart Decrem:>Tap Revenge.

552
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.479
<v Bart Decrem:>It's Guitar Hero on the iPhone.

553
00:16:59.480 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Bart Decrem:>It's free.

554
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.189
<v Bart Decrem:>I mean, it's such a simple idea.

555
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, an angry alligator that bangs

556
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Bart Decrem:>on pipes.

557
00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Bart Decrem:>A billion users for where's My water

558
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Bart Decrem:>at, Disney?

559
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, the simple, simple idea for easel

560
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Bart Decrem:>was, um, there should be a free

561
00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.079
<v Bart Decrem:>alternative.

562
00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a thing called Linux.

563
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Let's make it easy to use.

564
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a billion people with computers.

565
00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:20.929
<v Bart Decrem:>That number, hopefully, is going to go

566
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.889
<v Bart Decrem:>up some more.

567
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.629
<v Bart Decrem:>When you're sitting there and you have

568
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Bart Decrem:>a piece of software that a billion

569
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Bart Decrem:>people use, you'll figure out a way

570
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.829
<v Bart Decrem:>to make money later, which is very

571
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Silicon Valley tech bro kind of thinking.

572
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.760
<v Bart Decrem:>It also has held up a lot

573
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.700
<v Bart Decrem:>over the history of of consumer technology.

574
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.810
<v Bart Decrem:>So if you would if you had

575
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.220
<v Bart Decrem:>asked me at the time, well, what

576
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.930
<v Bart Decrem:>does that mean specifically?

577
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.310
<v Bart Decrem:>I think we were thinking about two

578
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Bart Decrem:>things.

579
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.400
<v Bart Decrem:>We'll sell a subscription, you know, and

580
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.229
<v Bart Decrem:>downloads we the idea was that there

581
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.060
<v Bart Decrem:>would be like a software service that

582
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Bart Decrem:>you can subscribe to.

583
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And then the other big idea, um,

584
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Bart Decrem:>the web browser as a distribution platform

585
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Bart Decrem:>that if you have a browser with

586
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Bart Decrem:>millions of people on it, that's valuable

587
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Bart Decrem:>distribution space, you'll be able to monetize.

588
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we got to the specifics

589
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Bart Decrem:>of how that works with Firefox a

590
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Bart Decrem:>few years later.

591
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.129
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but those were the two

592
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas at the time.

593
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, you can have open software and

594
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.219
<v Bart Decrem:>there will be people competing with you,

595
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.409
<v Bart Decrem:>but hopefully you'll have better brand and

596
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.760
<v Bart Decrem:>and you'll be ahead of them in

597
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Bart Decrem:>time and you'll have great mindshare and

598
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.580
<v Bart Decrem:>team, uh, and so you'll be all

599
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:23.939
<v Bart Decrem:>right.

600
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.020
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, you might not be as

601
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Bart Decrem:>big as if you had monopoly power

602
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Bart Decrem:>on the software, but you have community

603
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Bart Decrem:>buy in and you'll benefit from other

604
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Bart Decrem:>folks contribution and so on and so

605
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Bart Decrem:>on.

606
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and also where the upstart.

607
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

608
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Bart Decrem:>If the if the if the if

609
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.840
<v Bart Decrem:>the if the incumbent is worth 100

610
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Bart Decrem:>billion, we'll settle for ten.

611
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:39.630
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

612
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Bart Decrem:>That kind of logic, uh, you know,

613
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.169
<v Bart Decrem:>is very valid when you're starting to

614
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Bart Decrem:>think.

615
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Bart Decrem:>So that's as far as we've gotten

616
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.720
<v Bart Decrem:>on the business plan.

617
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.699
<v Karen Herman:>And the business itself.

618
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Karen Herman:>How did it do?

619
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, terrible.

620
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.370
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, it turns out that, uh, making

621
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Linux easy to use is, uh, something

622
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Bart Decrem:>that we all chase and never achieve.

623
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, it is, and I've.

624
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Bart Decrem:>And I keep relearning this lesson, you

625
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Bart Decrem:>know, like I've been working in Mastodon.

626
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, it's easy to get something.

627
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Bart Decrem:>It's easy to take something to a

628
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.139
<v Bart Decrem:>usability and polish level that from a

629
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Bart Decrem:>safe distance, looks like you're almost there.

630
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Bart Decrem:>But the last mile is It's very,

631
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Bart Decrem:>very difficult.

632
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's like it's not ten x,

633
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.169
<v Bart Decrem:>it's like 100 x, you know?

634
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Bart Decrem:>That's where all the work is in

635
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.870
<v Bart Decrem:>the last mile.

636
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Bart Decrem:>And when you don't nail that last

637
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Bart Decrem:>mile, I can give you a demo

638
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.300
<v Bart Decrem:>and make you feel like you're working

639
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.670
<v Bart Decrem:>on something good, but when you're using

640
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Bart Decrem:>it, it doesn't do the right thing.

641
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Bart Decrem:>It's kind of like when you're in

642
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.489
<v Bart Decrem:>Chrome as your operating system, and then

643
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Bart Decrem:>you want to print and all of

644
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Bart Decrem:>a sudden there's no print button and

645
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Bart Decrem:>you're like, what?

646
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Bart Decrem:>What?

647
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Bart Decrem:>Just, you know, like there's no print

648
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Bart Decrem:>here.

649
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Bart Decrem:>This is insane, right?

650
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Those kinds of moments that you can

651
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.780
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of you don't think of as

652
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.830
<v Bart Decrem:>a big deal or they don't sort

653
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.180
<v Bart Decrem:>of hit you up front.

654
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it's very hard.

655
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it the, the, the ultimate version

656
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Bart Decrem:>of this is sort of the apple

657
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Bart Decrem:>conclusion of no, no, you got to

658
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Bart Decrem:>own the whole stack from the app,

659
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.419
<v Bart Decrem:>in your web browser, in the browser,

660
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Bart Decrem:>in the operating system, you know, and

661
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Bart Decrem:>the circuit board and the, you know,

662
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.560
<v Bart Decrem:>and the CPU, right, that, you know,

663
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.659
<v Bart Decrem:>um, but but certainly if you're like

664
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Bart Decrem:>all the way over here just shipping

665
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.020
<v Bart Decrem:>some binary you can get from Download.com

666
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.000
<v Bart Decrem:>and install this on your computer and

667
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.260
<v Bart Decrem:>reboot it and hope it still.

668
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Boots up and it'll work out.

669
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, that's not going to work.

670
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.770
<v Bart Decrem:>So making Linux easy to use is

671
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:33.700
<v Bart Decrem:>very hard.

672
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Open source has been quite bad at

673
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.750
<v Bart Decrem:>usability problems.

674
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Could it involve curation and saying no.

675
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.600
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and and having peculiar tastes and

676
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.610
<v Bart Decrem:>instincts for consumer behaviors, none of which

677
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.379
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of map very well against the

678
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.969
<v Bart Decrem:>superpowers of the open source community.

679
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.239
<v Bart Decrem:>Most open source communities, um, and and

680
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Bart Decrem:>so if you are going to do

681
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Bart Decrem:>that, the correct way to go about

682
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.399
<v Bart Decrem:>it is Chromebook is that I'm going

683
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Bart Decrem:>to sell you a laptop for $500

684
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Bart Decrem:>that's cheaper than the other one, and

685
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Bart Decrem:>you're living in the browser, and hopefully

686
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Bart Decrem:>you're not going to try to print

687
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.439
<v Bart Decrem:>too often.

688
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, that's the correct answer to making

689
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Linux easy to use, and bringing open

690
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Bart Decrem:>source software to and building an alternative

691
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Bart Decrem:>stack is you just have a $500

692
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.760
<v Bart Decrem:>device that you sell at, you know,

693
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Bart Decrem:>Best Buy at the time over the

694
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Bart Decrem:>internet.

695
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.919
<v Bart Decrem:>Now it has different capital requirements and

696
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.550
<v Bart Decrem:>so on and so on.

697
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a reason Google does that, right?

698
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Bart Decrem:>Not all startup.

699
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Karen Herman:>So did Eazel.

700
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Karen Herman:>Did it eventually.

701
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.179
<v Karen Herman:>What happened to it?

702
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Karen Herman:>Did it just.

703
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Karen Herman:>Oh it.

704
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Bart Decrem:>Failed.

705
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Bart Decrem:>It failed in the the oldest crash

706
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.669
<v Bart Decrem:>that that people saw the workplace, remember?

707
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, there was a.com crash of 1999,

708
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Bart Decrem:>2000.

709
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so what happened is we

710
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Bart Decrem:>got started in 1999 on Eazel built

711
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Bart Decrem:>a team.

712
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, people were excited about Linux.

713
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Bart Decrem:>There was an IPO of a company

714
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.939
<v Bart Decrem:>called Linux one, I believe it was

715
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Bart Decrem:>called, and so on.

716
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.659
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and then a year later, the

717
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Bart Decrem:>stock market crashed and Pets.com, you know,

718
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, went away and webvan and, and

719
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Bart Decrem:>and this speculative thing called Linux and

720
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Bart Decrem:>building an alternative.

721
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Bart Decrem:>And we'll figure out monetization later.

722
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Bart Decrem:>That's not that wasn't a really good

723
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.500
<v Bart Decrem:>pitch.

724
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, 12 months later.

725
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Bart Decrem:>So we were unable to secure follow,

726
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.240
<v Bart Decrem:>follow on funding.

727
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And the company went out of business.

728
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Except that Darren Adler Andy Capp, Cameron

729
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Bart Decrem:>on payroll for like a whole lot

730
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Bart Decrem:>of year out of his personal, uh,

731
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Bart Decrem:>donations.

732
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy Hertzfeld kept funding there and Adler.

733
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.750
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the Nautilus, the software that

734
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.209
<v Bart Decrem:>we built, kept being improved for at

735
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Bart Decrem:>least another year and then became a

736
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Bart Decrem:>stock part of the gnome, which is

737
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Bart Decrem:>one of the front ends for, for

738
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Bart Decrem:>Linux.

739
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.720
<v Bart Decrem:>So the work, the work, the code

740
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Bart Decrem:>lived on well beyond the company.

741
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Karen Herman:>And you and you were part of

742
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Karen Herman:>GNOME Foundation.

743
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

744
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Bart Decrem:>I created I was the person herding

745
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Bart Decrem:>cats at the Graham Foundation.

746
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Bart Decrem:>There was, I suspect it was Miguel

747
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Bart Decrem:>de Caza that he had been the

748
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Bart Decrem:>leader of the GNOME project.

749
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.169
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, he's still very actively involved in

750
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Bart Decrem:>open source and at Microsoft today.

751
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.700
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so I think Miguel started

752
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Bart Decrem:>it, uh, the leadership around the GNOME

753
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Foundation.

754
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.399
<v Bart Decrem:>And I said, how can I help?

755
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think one way or another,

756
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.879
<v Bart Decrem:>I was the person that sort of

757
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Bart Decrem:>helped, um, Come on, put a governance

758
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Bart Decrem:>model.

759
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think we created a 501,

760
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Bart Decrem:>C three, and so on and so

761
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Bart Decrem:>on.

762
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that it was it was

763
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Bart Decrem:>one of the earlier open source foundations.

764
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And so as you look at the

765
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Bart Decrem:>Mozilla Foundation and the Linux Foundation, there

766
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Bart Decrem:>were sort of the Apache Foundation.

767
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.090
<v Bart Decrem:>There were 3 or 4 of these

768
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Bart Decrem:>things.

769
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I think the foundation was one

770
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of the earlier ones.

771
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was, uh, the person herding

772
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Bart Decrem:>cats and trying to get votes to

773
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Bart Decrem:>happen and working on the bylaws and

774
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Bart Decrem:>some of that stuff.

775
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Bart Decrem:>I think I was on the board

776
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.030
<v Bart Decrem:>of the I was on the board

777
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.260
<v Bart Decrem:>of the Foundation for a while as

778
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:47.770
<v Bart Decrem:>well.

779
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.330
<v Bart Decrem:>I've done a lot of stuff, and

780
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.379
<v Bart Decrem:>I have a terrible memory.

781
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.500
<v Bart Decrem:>It's a it's a, it's an entrepreneur

782
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.090
<v Bart Decrem:>self-protection mechanism.

783
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.649
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like, don't have two good memories

784
00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.850
<v Bart Decrem:>because there's a lot of action that

785
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.389
<v Bart Decrem:>happens.

786
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, but yes.

787
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.570
<v Karen Herman:>Okay then.

788
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.560
<v Karen Herman:>So so I'll go.

789
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.919
<v Karen Herman:>So.

790
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.910
<v Karen Herman:>So easel goes away.

791
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:04.929
<v Karen Herman:>So what are you what what were

792
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.920
<v Karen Herman:>you going to do?

793
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.120
<v Karen Herman:>What was your next?

794
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:07.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh.

795
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, I was out of the job

796
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.580
<v Bart Decrem:>and broke, uh, and and I had

797
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.670
<v Bart Decrem:>met a Korean entrepreneur, uh, named Eugene

798
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Kim, who had a company called Linux

799
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.320
<v Bart Decrem:>One, but not the controversial one.

800
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.370
<v Bart Decrem:>There was a famous one in the

801
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.129
<v Bart Decrem:>US, but Korea and Japan, they sometimes

802
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.030
<v Bart Decrem:>would do their own thing.

803
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.950
<v Bart Decrem:>And, you know, because they're islands, you

804
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.739
<v Bart Decrem:>know, or peninsulas, there would be like

805
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.050
<v Bart Decrem:>distinct cultural things going on and marketplace

806
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:32.740
<v Bart Decrem:>dynamics.

807
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so we didn't offer me

808
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.639
<v Bart Decrem:>a job in Seoul, and I was

809
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.300
<v Bart Decrem:>like, oh, great.

810
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.149
<v Bart Decrem:>And I moved to Seoul, learned Korean,

811
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.460
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, worked at Linux one thinking about

812
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.860
<v Bart Decrem:>enterprise adoption of Linux and so on.

813
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, worked for a minute at one

814
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.260
<v Bart Decrem:>of these open source companies that offered

815
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.660
<v Bart Decrem:>an alternative to Microsoft Office, I think

816
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.160
<v Bart Decrem:>it was called Ansoft.

817
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and um, and watched people use

818
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.760
<v Bart Decrem:>their phones for everything.

819
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.320
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, this thing

820
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Bart Decrem:>can be a music player and a

821
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.070
<v Bart Decrem:>camera and a dating system.

822
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.120
<v Bart Decrem:>That's interesting.

823
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And so when I came back and

824
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.320
<v Bart Decrem:>a year or two later, the iPhone

825
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.670
<v Bart Decrem:>was announced, I was like, oh my,

826
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.170
<v Bart Decrem:>I've seen that world.

827
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.100
<v Bart Decrem:>It's in Seoul.

828
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.630
<v Bart Decrem:>This is going to be big.

829
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.880
<v Karen Herman:>And is that where you joined?

830
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Jumped over to the Firefox phase just

831
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.280
<v Bart Decrem:>now.

832
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.840
<v Karen Herman:>Exactly.

833
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.290
<v Karen Herman:>So.

834
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.520
<v Karen Herman:>Okay, so how did you get how

835
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.439
<v Karen Herman:>did you get to the Mozilla Foundation?

836
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.160
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

837
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.550
<v Karen Herman:>So I was.

838
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.410
<v Bart Decrem:>In I was in Seoul, I believe,

839
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.179
<v Bart Decrem:>um, working for Linux one and got

840
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.669
<v Bart Decrem:>a call from Mitch Kapoor, if I

841
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.450
<v Bart Decrem:>recall.

842
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.409
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and, um, so this would have

843
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.320
<v Bart Decrem:>been I might get the timeline a

844
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.670
<v Bart Decrem:>little bit wrong, but I'm guessing around

845
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.190
<v Bart Decrem:>2003, maybe 2004.

846
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.270
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, Netscape boy, this is like

847
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.439
<v Bart Decrem:>one of this is the kind of

848
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.699
<v Bart Decrem:>question you ask Neil Patel.

849
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Hey, Neil, tell me the history of

850
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:53.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Netscape.

851
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.730
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, they do these roll ups

852
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.990
<v Bart Decrem:>of what gets bought and spun out

853
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.770
<v Bart Decrem:>and reworked.

854
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.209
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, uh, what's that?

855
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.040
<v Bart Decrem:>What's this podcast called, uh, where they

856
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.620
<v Bart Decrem:>just, like, follows the org chart, um,

857
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Bart Decrem:>decoder.

858
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, this is a decoder episode.

859
00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, Netscape had rolled up into Time

860
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Warner or the other way around, and

861
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.229
<v Bart Decrem:>it hadn't worked out and the market

862
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Bart Decrem:>crashed.

863
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And this whole vision of the future

864
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.370
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of collapsed.

865
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And, um, AOL Time Warner was no

866
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.920
<v Bart Decrem:>longer interested in that asset and were

867
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Bart Decrem:>about to kill off Netscape.

868
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Bart Decrem:>I think they actually made a distribution

869
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.480
<v Bart Decrem:>deal with Microsoft for an explorer.

870
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and Mitchell Baker, um, uh, had

871
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Bart Decrem:>been working on Netscape stuff and Mozilla

872
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.669
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff within that organization.

873
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.919
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm not quite sure the employment history

874
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.959
<v Bart Decrem:>how that works, but I'm sure it's

875
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.070
<v Bart Decrem:>a different chapter in your in your

876
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.700
<v Bart Decrem:>documentary.

877
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.429
<v Bart Decrem:>But Mitch Kapor, uh, had been working

878
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.870
<v Bart Decrem:>with Mitchell on a thing called the

879
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Open Source Application Foundation.

880
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and, and Mitchell connected with Mitch

881
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.709
<v Bart Decrem:>and they were talking about, can we

882
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.440
<v Bart Decrem:>create a gnome fund, a mozilla Foundation?

883
00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and I think the two of

884
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.990
<v Bart Decrem:>them put their heads together.

885
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.280
<v Bart Decrem:>And out of that came the Mozilla

886
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Foundation.

887
00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.770
<v Bart Decrem:>I got a call from Mitch Kapor

888
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.689
<v Bart Decrem:>one day going, hey, we're about to

889
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.920
<v Bart Decrem:>announce the Mozilla Foundation.

890
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.669
<v Bart Decrem:>We got $5 million that Netscape is

891
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.030
<v Bart Decrem:>contributing.

892
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.379
<v Bart Decrem:>Contributing.

893
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:13.700
<v Bart Decrem:>Can you help us write the press

894
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.030
<v Bart Decrem:>release?

895
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.020
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, yeah, I can

896
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.379
<v Bart Decrem:>type.

897
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.610
<v Bart Decrem:>And I sort of like, this is

898
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.530
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of like parts the errands runner.

899
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.639
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, I'm good at running errands,

900
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.120
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

901
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so I typed up or

902
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.310
<v Bart Decrem:>helped with the announcement of the Mozilla

903
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.389
<v Bart Decrem:>Foundation.

904
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And then there was another thing to

905
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.030
<v Bart Decrem:>do and another thing to do.

906
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And so before long, Mitch Kapoor had

907
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.440
<v Bart Decrem:>hired me to work for the Open

908
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.179
<v Bart Decrem:>Source Application Foundation.

909
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.560
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like, go help Mitch with

910
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.790
<v Bart Decrem:>whatever she needs help with.

911
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.070
<v Bart Decrem:>And and this is how I showed

912
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.240
<v Bart Decrem:>up in the newly established Mozilla Foundation,

913
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.909
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to say, about six months

914
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.820
<v Bart Decrem:>before Firefox launched, maybe eight months.

915
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.290
<v Karen Herman:>And you are really involved in that

916
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Karen Herman:>launch?

917
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

918
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.419
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so the early days of the

919
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.760
<v Bart Decrem:>Mozilla Foundation, as I remember them, they

920
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.820
<v Bart Decrem:>were about a dozen people on payroll.

921
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.879
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it was Brendan, you know, shepherding

922
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.699
<v Bart Decrem:>the engine, uh, Chris Hoffman on the

923
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.920
<v Bart Decrem:>community and open source contributor there was

924
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben Goodger.

925
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.750
<v Bart Decrem:>There was a community person.

926
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.550
<v Bart Decrem:>There was Mitchell doing overall governance and

927
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Bart Decrem:>leadership.

928
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And in total there was about a

929
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.620
<v Bart Decrem:>dozen people working in the foundation, you

930
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.100
<v Bart Decrem:>know, uh, and, um, and, and I

931
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.920
<v Bart Decrem:>was asked to help with fundraising.

932
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:25.699
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, can you help us

933
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Bart Decrem:>figure out how to bring in $1

934
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Bart Decrem:>million a year so we can keep

935
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.630
<v Bart Decrem:>the lights on when this AOL money

936
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.050
<v Bart Decrem:>dries up?

937
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.180
<v Bart Decrem:>It was the original sort of charge.

938
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.800
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I noticed that there was

939
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.240
<v Bart Decrem:>this thing called the Mozilla suite.

940
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:38.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Mozilla.

941
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.439
<v Bart Decrem:>I forget what it was called.

942
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.490
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it was called the Mozilla

943
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Suite, and that was then repackaged into

944
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.770
<v Bart Decrem:>the Netscape Communicator suite, if I recall

945
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.370
<v Bart Decrem:>that product name.

946
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.939
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

947
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.770
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and that was where the users

948
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:49.310
<v Bart Decrem:>were.

949
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.429
<v Bart Decrem:>But but there was this there were

950
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.990
<v Bart Decrem:>2 or 3 people that were doing

951
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.220
<v Bart Decrem:>something else.

952
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there was an email.

953
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.169
<v Bart Decrem:>There was a guy working on an

954
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.689
<v Bart Decrem:>email app called Thunderbird, and there were

955
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Bart Decrem:>2 or 3 people, Ben and Blake

956
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.740
<v Bart Decrem:>and a few others and Joe Hewitt,

957
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.230
<v Bart Decrem:>that were working on a new browser.

958
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Bart Decrem:>It was called Firebird.

959
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Then Phoenix or maybe Phoenix.

960
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:09.920
<v Bart Decrem:>Phoenix.

961
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Then Firebird.

962
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.540
<v Bart Decrem:>Then Firefox.

963
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And so there was this thing out

964
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.260
<v Bart Decrem:>there that was rough around the edges.

965
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.620
<v Bart Decrem:>And they were.

966
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.960
<v Bart Decrem:>The Mozilla was a pirate ship.

967
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.979
<v Bart Decrem:>And then in the pirate ship, there

968
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.330
<v Bart Decrem:>was a little sub pirate ship, you

969
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Bart Decrem:>know.

970
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.220
<v Bart Decrem:>So now we're like in a sandbox.

971
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.780
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was the three of them

972
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.070
<v Bart Decrem:>building a four of them, building a

973
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.310
<v Bart Decrem:>browser, sort of without anybody's permission, using

974
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.860
<v Bart Decrem:>all of the code, you know, from

975
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.250
<v Bart Decrem:>ten years of Netscape development, but building

976
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.170
<v Bart Decrem:>a much simpler product that just did

977
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.450
<v Bart Decrem:>one thing browsing the web without annoying

978
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.090
<v Bart Decrem:>pop ups, and you could feel energy

979
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.290
<v Bart Decrem:>around that.

980
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.959
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, so I was an early advocate

981
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.360
<v Bart Decrem:>within the organization saying, hey, Mitchell, let's

982
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.110
<v Bart Decrem:>this is cool.

983
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.010
<v Bart Decrem:>We should focus on this.

984
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.900
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the first thing that I

985
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.250
<v Bart Decrem:>ended up working on was the rebranding,

986
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.590
<v Bart Decrem:>because we had to go because they

987
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.720
<v Bart Decrem:>had just moved from Phoenix, which was

988
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.969
<v Bart Decrem:>a trademark issue, to Firebird, which has

989
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Bart Decrem:>a different trademark issue.

990
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.540
<v Bart Decrem:>And I believe Mitchell asked me to

991
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.580
<v Bart Decrem:>help come up with a name for

992
00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.390
<v Bart Decrem:>the thing.

993
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.040
<v Bart Decrem:>And I sat down with, um, with

994
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.560
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben and a few other folks, and

995
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben picked Firefox.

996
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.330
<v Bart Decrem:>And then overnight, a logo was born

997
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.580
<v Bart Decrem:>in the community, and I so, so

998
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.870
<v Bart Decrem:>so that was my first project of

999
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.090
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of like coordinating, coming up with

1000
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.860
<v Bart Decrem:>a new name and a new logo.

1001
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:28.310
<v Bart Decrem:>So, so where.

1002
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.500
<v Karen Herman:>Did where did Firefox come from?

1003
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.940
<v Karen Herman:>What, what?

1004
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.899
<v Karen Herman:>Well.

1005
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.090
<v Bart Decrem:>Phoenix rises from the ashes.

1006
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.050
<v Bart Decrem:>So that was that one Firebird.

1007
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.500
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it might be Ben.

1008
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.920
<v Bart Decrem:>Like sporty cars, American muscle cars and

1009
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.840
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of that, sort of that land

1010
00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.280
<v Bart Decrem:>of branding is I think what it

1011
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.300
<v Bart Decrem:>probably because there was a thing called

1012
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Thunderbird, which is the email client.

1013
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.129
<v Bart Decrem:>So I think Scott's the person that

1014
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.500
<v Bart Decrem:>came that that was leading Thunderbird and

1015
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.330
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben, they were they might have had

1016
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.350
<v Bart Decrem:>they might have been hanging out at

1017
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.790
<v Bart Decrem:>the bar talking about cars after hours.

1018
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.820
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm not sure how they came up

1019
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Bart Decrem:>with Thunderbird, but in Firebird.

1020
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.010
<v Bart Decrem:>But.

1021
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.889
<v Bart Decrem:>So Firebird had a trademark issue, and

1022
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.760
<v Bart Decrem:>so we did a name storming internally.

1023
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.179
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I'm pretty sure this came

1024
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.540
<v Bart Decrem:>up with Firefox, and I think it's

1025
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.490
<v Bart Decrem:>just a word that came out that

1026
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.860
<v Bart Decrem:>he had heard, but I don't think

1027
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Bart Decrem:>he'd seen the picture yet.

1028
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:24.419
<v Bart Decrem:>You know what I mean?

1029
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.169
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, it's one of these things where

1030
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.520
<v Bart Decrem:>you're sitting at a name storm and

1031
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.500
<v Bart Decrem:>I've, I've started too many things in

1032
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:28.980
<v Bart Decrem:>my career.

1033
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.000
<v Bart Decrem:>So this is a thing I've done

1034
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.990
<v Bart Decrem:>like a dozen times.

1035
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Bart Decrem:>More than a dozen times.

1036
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.199
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so Firefox rolled off of

1037
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.500
<v Bart Decrem:>his tongue and, and we figured out

1038
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Bart Decrem:>the backstory of the animal, and we're

1039
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.100
<v Bart Decrem:>like, that's cool and cute.

1040
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.649
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, what kind of imagery goes along

1041
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:43.889
<v Bart Decrem:>with that?

1042
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.200
<v Bart Decrem:>It feels kind of speedy and fiery

1043
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.150
<v Bart Decrem:>and exciting, and it's sort of a

1044
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.949
<v Bart Decrem:>it's it's different from Firebird, but it's

1045
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.000
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of it's sort of part of

1046
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.129
<v Bart Decrem:>a brand, you know, evolution.

1047
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.629
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, yeah.

1048
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben Goodyear just, um, just just a

1049
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Bart Decrem:>word that that he, he, he had

1050
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.390
<v Bart Decrem:>conviction around.

1051
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.879
<v Bart Decrem:>This has been a thing that I've

1052
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Bart Decrem:>always been a fan of, which is

1053
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.600
<v Bart Decrem:>in consumer products, whether it be at

1054
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.180
<v Bart Decrem:>Walt Disney Company or in open source.

1055
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.380
<v Bart Decrem:>I've always loved product that's driven by

1056
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Bart Decrem:>engineers and I've always loved product.

1057
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.120
<v Bart Decrem:>That's where there's a strong opinion in

1058
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.230
<v Bart Decrem:>the middle of it, as opposed to

1059
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of like surveys and market research

1060
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.580
<v Bart Decrem:>and business analysis and product requirements analysis,

1061
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Bart Decrem:>like here's a person with conviction and

1062
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.560
<v Bart Decrem:>ideally, that person with conviction then goes

1063
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.189
<v Bart Decrem:>and builds it.

1064
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.020
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, when you come across a

1065
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.320
<v Bart Decrem:>person that's really good at putting their

1066
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas into action, into code, and they

1067
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.649
<v Bart Decrem:>have really strong conviction and their ideas

1068
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.239
<v Bart Decrem:>hit, you know, for a moment in

1069
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.440
<v Bart Decrem:>time in the culture.

1070
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.300
<v Bart Decrem:>That's the thing that I'm always looking

1071
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:48.600
<v Bart Decrem:>for.

1072
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.800
<v Bart Decrem:>And I found that like 2 or

1073
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.090
<v Bart Decrem:>3 times in my career and sort

1074
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.650
<v Bart Decrem:>of almost found it like 20 times,

1075
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.820
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, and there's a big difference

1076
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.260
<v Bart Decrem:>between almost finding it and finding it.

1077
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.860
<v Bart Decrem:>But Ben and Blake and Joe and

1078
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.180
<v Bart Decrem:>the other folks working on Firefox.

1079
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.060
<v Bart Decrem:>They had found that thing where there

1080
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.210
<v Bart Decrem:>was a product that had conviction and

1081
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.070
<v Bart Decrem:>a strong sense of curation, which is

1082
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.020
<v Bart Decrem:>saying, no, which is open source, is

1083
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.900
<v Bart Decrem:>very, very historically very bad at that,

1084
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.389
<v Bart Decrem:>just because of consensus, you know, um,

1085
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.560
<v Bart Decrem:>systems.

1086
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.449
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so when Ben came up

1087
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.290
<v Bart Decrem:>with the name, I was like, it's

1088
00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.510
<v Bart Decrem:>it's his thing, you know, he this

1089
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.290
<v Bart Decrem:>is his thing.

1090
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And we're betting on Ben and the

1091
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.360
<v Bart Decrem:>crew.

1092
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.100
<v Bart Decrem:>And so when in doubt, you go

1093
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:27.330
<v Bart Decrem:>with that person because you're going to

1094
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.949
<v Bart Decrem:>end up with a product that that

1095
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.430
<v Bart Decrem:>has a that you can sense authorship

1096
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.000
<v Bart Decrem:>behind.

1097
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.139
<v Bart Decrem:>And so for me, one of the

1098
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.939
<v Bart Decrem:>reasons I love the name Firefox is

1099
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.310
<v Bart Decrem:>that it was like, that's his choice.

1100
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.840
<v Bart Decrem:>And this is his product.

1101
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.520
<v Bart Decrem:>And you can feel it when you're

1102
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:41.879
<v Bart Decrem:>using it.

1103
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.290
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, there's a person here that

1104
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.639
<v Bart Decrem:>cared, right?

1105
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.230
<v Karen Herman:>And you were in charge of marketing

1106
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Karen Herman:>it.

1107
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Karen Herman:>Um.

1108
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

1109
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.210
<v Bart Decrem:>It was it was a I mean,

1110
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.350
<v Bart Decrem:>the whole thing was a cabal, right?

1111
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.699
<v Bart Decrem:>So there's like a dozen people, everybody's

1112
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.020
<v Bart Decrem:>doing seven different things.

1113
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.899
<v Bart Decrem:>And so What does it mean to

1114
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.890
<v Bart Decrem:>be in charge of marketing?

1115
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.500
<v Bart Decrem:>The thing marketed itself because it was

1116
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.020
<v Bart Decrem:>great software and it hit, you know,

1117
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Bart Decrem:>product market fit.

1118
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.540
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that's just the thing.

1119
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.430
<v Bart Decrem:>Ben Goodger did and that Microsoft did,

1120
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.719
<v Bart Decrem:>you know like that just happened.

1121
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

1122
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And so and then it got a

1123
00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:13.799
<v Bart Decrem:>name and a logo.

1124
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.089
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's because there was a designer

1125
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.949
<v Bart Decrem:>with a great idea and Ben with

1126
00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:18.270
<v Bart Decrem:>conviction on the name.

1127
00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:22.110
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so the job of marketing and

1128
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.220
<v Bart Decrem:>so to the extent that I was

1129
00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.530
<v Bart Decrem:>in charge of marketing, the job was

1130
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.109
<v Bart Decrem:>just to corral and organize the energy

1131
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.460
<v Bart Decrem:>and just sort of move the process

1132
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.679
<v Bart Decrem:>along, which is weird because I'm not

1133
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.690
<v Bart Decrem:>this is not my superpower to sort

1134
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.210
<v Bart Decrem:>of find consensus and move process along.

1135
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.310
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but that's really what I did.

1136
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.860
<v Bart Decrem:>There was like, hey, there's a lot

1137
00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.870
<v Bart Decrem:>of people that love this thing.

1138
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.050
<v Bart Decrem:>It's just just help organize that energy,

1139
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.319
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

1140
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.720
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that meant, oh, is anybody

1141
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.440
<v Bart Decrem:>working on locally?

1142
00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Hey, Chris, how many people are translating

1143
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox?

1144
00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.940
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, can we have little landing pages

1145
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.219
<v Bart Decrem:>and websites Translator two can those folks

1146
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:57.630
<v Bart Decrem:>all make announcements and try to get

1147
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.490
<v Bart Decrem:>some local press coverage, you know?

1148
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.620
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, oh, there's a guy named Chris

1149
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Messina.

1150
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.240
<v Bart Decrem:>He wants to take out an ad

1151
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:03.990
<v Bart Decrem:>in the New York Times.

1152
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.760
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, there's somebody had the idea of

1153
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.140
<v Bart Decrem:>a site called Spread Firefox.

1154
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.920
<v Bart Decrem:>Let's do that.

1155
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.900
<v Bart Decrem:>It was sort of, you know, grabbing

1156
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.060
<v Bart Decrem:>that energy and focusing it, not unlike

1157
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.799
<v Bart Decrem:>political campaigns, you know, like there's a

1158
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.060
<v Bart Decrem:>lot of grassroots energy.

1159
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.350
<v Bart Decrem:>And then and then you're trying to

1160
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.430
<v Bart Decrem:>deploy that energy, right?

1161
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.650
<v Bart Decrem:>Or channel it in certain directions that

1162
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.759
<v Bart Decrem:>are more productive than others.

1163
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.210
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1164
00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.580
<v Karen Herman:>Were there any unique choices in marketing

1165
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.920
<v Karen Herman:>an open source browser?

1166
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.630
<v Karen Herman:>I mean, does did it matter to

1167
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.880
<v Karen Herman:>consumers at all, or did you use

1168
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Karen Herman:>a different kind of technique to do

1169
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.189
<v Karen Herman:>it?

1170
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah, we we I think we this

1171
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.259
<v Bart Decrem:>is going to sound real fancy, but

1172
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Bart Decrem:>but it wasn't you know, but but

1173
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Bart Decrem:>but but it is true that we

1174
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Bart Decrem:>spoke just like today.

1175
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Bart Decrem:>You can go to Mozilla.org.

1176
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's different from Firefox.

1177
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Bart Decrem:>Com you know, um, when we talk

1178
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Bart Decrem:>to developers and, and the nerds on

1179
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Slashdot, right.

1180
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Or you know, that that would have

1181
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.470
<v Bart Decrem:>been maybe the place at that time,

1182
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:53.980
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

1183
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.640
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, you're talking about monopoly and open

1184
00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.620
<v Bart Decrem:>source, and if you love Linux, but

1185
00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.150
<v Bart Decrem:>you want to try it and you're

1186
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.200
<v Bart Decrem:>a fan of open source, here's something

1187
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.100
<v Bart Decrem:>you can download.

1188
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.960
<v Bart Decrem:>So that was part of how we

1189
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.990
<v Bart Decrem:>communicated with that core community.

1190
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.660
<v Bart Decrem:>I was just reading a story overnight,

1191
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.720
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, that talks about, oh, Casey Newton

1192
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.350
<v Bart Decrem:>in platformer this morning, talks about, uh,

1193
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.810
<v Bart Decrem:>ChatGPT is now a search engine.

1194
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And then Casey story goes back to

1195
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.000
<v Bart Decrem:>how, um, Paul Graham when he started

1196
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.870
<v Bart Decrem:>Y-combinator.

1197
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:26.710
<v Bart Decrem:>So this would have been like ten

1198
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.750
<v Bart Decrem:>years ago, talked about somebody to go

1199
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:29.830
<v Bart Decrem:>build a search engine.

1200
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:30.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And the way you start a search

1201
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.830
<v Bart Decrem:>engine to go after Google is you

1202
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.960
<v Bart Decrem:>build one that is used by all

1203
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.030
<v Bart Decrem:>the hackers, meaning the people in Y-combinator.

1204
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.299
<v Bart Decrem:>Right?

1205
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.830
<v Bart Decrem:>The startups in Y Combinator.

1206
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.540
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's very small, but it's very

1207
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.410
<v Bart Decrem:>influential that that core idea we were

1208
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.870
<v Bart Decrem:>obviously doing at Firefox as well is

1209
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.460
<v Bart Decrem:>like, there's these folks here that are

1210
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.589
<v Bart Decrem:>very influential, and we're talking to them

1211
00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.480
<v Bart Decrem:>about the values and the politics and

1212
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.890
<v Bart Decrem:>all that stuff, you know?

1213
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:59.020
<v Bart Decrem:>But but the thing is 2005, I

1214
00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.200
<v Bart Decrem:>forget.

1215
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.280
<v Bart Decrem:>I forget what the exact year is

1216
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.740
<v Bart Decrem:>that Firefox 1.0 went out, but but

1217
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.050
<v Bart Decrem:>about that time what was going on.

1218
00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.300
<v Bart Decrem:>Is that one of the top stories,

1219
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.799
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, of the year would have

1220
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.629
<v Bart Decrem:>been, uh, spyware, uh, and pop ups

1221
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.820
<v Bart Decrem:>and web nuisances and people trying to

1222
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.890
<v Bart Decrem:>steal your credit card information from the

1223
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Bart Decrem:>internet and so on.

1224
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.910
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and Internet Explorer had gained monopoly

1225
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:25.180
<v Bart Decrem:>power.

1226
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.920
<v Bart Decrem:>It was like 98% market share, and

1227
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.510
<v Bart Decrem:>they were just not innovating it.

1228
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.010
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was a it was a

1229
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Bart Decrem:>bad product.

1230
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.440
<v Bart Decrem:>And people would there would be all

1231
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.750
<v Bart Decrem:>these pop ups and nuisances and it

1232
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.670
<v Bart Decrem:>would be dangerous and confusing, you know?

1233
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we just had a better

1234
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.080
<v Bart Decrem:>problem product that solved that problem.

1235
00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.110
<v Bart Decrem:>And so when we but the way

1236
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox took off was that your cousin,

1237
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, who's into computers.

1238
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.790
<v Bart Decrem:>He's using it because he loves it.

1239
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.880
<v Bart Decrem:>And then, you know, grandma's nervous because

1240
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.650
<v Bart Decrem:>somebody tried to steal her credit card,

1241
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.240
<v Bart Decrem:>or there's too many windows on her

1242
00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.810
<v Bart Decrem:>screen.

1243
00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Bart Decrem:>And then.

1244
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.730
<v Bart Decrem:>And then the cousin says, oh, download

1245
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Bart Decrem:>this thing.

1246
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.129
<v Bart Decrem:>It doesn't have that problem.

1247
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.660
<v Bart Decrem:>So you ended up with a really

1248
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.060
<v Bart Decrem:>strong marketing message, which was like, this

1249
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.330
<v Bart Decrem:>browser is better and keeps you safe.

1250
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.130
<v Bart Decrem:>It's very simple marketing.

1251
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.169
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and it was brought to you,

1252
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.930
<v Bart Decrem:>told you by, you know, the weird

1253
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.150
<v Bart Decrem:>cousin that keeps your computer running.

1254
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.190
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's how we got to was

1255
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Bart Decrem:>it 70% market share, ultimately.

1256
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:23.950
<v Karen Herman:>Wow.

1257
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.479
<v Karen Herman:>And you also worked on one second.

1258
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.530
<v Bart Decrem:>I need to I need to I

1259
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.820
<v Bart Decrem:>need to blow my nose here for

1260
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.270
<v Bart Decrem:>a second.

1261
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think I'm going to set

1262
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:29.620
<v Bart Decrem:>the dog free.

1263
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.220
<v Bart Decrem:>Is that okay?

1264
00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:30.520
<v Bart Decrem:>You know what?

1265
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.750
<v Karen Herman:>I'm going to stop recording.

1266
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Okay.

1267
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.029
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1268
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.710
<v Bart Decrem:>All right, I'm back.

1269
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.669
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1270
00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.470
<v Bart Decrem:>Doggies may wander through from time to

1271
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Bart Decrem:>time now.

1272
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1273
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Bart Decrem:>You and also barking may occur from

1274
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:03.669
<v Bart Decrem:>time to time.

1275
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Karen Herman:>So far, I haven't heard a thing.

1276
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1277
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Right, right.

1278
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Cuz the cleaners came in and the

1279
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.819
<v Bart Decrem:>AirPods filter out the background noise.

1280
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.259
<v Bart Decrem:>But there's probably going to be at

1281
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.399
<v Bart Decrem:>least a little moment where they start

1282
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Bart Decrem:>barking, and then you'll redo the question

1283
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Bart Decrem:>as needed.

1284
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1285
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Karen Herman:>Sounds good.

1286
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.089
<v Karen Herman:>Okay, I think we're we are recording

1287
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Karen Herman:>again.

1288
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1289
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Karen Herman:>I was just about to ask you

1290
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Karen Herman:>about, um, you know, you also were

1291
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Karen Herman:>building partnerships with with corporations.

1292
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.300
<v Karen Herman:>Google, Yahoo!

1293
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.279
<v Karen Herman:>Um, how did that work with with

1294
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Karen Herman:>open source and what you were trying

1295
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:33.490
<v Karen Herman:>to do?

1296
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.790
<v Bart Decrem:>So funny.

1297
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Bart Decrem:>As soon as I leave the dogs,

1298
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Bart Decrem:>they start barking.

1299
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, well, maybe that maybe

1300
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Bart Decrem:>the.

1301
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Karen Herman:>I barely I barely hear it.

1302
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh yeah.

1303
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Bart Decrem:>No, These microphones are all good.

1304
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but right now, they're.

1305
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

1306
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Now they're barking.

1307
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Bart Decrem:>So I'm just going to.

1308
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Bart Decrem:>I'll just trust that you'll tell me

1309
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.029
<v Bart Decrem:>if it's interfering, or we just start

1310
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.379
<v Bart Decrem:>over, and then I'll get the dogs

1311
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:56.680
<v Bart Decrem:>out of the way.

1312
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Bart Decrem:>Or will we do the question?

1313
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, your question was, how do we

1314
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Bart Decrem:>think about partnerships?

1315
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

1316
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:02.740
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1317
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.140
<v Karen Herman:>Because you partnered with Google and Yahoo

1318
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:05.319
<v Karen Herman:>and.

1319
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:05.529
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1320
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Karen Herman:>So how did that how did that

1321
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.430
<v Karen Herman:>work being an open source, you know,

1322
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.890
<v Karen Herman:>philosophy that you guys had?

1323
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, when we did easel, I remember

1324
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.479
<v Bart Decrem:>getting a call one day, I picked

1325
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Bart Decrem:>up the phone in the office and

1326
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Bart Decrem:>it was Michael Dell on the phone,

1327
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.020
<v Bart Decrem:>and he was ready to invest.

1328
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Bart Decrem:>And we had just raised money and

1329
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Bart Decrem:>decided we didn't need it.

1330
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.259
<v Bart Decrem:>And we sort of politely, you know,

1331
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.160
<v Bart Decrem:>declined.

1332
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Bart Decrem:>And and years later, this would have

1333
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Bart Decrem:>been fabulous.

1334
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Bart Decrem:>That phone call happened again with the

1335
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Bart Decrem:>same Michael Dell on the other side.

1336
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, but so by the time

1337
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.700
<v Bart Decrem:>I got to Firefox, I was like,

1338
00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.040
<v Bart Decrem:>money's good, you know?

1339
00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.029
<v Bart Decrem:>And so, like, right now I'm in

1340
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.890
<v Bart Decrem:>the Mastodon world and I'm like, no,

1341
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.990
<v Bart Decrem:>no, no money's good.

1342
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.270
<v Bart Decrem:>Even if you don't love capitalism, because

1343
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.040
<v Bart Decrem:>it's like you need resources to get

1344
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.310
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff done and only volunteers, it's very

1345
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.370
<v Bart Decrem:>hard to ship, especially consumer product.

1346
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.320
<v Bart Decrem:>It works for SQL and other things.

1347
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.669
<v Bart Decrem:>But but if you're trying to build

1348
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.010
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox, if you're trying to make Mastodon

1349
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.730
<v Bart Decrem:>user friendly, it takes people doing annoying

1350
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.470
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff for months and months at a

1351
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:19.669
<v Bart Decrem:>time, and they don't do that for

1352
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.940
<v Bart Decrem:>free.

1353
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Or not enough of them do that

1354
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:23.450
<v Bart Decrem:>for free at the right level of,

1355
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.190
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, of of commitment and so

1356
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.640
<v Bart Decrem:>on.

1357
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so by the time we got

1358
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.730
<v Bart Decrem:>to Firefox 0.7, there was a real

1359
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Bart Decrem:>groundswell.

1360
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Bart Decrem:>And I remember putting out those, those,

1361
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Bart Decrem:>those builds, you know, Firefox 0.70.71 and

1362
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Bart Decrem:>so on.

1363
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Bart Decrem:>And every time, every time we put

1364
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.529
<v Bart Decrem:>out one of these announcements, there would

1365
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Bart Decrem:>be more downloads than the last one,

1366
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.740
<v Bart Decrem:>and it would be like, oh shoot,

1367
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Bart Decrem:>we got like a million downloads.

1368
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And then it's like a million and

1369
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Bart Decrem:>a half downloads and then 2 million

1370
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Bart Decrem:>downloads.

1371
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, we need more servers because the

1372
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.310
<v Bart Decrem:>servers are going to melt.

1373
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Bart Decrem:>That was a thing, you know.

1374
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so you could feel the

1375
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.529
<v Bart Decrem:>energy around Firefox building.

1376
00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.049
<v Bart Decrem:>By the time we got to 0.700.8

1377
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Bart Decrem:>and we knew that there was a

1378
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Bart Decrem:>lot of people at Google using it.

1379
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't know how we knew that.

1380
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm going to guess that it was

1381
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Bart Decrem:>like Ben Goodger nerding out and going

1382
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.810
<v Bart Decrem:>like, or Chris Hoffman or you know,

1383
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Bart Decrem:>or you know, or Brendon for that

1384
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.830
<v Bart Decrem:>matter, going, look at our download logs.

1385
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Bart Decrem:>We got like 50,000 downloads from google.com

1386
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Bart Decrem:>or something.

1387
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Bart Decrem:>There's probably something like that is how

1388
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.280
<v Bart Decrem:>we figured it out, you know.

1389
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and um, and I remember my

1390
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.840
<v Bart Decrem:>personal goal or my, my job description

1391
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Bart Decrem:>was fined us $1 million so you

1392
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Bart Decrem:>can keep the lights on.

1393
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.180
<v Bart Decrem:>And I had two good ideas.

1394
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.070
<v Bart Decrem:>The first one was like, oh, let's

1395
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.529
<v Bart Decrem:>put a PayPal button in the browser

1396
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Bart Decrem:>and like, like, you know, help support

1397
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Bart Decrem:>kind of thing, you know, and and

1398
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Bart Decrem:>very quickly we started money started coming

1399
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.509
<v Bart Decrem:>in and you could see that it

1400
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Bart Decrem:>would, you could see that that would

1401
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.359
<v Bart Decrem:>be $1 million over a year.

1402
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Just the PayPal button, you know, because

1403
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.089
<v Bart Decrem:>there was just people love this thing

1404
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Bart Decrem:>and they wanted to be part of

1405
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.190
<v Bart Decrem:>it and the vibes were good and

1406
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.819
<v Bart Decrem:>so on.

1407
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Bart Decrem:>And then the second idea was there

1408
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Bart Decrem:>was a guy that called, one day

1409
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.350
<v Bart Decrem:>the phone rings and there's a guy

1410
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Bart Decrem:>on the phone and goes like, hey,

1411
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Bart Decrem:>I would like to talk to you

1412
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.819
<v Bart Decrem:>about our CD and Books and Manuals

1413
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.440
<v Bart Decrem:>program for Netscape, and we want to

1414
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Bart Decrem:>bring it over to Firefox.

1415
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, you're doing what?

1416
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, I'm selling CDs.

1417
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to sell CDs and manuals

1418
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.930
<v Bart Decrem:>with fire CDs with Firefox on them,

1419
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Bart Decrem:>and manuals for Firefox.

1420
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Bart Decrem:>So, you know, there's a thing called

1421
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Bart Decrem:>the internet and you can just click

1422
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.160
<v Bart Decrem:>on a link and then you don't

1423
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:22.609
<v Bart Decrem:>need to pay.

1424
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.650
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, he's like, yeah, but people

1425
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Bart Decrem:>like to have the physical thing.

1426
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.319
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, all right, I don't

1427
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Bart Decrem:>have time for this.

1428
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.670
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, no, no, no, you get

1429
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Bart Decrem:>a lot of money.

1430
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, well, how much?

1431
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like $1 million.

1432
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we did a distribution deal

1433
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Bart Decrem:>around Firefox and Mozilla, but then Firefox

1434
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:43.009
<v Bart Decrem:>on on CD and manuals that people

1435
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Bart Decrem:>could, and that looked like it was

1436
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.860
<v Bart Decrem:>going to be $1 million a year

1437
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Bart Decrem:>to, you know.

1438
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.840
<v Bart Decrem:>So I was like, wow, this, this

1439
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.010
<v Bart Decrem:>is really working.

1440
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, um, and then I remember

1441
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.390
<v Bart Decrem:>waking up one day and reading about

1442
00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:01.759
<v Bart Decrem:>Askjeeves and how, uh, Google was being

1443
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.859
<v Bart Decrem:>achieved, 70% of the ad revenue that

1444
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Bart Decrem:>was coming in to Google through Askjeeves,

1445
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Bart Decrem:>which was one of these things that

1446
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:08.630
<v Bart Decrem:>had a logo on it.

1447
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Bart Decrem:>And then it was search results and

1448
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Bart Decrem:>ads, both delivered by Google, and the

1449
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Bart Decrem:>revenue split was 70%.

1450
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Bart Decrem:>So I remember calling Mitch Kapoor and

1451
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.319
<v Bart Decrem:>going, hey, Mitch, do you know anybody

1452
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.129
<v Bart Decrem:>at Google?

1453
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.509
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, yeah, I know Sergey and

1454
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Larry.

1455
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:21.680
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, why don't you call

1456
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Bart Decrem:>them?

1457
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Because we should have a meeting with

1458
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Bart Decrem:>them, because we got this search box

1459
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Bart Decrem:>up there and they're paying people good

1460
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Bart Decrem:>money for that.

1461
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, he's like, whatever.

1462
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.830
<v Bart Decrem:>Sure, I'll set that up.

1463
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so, um, and so Mitchell

1464
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:36.950
<v Bart Decrem:>and myself and Mitch.

1465
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.880
<v Bart Decrem:>We basically worked together with Larry and

1466
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Sergey, and I think it was those

1467
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.299
<v Bart Decrem:>were the two principals in the room

1468
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.370
<v Bart Decrem:>at the time at Google and got

1469
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.950
<v Bart Decrem:>the first search monetization deal done.

1470
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.630
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that was the first of

1471
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.690
<v Bart Decrem:>its kind, that thing that has been

1472
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.880
<v Bart Decrem:>in the news about the antitrust stuff

1473
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.650
<v Bart Decrem:>around search distribution.

1474
00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.920
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I'm pretty sure that that was

1475
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.580
<v Bart Decrem:>our deal.

1476
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.560
<v Bart Decrem:>That was the first of its kind

1477
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.020
<v Bart Decrem:>is where Firefox, we went to Sergey

1478
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.270
<v Bart Decrem:>and Larry and negotiated a revenue split

1479
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.980
<v Bart Decrem:>on the search box in the upper

1480
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.140
<v Bart Decrem:>right corner of Firefox.

1481
00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:13.400
<v Karen Herman:>Wow.

1482
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Karen Herman:>And so so you were there until

1483
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.720
<v Karen Herman:>2005?

1484
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:18.200
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

1485
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.940
<v Bart Decrem:>It looks like like literally like a

1486
00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.980
<v Bart Decrem:>month after Firefox one left.

1487
00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.560
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I'm an entrepreneur.

1488
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.000
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm impatient.

1489
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.950
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't love process.

1490
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.470
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm really great at starting things, but

1491
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm not always great at seeing them

1492
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:32.480
<v Bart Decrem:>through.

1493
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And, um, you know, as you get

1494
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Bart Decrem:>older, you sort of learn that there's

1495
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Bart Decrem:>different attributes to leadership and different kinds

1496
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of leadership.

1497
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Bart Decrem:>And being a CEO is not the

1498
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Bart Decrem:>same as being a founder.

1499
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Bart Decrem:>It's not the same as being an

1500
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Bart Decrem:>entrepreneur.

1501
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.879
<v Bart Decrem:>So you figure out there's all this

1502
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.480
<v Bart Decrem:>nuance.

1503
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.050
<v Bart Decrem:>And so, um, my superpower is I

1504
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.359
<v Bart Decrem:>get excited sometimes I get excited about

1505
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Bart Decrem:>things that are good, you know, um,

1506
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Bart Decrem:>and I have energy and can get

1507
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.900
<v Bart Decrem:>people excited about them.

1508
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I am not good at being

1509
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Bart Decrem:>a manager in the sense of bringing

1510
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.600
<v Bart Decrem:>order and stability and predictability, and I'm

1511
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Bart Decrem:>really good at finding waves and jumping

1512
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Bart Decrem:>on them.

1513
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.899
<v Bart Decrem:>And that doesn't mean that I'm really

1514
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Bart Decrem:>good at sort of stabilizing things and

1515
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Bart Decrem:>managing them.

1516
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:13.920
<v Bart Decrem:>So after Firefox went out, it was

1517
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Bart Decrem:>like, this thing is a big hit.

1518
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Bart Decrem:>We need to do another 74 things

1519
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.319
<v Bart Decrem:>in the next 24 hours, you know,

1520
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.390
<v Bart Decrem:>to get another billion downloads.

1521
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.649
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I think mostly wisely, Mitchell

1522
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Bart Decrem:>was like, okay, that's too crazy.

1523
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Bart Decrem:>We need to now we're in a

1524
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.029
<v Bart Decrem:>different phase and we need to now

1525
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Bart Decrem:>manage this growth.

1526
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.089
<v Bart Decrem:>And then a few months later, John

1527
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Lilly came in who's just amazing.

1528
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I think he became the CEO,

1529
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.700
<v Bart Decrem:>but I left within a few months

1530
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Bart Decrem:>and was like, I got lots of

1531
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas of what we can do with

1532
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Bart Decrem:>the browser.

1533
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Bart Decrem:>And we built one called FLoC.

1534
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and we had a great

1535
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Bart Decrem:>start.

1536
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:48.390
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I did not do a

1537
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Bart Decrem:>good job, you know, sort of shipping

1538
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Bart Decrem:>it all the way through 1.0.

1539
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Bart Decrem:>I think I underestimated the journey from

1540
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Bart Decrem:>really cool demo to 1.0.

1541
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Hopefully I've gotten better at that.

1542
00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.940
<v Bart Decrem:>But but.

1543
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Bart Decrem:>So after Firefox, I got impatient and

1544
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.529
<v Bart Decrem:>started a browser company called FLoC, a

1545
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.569
<v Bart Decrem:>browser based on Firefox.

1546
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and that moves faster.

1547
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Bart Decrem:>Lots of great ideas.

1548
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, but but we shipped a product

1549
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Bart Decrem:>that wasn't ready.

1550
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.270
<v Karen Herman:>Now, now, was that were you considered

1551
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.760
<v Karen Herman:>then a competitor?

1552
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.049
<v Karen Herman:>We were an.

1553
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Open source browser on top of the

1554
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox code base.

1555
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.960
<v Bart Decrem:>And so some people in the Mozilla

1556
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Bart Decrem:>community were annoyed by that.

1557
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, why are you competing with the

1558
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Bart Decrem:>with the mothership?

1559
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.549
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's a good cause and all

1560
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.030
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

1561
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.350
<v Bart Decrem:>And then some people in the Mozilla

1562
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:32.310
<v Bart Decrem:>Muslim community are like, that's great.

1563
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:33.690
<v Bart Decrem:>We want there to be multiple browsers,

1564
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:33.870
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

1565
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And so so we built it.

1566
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.650
<v Bart Decrem:>We we used the open source license

1567
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.630
<v Bart Decrem:>and built a browser largely based mostly

1568
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.360
<v Bart Decrem:>based on, on the Firefox engine and,

1569
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.680
<v Bart Decrem:>and the Chrome as well.

1570
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:44.010
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1571
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.990
<v Karen Herman:>It was considered a social web browser.

1572
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.650
<v Karen Herman:>What did that mean?

1573
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:46.830
<v Karen Herman:>What?

1574
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.730
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah, yeah.

1575
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, there was we had a lot

1576
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.310
<v Bart Decrem:>of good ideas, and then we didn't

1577
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:54.750
<v Bart Decrem:>do a good enough job curating them.

1578
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.090
<v Bart Decrem:>But a lot of these ideas still

1579
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.470
<v Bart Decrem:>seem really good today.

1580
00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.830
<v Bart Decrem:>Even I've been working on on Mastodon

1581
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.340
<v Bart Decrem:>and Activitypub more recently and reconnected with

1582
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.180
<v Bart Decrem:>Chris Messina.

1583
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.500
<v Bart Decrem:>And then sometimes I'm on the phone

1584
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.640
<v Bart Decrem:>with Chris and he'll be like, hey,

1585
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.650
<v Bart Decrem:>Bart, we had the same idea in

1586
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.669
<v Bart Decrem:>2007.

1587
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And remember, these are all the same

1588
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.810
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas, and I think it's the ideas

1589
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.550
<v Bart Decrem:>that you will see in Activitypub in

1590
00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Mastodon as well of, um, the idea

1591
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.900
<v Bart Decrem:>behind web 2.0 and the API.

1592
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.520
<v Bart Decrem:>And you can there's these web services

1593
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.630
<v Bart Decrem:>and you have access, you can build

1594
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.190
<v Bart Decrem:>new experience, new user experience, and you

1595
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.880
<v Bart Decrem:>connect them all.

1596
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.410
<v Bart Decrem:>And there's the idea of the social

1597
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.759
<v Bart Decrem:>graph and what are my friends up

1598
00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.390
<v Bart Decrem:>to?

1599
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.549
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we built a web browser

1600
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.430
<v Bart Decrem:>that instead of having a bookmarking tab,

1601
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.900
<v Bart Decrem:>there was a star button.

1602
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the idea was don't do

1603
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.600
<v Bart Decrem:>bookmarking.

1604
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.130
<v Bart Decrem:>That's just click on that star button

1605
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.780
<v Bart Decrem:>when you see something you like.

1606
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:48.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and when you do that we'll

1607
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.860
<v Bart Decrem:>save it up to delicious.

1608
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.310
<v Bart Decrem:>Joshua Schachter's um, social bookmarking service.

1609
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.260
<v Bart Decrem:>So by default, your bookmarks will end

1610
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.300
<v Bart Decrem:>up on on delicious.

1611
00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.550
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and as you're browsing, we have

1612
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Bart Decrem:>a search engine called Lucene into the

1613
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.400
<v Bart Decrem:>browser.

1614
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.680
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we're doing full text indexing

1615
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.180
<v Bart Decrem:>of everything you browse.

1616
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a very good kind of idea.

1617
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

1618
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:10.770
<v Bart Decrem:>And so as you're searching, it'll then

1619
00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.930
<v Bart Decrem:>you start typing into the nav bar

1620
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.510
<v Bart Decrem:>and it'll autocomplete suggestions.

1621
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.860
<v Bart Decrem:>And at the top it's going to

1622
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.330
<v Bart Decrem:>show you stuff that you've looked at

1623
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:18.810
<v Bart Decrem:>before.

1624
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:19.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And then below it it's going to

1625
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.150
<v Bart Decrem:>give you a preview of the top

1626
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.620
<v Bart Decrem:>search hits on Google and so on

1627
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.490
<v Bart Decrem:>and so on.

1628
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.410
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so we had a number of

1629
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:29.340
<v Bart Decrem:>really cool and fresh ideas, mostly around

1630
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.530
<v Bart Decrem:>the social web and things like Flickr

1631
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.740
<v Bart Decrem:>and Delicious, but also around things like

1632
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.259
<v Bart Decrem:>helping people with search and understanding what

1633
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.069
<v Bart Decrem:>you've looked at before and after I

1634
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.180
<v Bart Decrem:>left flock.

1635
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.550
<v Bart Decrem:>Then they really weren't doubled down on

1636
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.560
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of so many, so many features.

1637
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.410
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I would say for my era.

1638
00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Bart Decrem:>So the first 18 months of flock,

1639
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.160
<v Bart Decrem:>we had a lot of good ideas

1640
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.330
<v Bart Decrem:>and we should have shipped three of

1641
00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:55.590
<v Bart Decrem:>them instead of ten of them, you

1642
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.060
<v Bart Decrem:>know, and just really seeing those three

1643
00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.330
<v Bart Decrem:>through, um, uh, that's what I learned

1644
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Bart Decrem:>from that.

1645
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Karen Herman:>So when you it was open source?

1646
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.200
<v Karen Herman:>Yes.

1647
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.430
<v Bart Decrem:>It was fully open source.

1648
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:05.850
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

1649
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.470
<v Karen Herman:>Um, when you when you left flock,

1650
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.029
<v Karen Herman:>though, were you still involved in it

1651
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Karen Herman:>or once you once you leave, you

1652
00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:10.740
<v Karen Herman:>leave.

1653
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.820
<v Bart Decrem:>I got fired.

1654
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.830
<v Karen Herman:>You were the founder.

1655
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.420
<v Bart Decrem:>I have I have this great story

1656
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.040
<v Bart Decrem:>that I that that I've been fired

1657
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.690
<v Bart Decrem:>three times in my life.

1658
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, which, I mean, it's directionally correct.

1659
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.310
<v Bart Decrem:>It's probably technically we can because it's

1660
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.810
<v Bart Decrem:>like I've been fired three times.

1661
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.350
<v Bart Decrem:>I got fired by a VC Once

1662
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.200
<v Bart Decrem:>that was flock, I got fired by

1663
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:30.940
<v Bart Decrem:>a therapist once.

1664
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.110
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, you don't need me anymore.

1665
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Bart Decrem:>You're good.

1666
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.600
<v Bart Decrem:>You don't need to come back next

1667
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:34.960
<v Bart Decrem:>week.

1668
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.580
<v Bart Decrem:>And I got fired by my soccer

1669
00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:37.240
<v Bart Decrem:>coach once.

1670
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.009
<v Bart Decrem:>He was like, nah, you're all set.

1671
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.970
<v Bart Decrem:>You don't need to come back.

1672
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Bart Decrem:>So, you know, those are the three

1673
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.919
<v Bart Decrem:>things I've been fired at.

1674
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.250
<v Bart Decrem:>But.

1675
00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.810
<v Bart Decrem:>But I got fired from flock.

1676
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.900
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I think for good reason.

1677
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.910
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, which is that we shipped a

1678
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:52.360
<v Bart Decrem:>product that wasn't ready, and we missed

1679
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.259
<v Bart Decrem:>our launch window.

1680
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And the moment where we had the

1681
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.740
<v Bart Decrem:>attention, we didn't have a product that

1682
00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.089
<v Bart Decrem:>delivered on that, and that was my

1683
00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:58.570
<v Bart Decrem:>fault.

1684
00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.359
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and a guy, um, named David

1685
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Cowan at Bessemer Venture Partners fired me.

1686
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:04.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And then years later, I ran into

1687
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.080
<v Bart Decrem:>him.

1688
00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.660
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, my friend was like, this

1689
00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.800
<v Bart Decrem:>is the guy that fired me.

1690
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.910
<v Bart Decrem:>And he's like, you're welcome.

1691
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:10.810
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's true.

1692
00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.430
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, like we are, um, I

1693
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:15.100
<v Bart Decrem:>think entrepreneurs, there's probably an exception or

1694
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.500
<v Bart Decrem:>two, but many of us are wildly

1695
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.260
<v Bart Decrem:>flawed, along with some powers that we

1696
00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.010
<v Bart Decrem:>have.

1697
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.170
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the journey of an entrepreneur

1698
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.210
<v Bart Decrem:>is sort of like, for me at

1699
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.190
<v Bart Decrem:>least, becoming clear eyed about what you're

1700
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.320
<v Bart Decrem:>good at and what you're flawed at.

1701
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And that was an important lesson for

1702
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.480
<v Bart Decrem:>me.

1703
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:32.109
<v Karen Herman:>All right.

1704
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.150
<v Karen Herman:>And so, so so you were fired

1705
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:35.410
<v Karen Herman:>from flock and then is that where

1706
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Karen Herman:>Tapulous comes in?

1707
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:40.390
<v Bart Decrem:>It was an EIR at a venture

1708
00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:46.480
<v Bart Decrem:>capital firm, and the iPhone came out.

1709
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.299
<v Bart Decrem:>And I remember Steve Jobs being on

1710
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.970
<v Bart Decrem:>stage in January of 2007.

1711
00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.440
<v Bart Decrem:>That would have been and saying, we

1712
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.140
<v Bart Decrem:>have three products today a phone, a

1713
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.029
<v Bart Decrem:>web browser and an iPod.

1714
00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.170
<v Bart Decrem:>Dun dun dun.

1715
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.580
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, that makes

1716
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.299
<v Bart Decrem:>sense.

1717
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.280
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I was so excited when,

1718
00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:04.930
<v Bart Decrem:>when when they announced the iPhone.

1719
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:05.980
<v Bart Decrem:>So they announced it, I believe Steve

1720
00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.529
<v Bart Decrem:>announced it in January of 2007 and

1721
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Bart Decrem:>then it shipped in, I believe, July

1722
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.830
<v Bart Decrem:>the 1st, June the 30th, actually.

1723
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.509
<v Bart Decrem:>So June the 30th, 2007.

1724
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:15.310
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and as soon as he announced

1725
00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.120
<v Bart Decrem:>it, I was like, that's going to

1726
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:16.450
<v Bart Decrem:>be big.

1727
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:17.649
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to be there.

1728
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so I was noodling around

1729
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.750
<v Bart Decrem:>and interested in that.

1730
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.170
<v Bart Decrem:>And the iPhone came out and within

1731
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.200
<v Bart Decrem:>like a week, people had jailbroken, hacked

1732
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.590
<v Bart Decrem:>open that phone because it only worked

1733
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.230
<v Bart Decrem:>on AT&T in the United States.

1734
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:36.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And there are a lot of people,

1735
00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.450
<v Bart Decrem:>a lot of AT&T, and there's a

1736
00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.470
<v Bart Decrem:>whole lot of people not in the

1737
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:39.160
<v Bart Decrem:>United States.

1738
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.290
<v Bart Decrem:>So within like a month, there was

1739
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.280
<v Bart Decrem:>like, you can go to a website,

1740
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.720
<v Bart Decrem:>jailbreak me or something, you know, dot

1741
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Bart Decrem:>com, and then you click on a

1742
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.319
<v Bart Decrem:>button and voila, your phone now works

1743
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.879
<v Bart Decrem:>in China, you know, or you know,

1744
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.100
<v Bart Decrem:>or on Verizon I believe as well.

1745
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and people started then making jailbreak

1746
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.109
<v Bart Decrem:>apps, you know.

1747
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Bart Decrem:>But this is a year the App

1748
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Store launched a year later in 2008,

1749
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.710
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, in mid-July 2008.

1750
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:04.480
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so as soon as the iPhone

1751
00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.130
<v Bart Decrem:>came out, I was like, this is

1752
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:06.940
<v Bart Decrem:>awesome.

1753
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.530
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to be there and there's

1754
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:09.610
<v Bart Decrem:>going to be apps here.

1755
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was talking to investors that

1756
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.380
<v Bart Decrem:>I wanted to build a company here,

1757
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.400
<v Bart Decrem:>and they were like, what about web

1758
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.640
<v Bart Decrem:>apps?

1759
00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.420
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, no, no, this is

1760
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.319
<v Bart Decrem:>going to be real apps here.

1761
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:18.910
<v Bart Decrem:>This is much better.

1762
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and there was a hacker community.

1763
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.680
<v Bart Decrem:>There were people building hacks.

1764
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.420
<v Bart Decrem:>And I hired a few folks to

1765
00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.279
<v Bart Decrem:>do some prototyping, and I bought a

1766
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.170
<v Bart Decrem:>few apps in the jailbreak days before

1767
00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.370
<v Bart Decrem:>there was an app store.

1768
00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and when when, when?

1769
00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.440
<v Bart Decrem:>And so before the App Store launched,

1770
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.600
<v Bart Decrem:>I raised a little bit of money.

1771
00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.939
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I think it was, like, $1.8

1772
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.920
<v Bart Decrem:>million, I want to say.

1773
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:44.800
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so that came after being

1774
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.230
<v Bart Decrem:>an EIR and been thinking about the

1775
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:50.410
<v Bart Decrem:>world and DCS and seeing Steve Jobs

1776
00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.540
<v Bart Decrem:>on stage and remembering remembering how I

1777
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.799
<v Bart Decrem:>used my phone in Korea.

1778
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.490
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, this thing is

1779
00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:55.270
<v Bart Decrem:>going to be big.

1780
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.100
<v Bart Decrem:>And out of that came came Tapulous

1781
00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:58.180
<v Bart Decrem:>in 2008.

1782
00:53:59.140 --> 00:53:59.650
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

1783
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.569
<v Karen Herman:>Talk about the product that you developed

1784
00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:02.319
<v Karen Herman:>for that.

1785
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.860
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, well, the big idea was, um,

1786
00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.839
<v Bart Decrem:>this is going to be big, and

1787
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.430
<v Bart Decrem:>social networking was already a big thing

1788
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.820
<v Bart Decrem:>at the time.

1789
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:10.600
<v Bart Decrem:>It was like, there's going to be

1790
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.310
<v Bart Decrem:>a social network here.

1791
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.650
<v Bart Decrem:>But instead of it being Facebook Dot,

1792
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.090
<v Bart Decrem:>now they call that Facebook the blue

1793
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:16.810
<v Bart Decrem:>app, you know.

1794
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.279
<v Bart Decrem:>So there being one app that does

1795
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.569
<v Bart Decrem:>a 1000 things, it's going to be

1796
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:20.380
<v Bart Decrem:>ten different apps.

1797
00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.580
<v Bart Decrem:>There's going to be a photo app

1798
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.100
<v Bart Decrem:>and a people app and a and

1799
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.690
<v Bart Decrem:>a chat app and so on.

1800
00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:26.920
<v Bart Decrem:>And then they're all going to be

1801
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.750
<v Bart Decrem:>on the same back end so that

1802
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.340
<v Bart Decrem:>they all your friends, their friends in

1803
00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:30.910
<v Bart Decrem:>one app, their friends.

1804
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.810
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, I'm going to

1805
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:32.890
<v Bart Decrem:>go build all these apps.

1806
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.040
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that was a big thesis

1807
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.959
<v Bart Decrem:>that ended up being correct.

1808
00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, as we were trying to build

1809
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.200
<v Bart Decrem:>that, I was hanging out, you know,

1810
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.089
<v Bart Decrem:>with, with the kids at the super

1811
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.200
<v Bart Decrem:>Happy dev House, you know, like the

1812
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.910
<v Bart Decrem:>hackathons and stuff, you know, and I

1813
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:49.060
<v Bart Decrem:>know.

1814
00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:49.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And then one of the guys I

1815
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:51.040
<v Bart Decrem:>was going to work with was a

1816
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.240
<v Bart Decrem:>guy that worked on flask.

1817
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.310
<v Bart Decrem:>He was his handle, and he was

1818
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:54.819
<v Bart Decrem:>playing this game.

1819
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:56.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, what are you

1820
00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:56.590
<v Bart Decrem:>doing?

1821
00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:57.460
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, I'm playing this game.

1822
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.450
<v Bart Decrem:>It's called Tap Tap Revolution.

1823
00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:59.470
<v Bart Decrem:>It was a jailbreak app and I

1824
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:01.540
<v Bart Decrem:>was like, oh, that's really cool.

1825
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.200
<v Bart Decrem:>What's that?

1826
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:03.340
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, oh yeah, you can download

1827
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.230
<v Bart Decrem:>it on jailbreak app or whatever.

1828
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and install that app.

1829
00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:11.590
<v Bart Decrem:>And I found this developer, Nate True,

1830
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:13.450
<v Bart Decrem:>that had built this sort of killer

1831
00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:15.009
<v Bart Decrem:>app for the jailbreak days.

1832
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.480
<v Bart Decrem:>It was called Tap Tap Revolution.

1833
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Bart Decrem:>and I kept trying to hire him,

1834
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Bart Decrem:>and he didn't want a job.

1835
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Bart Decrem:>Like I was happy sort of feeding

1836
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Bart Decrem:>his parakeets and just doing science experiments,

1837
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Bart Decrem:>you know?

1838
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Bart Decrem:>In Seattle, I love nature.

1839
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:31.470
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, um, um, and and a

1840
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:34.259
<v Bart Decrem:>few months later, my co-founder walked into

1841
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Bart Decrem:>the office and goes like, hey, you

1842
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Bart Decrem:>guys still don't want to work for

1843
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.860
<v Bart Decrem:>us, but he'll sell you his apps

1844
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Bart Decrem:>since you keep calling him.

1845
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.160
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we bought Tap Tap Revenge

1846
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:42.209
<v Bart Decrem:>on a lark.

1847
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and when the App Store launched,

1848
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, we had a couple social apps.

1849
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Bart Decrem:>We had the first Twitter client.

1850
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Bart Decrem:>It was called twinkle.

1851
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Bart Decrem:>We had 1 or 2 other apps.

1852
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but the thing that went to

1853
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Bart Decrem:>number one on the first day of

1854
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Bart Decrem:>the App Store was tap Tap Revenge.

1855
00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:00.060
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there were 553 apps on the

1856
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.190
<v Bart Decrem:>first day of the App Store, and

1857
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Bart Decrem:>there was bejeweled and five other apps,

1858
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Bart Decrem:>five other games that cost like $10

1859
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.740
<v Bart Decrem:>each, you know, and we had this

1860
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Bart Decrem:>simple little game that was high quality.

1861
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Bart Decrem:>There was like really bad tic tac

1862
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.180
<v Bart Decrem:>toe kind of apps, you know?

1863
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Bart Decrem:>So we had the only game one

1864
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.630
<v Bart Decrem:>out of 553 apps, and it was

1865
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.400
<v Bart Decrem:>the only game that was free and

1866
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.750
<v Bart Decrem:>good, compelling.

1867
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Bart Decrem:>And it reminded people of Guitar Hero,

1868
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Bart Decrem:>which was just just towards the end

1869
00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:24.660
<v Bart Decrem:>of the Guitar Hero era of, you

1870
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.529
<v Bart Decrem:>know, that was a big thing at

1871
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:26.040
<v Bart Decrem:>the time.

1872
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so the timing was right, and

1873
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.750
<v Bart Decrem:>a million people had already downloaded it

1874
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.540
<v Bart Decrem:>in jailbreak land before the App Store.

1875
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so we became the first

1876
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:36.959
<v Bart Decrem:>big hit on the App Store.

1877
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.990
<v Bart Decrem:>I'll never forget being on a plane

1878
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.100
<v Bart Decrem:>that first holiday.

1879
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.000
<v Bart Decrem:>So I think this would have been

1880
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.670
<v Bart Decrem:>like the after launched in like September.

1881
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Or maybe it was the after launch

1882
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.759
<v Bart Decrem:>in July, but I remember being on

1883
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.430
<v Bart Decrem:>a plane to go to a family

1884
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:51.240
<v Bart Decrem:>vacation.

1885
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.500
<v Bart Decrem:>And on the plane there were four

1886
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.060
<v Bart Decrem:>people playing Tap Tap Revenge.

1887
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.140
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh wow, this

1888
00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.279
<v Bart Decrem:>is like a this is like a

1889
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.020
<v Bart Decrem:>pop culture phenomenon, you know?

1890
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.270
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so, so we built something that

1891
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:01.560
<v Bart Decrem:>that really worked.

1892
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:03.390
<v Karen Herman:>And did you do.

1893
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.520
<v Karen Herman:>Did you make any changes to it

1894
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.320
<v Karen Herman:>when you bought it or.

1895
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, yeah, when we bought it, I

1896
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.550
<v Bart Decrem:>believe that that revolution was one file.

1897
00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.620
<v Bart Decrem:>It was not.

1898
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:16.910
<v Bart Decrem:>It was not like a beauty of

1899
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:17.570
<v Bart Decrem:>engineering, you know.

1900
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.770
<v Bart Decrem:>It was like something that Nate had

1901
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.870
<v Bart Decrem:>hacked together in an afternoon, which is.

1902
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.339
<v Bart Decrem:>Which is the kind of developer that

1903
00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Andy Hertzfeld had a similar reputation of,

1904
00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:24.620
<v Bart Decrem:>like.

1905
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.220
<v Bart Decrem:>No, no, no.

1906
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Bart Decrem:>These are incredible developers that are creative

1907
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:29.120
<v Bart Decrem:>geniuses.

1908
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

1909
00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:30.470
<v Bart Decrem:>Or just about.

1910
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:33.770
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and they're not engineers.

1911
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.440
<v Bart Decrem:>They're people that hack up cool, exciting

1912
00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.130
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas.

1913
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.899
<v Bart Decrem:>Now, to turn that into products, you're

1914
00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.799
<v Bart Decrem:>going to want to surround them with

1915
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.250
<v Bart Decrem:>other folks.

1916
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:41.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Nate was that kind of

1917
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:42.770
<v Bart Decrem:>guy.

1918
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:44.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so we had to build

1919
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.009
<v Bart Decrem:>a real app, and we had to

1920
00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.839
<v Bart Decrem:>give it a name that wasn't infringing.

1921
00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.270
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and then we had to

1922
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:51.560
<v Bart Decrem:>figure out how to get music into

1923
00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.040
<v Bart Decrem:>it.

1924
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, because startup revolution would connect with

1925
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.690
<v Bart Decrem:>all the songs on your phone.

1926
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:58.009
<v Bart Decrem:>And that was not allowed under the

1927
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Bart Decrem:>App Store SDK.

1928
00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:00.920
<v Bart Decrem:>So we had to go license music

1929
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.660
<v Bart Decrem:>and build a whole content pipeline.

1930
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.650
<v Bart Decrem:>And we had, you know, we had

1931
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:04.910
<v Bart Decrem:>to build the app, but it looked

1932
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:07.460
<v Bart Decrem:>and felt a lot like the original

1933
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:08.690
<v Bart Decrem:>startup revolution.

1934
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.790
<v Karen Herman:>Uh, and we should mention to this,

1935
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:12.470
<v Karen Herman:>this was not open source, right?

1936
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Not open source.

1937
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.259
<v Karen Herman:>Is this the only thing you've done

1938
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.879
<v Karen Herman:>that wasn't open source?

1939
00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:20.810
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it may be.

1940
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.370
<v Bart Decrem:>It may be.

1941
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.110
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm going to say yes, but then

1942
00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:25.820
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm probably going to forget something.

1943
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:26.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, no.

1944
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.529
<v Bart Decrem:>In the I did, I had a

1945
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:29.450
<v Bart Decrem:>little startup called The Hobby, and then

1946
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:30.920
<v Bart Decrem:>in there I did some non-open source

1947
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Bart Decrem:>apps.

1948
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, there's these two things in my

1949
00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:37.250
<v Bart Decrem:>career, sort of across the years for

1950
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.259
<v Bart Decrem:>me that I'm sort of, you know,

1951
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.240
<v Bart Decrem:>like sort of getting more clear on.

1952
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:41.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And then one of them is sort

1953
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of like building a better world, you

1954
00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:45.440
<v Bart Decrem:>know, and being a do gooder.

1955
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.340
<v Bart Decrem:>And then the other one is open

1956
00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.000
<v Bart Decrem:>source.

1957
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:50.330
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I when I started doing Plugged

1958
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:51.650
<v Bart Decrem:>In, I thought it was all about

1959
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.720
<v Bart Decrem:>social impact and building a better world.

1960
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.980
<v Bart Decrem:>And I do like to work on

1961
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:59.240
<v Bart Decrem:>things that are worthy of our time,

1962
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.109
<v Bart Decrem:>our short time we have on this

1963
00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:00.740
<v Bart Decrem:>planet.

1964
00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.779
<v Bart Decrem:>But I'd like to build things.

1965
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.419
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I'm I get excited about

1966
00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:06.290
<v Bart Decrem:>a little game.

1967
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:07.370
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't think I'm the right guy

1968
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.740
<v Bart Decrem:>to do B2B, you know, enterprise software

1969
00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:11.030
<v Bart Decrem:>building, gambling.

1970
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.500
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, like I was listening to

1971
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:13.490
<v Bart Decrem:>something about Polymarket.

1972
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:14.419
<v Bart Decrem:>That's not my kind of thing.

1973
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.589
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't really want to spend my

1974
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:17.060
<v Bart Decrem:>time on that because it's just kind

1975
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:18.230
<v Bart Decrem:>of doesn't feel right to me.

1976
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.580
<v Bart Decrem:>So so so so, so I don't

1977
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.359
<v Bart Decrem:>want to do that.

1978
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but in general, like when I

1979
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Bart Decrem:>was at the Walt Disney Company, I

1980
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Bart Decrem:>was very excited about that.

1981
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.779
<v Bart Decrem:>The idea of social networking, before Facebook

1982
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Bart Decrem:>became sort of the red flag that

1983
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.279
<v Bart Decrem:>it became, uh, was exciting to me

1984
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Bart Decrem:>just as a, as a like, oh,

1985
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Bart Decrem:>wow, you can have a billion people

1986
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:34.819
<v Bart Decrem:>talk to each other.

1987
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.899
<v Bart Decrem:>That's going to make the world more

1988
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Bart Decrem:>connected.

1989
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:36.920
<v Bart Decrem:>That's cool.

1990
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, like and not think much

1991
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Bart Decrem:>deeper than that, honestly, at the time.

1992
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.319
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so and then open source, um,

1993
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:47.960
<v Bart Decrem:>I've always liked open source and still

1994
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Bart Decrem:>do.

1995
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Bart Decrem:>And I also am not so religious

1996
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Bart Decrem:>about it.

1997
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.750
<v Bart Decrem:>And so as we think about open

1998
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Bart Decrem:>source, I'm like, well, what's the right

1999
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Bart Decrem:>license and why am I using the

2000
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Bart Decrem:>GPL?

2001
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.259
<v Bart Decrem:>And then maybe we're using the GPL

2002
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Bart Decrem:>for commercial reasons, not just political reasons,

2003
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.040
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, because there's like when you

2004
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.549
<v Bart Decrem:>have a license that's as restrictive as

2005
01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.980
<v Bart Decrem:>the GPL it gives you, it gives

2006
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.840
<v Bart Decrem:>you corollary powers, you know, as a

2007
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.220
<v Bart Decrem:>person that owns the copyright.

2008
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.870
<v Bart Decrem:>And so every now and then, you

2009
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.339
<v Bart Decrem:>know, it's not that the good, good

2010
01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:19.259
<v Bart Decrem:>guys pick the GPL and the people

2011
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.460
<v Bart Decrem:>that are slightly less good, pick the

2012
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Apache license.

2013
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.770
<v Bart Decrem:>There's commercial considerations that you may want

2014
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.340
<v Bart Decrem:>to go over there.

2015
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.050
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, and frankly, that's what I

2016
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.850
<v Bart Decrem:>did for, for for the Mastodon, for

2017
01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:27.780
<v Bart Decrem:>Mastodon projects.

2018
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so I'm not religious about it.

2019
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.450
<v Bart Decrem:>I do like the idea of the

2020
01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:36.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Commons and people working together and crowdsource

2021
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.870
<v Bart Decrem:>those, you know, and so, so I

2022
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.690
<v Bart Decrem:>love the pirate ship, but I also

2023
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Bart Decrem:>this is the biggest thing I got

2024
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.080
<v Bart Decrem:>from my time at Mozilla.

2025
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.009
<v Bart Decrem:>The reason Firefox took off was that

2026
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.509
<v Bart Decrem:>there was a big idea like a

2027
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Richard Stallman Andy Hertzfeld software should be

2028
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:54.930
<v Bart Decrem:>free, kind of a big idea and

2029
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.569
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of religion and political convention around

2030
01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.640
<v Bart Decrem:>Webster, you know, conviction around web standards

2031
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.660
<v Bart Decrem:>and the open internet.

2032
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.040
<v Bart Decrem:>And everybody should be able to build.

2033
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And we don't have gatekeepers.

2034
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:04.950
<v Bart Decrem:>There was a whole ideology there that

2035
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:06.510
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm like, yes, yes, yes, I believe

2036
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:07.950
<v Bart Decrem:>in all of that, you know.

2037
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.190
<v Bart Decrem:>But also there was like a commitment

2038
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.710
<v Bart Decrem:>to winning and a definition of winning

2039
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:16.140
<v Bart Decrem:>that was a billion people.

2040
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.870
<v Bart Decrem:>And and that's how I'm wired.

2041
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.800
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I want to build stuff that

2042
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.200
<v Bart Decrem:>has good values, you know, and comports

2043
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Bart Decrem:>with a charter, you know, and ideals.

2044
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.690
<v Bart Decrem:>But I want to hit the mainstream

2045
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.360
<v Bart Decrem:>because a product and in the Mastodon

2046
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.129
<v Bart Decrem:>world in particular, many people don't feel

2047
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.750
<v Bart Decrem:>like that, but I do.

2048
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, if you really want to make

2049
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.040
<v Bart Decrem:>a dent in the universe, you got

2050
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.390
<v Bart Decrem:>to touch as many people as possible.

2051
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.560
<v Bart Decrem:>And when you're just touching a thousand

2052
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.600
<v Bart Decrem:>people, that's a club.

2053
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.120
<v Bart Decrem:>But that's not really changing the landscape.

2054
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.190
<v Bart Decrem:>And so with Firefox, there was there

2055
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.319
<v Bart Decrem:>was Mitchell and Brendan and Ben.

2056
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.360
<v Bart Decrem:>They all wanted to win.

2057
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.890
<v Bart Decrem:>We wanted to I wanted to have

2058
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.000
<v Bart Decrem:>$1 million in the bank and then

2059
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:57.479
<v Bart Decrem:>$2 million.

2060
01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.430
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's a competitive thing, right?

2061
01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.020
<v Bart Decrem:>But you need that to keep the

2062
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.400
<v Bart Decrem:>lights on and to pay people, you

2063
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.330
<v Bart Decrem:>know, so that they can do good

2064
01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:03.990
<v Bart Decrem:>work.

2065
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think Mitchell wanted to get

2066
01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:06.509
<v Bart Decrem:>to 100 million users.

2067
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:09.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And Brendan would sit there and look

2068
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.500
<v Bart Decrem:>at I remember that there would be

2069
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.830
<v Bart Decrem:>these, you know, check in reviews, PR

2070
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.580
<v Bart Decrem:>reviews every day.

2071
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.530
<v Bart Decrem:>And they'd be like, all right, this

2072
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:17.550
<v Bart Decrem:>is the web standards.

2073
01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.600
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, these are the standards and

2074
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Bart Decrem:>the definitions and the values.

2075
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Bart Decrem:>But CNN.com is not loading.

2076
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2077
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Bart Decrem:>In Firefox we got to go fix

2078
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

2079
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Or you know somebody there that you

2080
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Bart Decrem:>can call to go fix their website.

2081
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Please go call them.

2082
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Bart Decrem:>But if you don't I'm going to

2083
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Bart Decrem:>make it.

2084
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Bart Decrem:>So I'm going to go hack it

2085
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Bart Decrem:>so that there's a allowlist a whitelist.

2086
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Bart Decrem:>We call them at the time in

2087
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox.

2088
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And we're going to we're going to

2089
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Bart Decrem:>support some non-standard behaviors so that CNN

2090
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.420
<v Bart Decrem:>works on Firefox.

2091
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Bart Decrem:>Because if CNN doesn't work on Firefox,

2092
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Bart Decrem:>why would your grandma then your grandma

2093
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Bart Decrem:>can't use it.

2094
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Bart Decrem:>So there was a pragmatism combined with

2095
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Bart Decrem:>conviction and core values and a willingness

2096
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Bart Decrem:>to negotiate.

2097
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's very hard because you're getting

2098
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Bart Decrem:>your hands dirty, right?

2099
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:59.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Because you're like, oh, I'm supporting the

2100
01:02:59.520 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Bart Decrem:>devil.

2101
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm Acrobat works in my browser, whatever

2102
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Bart Decrem:>the devil looks like at that particular

2103
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.080
<v Bart Decrem:>point in time.

2104
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2105
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.420
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm doing it because I want to

2106
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Bart Decrem:>get to a billion users.

2107
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Bart Decrem:>But but I'm being thoughtful about it

2108
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Bart Decrem:>and deliberate about that.

2109
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Bart Decrem:>And, you know, and I have a

2110
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Bart Decrem:>plan for, you know, saying waving goodbye

2111
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Bart Decrem:>to the devil.

2112
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:15.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2113
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Bart Decrem:>Or no longer supporting Acrobat five years

2114
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Bart Decrem:>later and so on and so on.

2115
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Bart Decrem:>And I think that was the superpower

2116
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.529
<v Bart Decrem:>of of early Mozilla Foundation.

2117
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:24.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And the Firefox story is that we

2118
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Bart Decrem:>were able to combine values and principles

2119
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Bart Decrem:>around open source and open internet and,

2120
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.259
<v Bart Decrem:>and power to the people.

2121
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:35.670
<v Bart Decrem:>Combine that with technology and pragmatism featured

2122
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Bart Decrem:>in the web browser, where Google would

2123
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Bart Decrem:>just say, no, he was just he

2124
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.169
<v Bart Decrem:>would just throw out features all day

2125
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Bart Decrem:>long.

2126
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.600
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, no, no, it makes something

2127
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Bart Decrem:>because he understood that every feature you

2128
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Bart Decrem:>add makes the product more complicated.

2129
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Bart Decrem:>Boy, open source people really don't understand

2130
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Bart Decrem:>the cost, you know, of a of

2131
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.510
<v Bart Decrem:>a shortcut or something in the settings.

2132
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Bart Decrem:>Everything has a cost.

2133
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, we are very good at that.

2134
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.750
<v Bart Decrem:>In in the Firefox 100 days.

2135
01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:00.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so as I think about

2136
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of my personal values and open

2137
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Bart Decrem:>source and why wasn't that so?

2138
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't know.

2139
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Bart Decrem:>I didn't see a particular reason why

2140
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.720
<v Bart Decrem:>that was going to be good for

2141
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Bart Decrem:>the world or good for our business.

2142
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Bart Decrem:>And so it wasn't.

2143
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2144
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.770
<v Karen Herman:>You did.

2145
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Karen Herman:>You mentioned, you know, being in the

2146
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.230
<v Karen Herman:>mainstream.

2147
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:15.540
<v Karen Herman:>And so tapulous and you really were

2148
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.310
<v Karen Herman:>acquired by Disney, which is you can't

2149
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Karen Herman:>get much more mainstream than that.

2150
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.649
<v Karen Herman:>Talk about that.

2151
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Karen Herman:>How did that come about?

2152
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.109
<v Karen Herman:>How did you feel about it?

2153
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.839
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah, I loved working at Disney for

2154
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.390
<v Bart Decrem:>the most part, and the reason that

2155
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Bart Decrem:>I personally loved it is that, uh,

2156
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, I don't think most people

2157
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.390
<v Bart Decrem:>wouldn't bet that Bart will do well

2158
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Bart Decrem:>in fortune 100 sort of company setting,

2159
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:35.880
<v Bart Decrem:>you know?

2160
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but the Walt Disney Company,

2161
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.149
<v Bart Decrem:>they work with creative talent.

2162
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I walked into a company

2163
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.370
<v Bart Decrem:>where there was, um, there was Pixar,

2164
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Bart Decrem:>and there were lots of other organizations

2165
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Bart Decrem:>and divisions that were really driven by

2166
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.620
<v Bart Decrem:>creators and creative visionaries and that really

2167
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.200
<v Bart Decrem:>that really led with the quality of

2168
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Bart Decrem:>the vision and the product and the

2169
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.260
<v Bart Decrem:>story that was being told.

2170
01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:58.840
<v Bart Decrem:>um.

2171
01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.160
<v Bart Decrem:>My boss was a guy named John

2172
01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.980
<v Bart Decrem:>Pleasants, um, who ended up, went on

2173
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:05.380
<v Bart Decrem:>to be the co-founder of peloton, uh,

2174
01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.180
<v Bart Decrem:>and really gave me a lot of

2175
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.589
<v Bart Decrem:>I remember going to like, I'm not

2176
01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:09.069
<v Bart Decrem:>happy here.

2177
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:09.640
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like, why not?

2178
01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:10.570
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, because I'm spending all my day

2179
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:11.649
<v Bart Decrem:>in meetings, like, well, then don't go

2180
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:13.120
<v Bart Decrem:>to meetings, just try to ship a

2181
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:13.780
<v Bart Decrem:>good game.

2182
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.860
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, oh, I can do

2183
01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.550
<v Bart Decrem:>that here.

2184
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.080
<v Bart Decrem:>And then Bob Iger would do the

2185
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.560
<v Bart Decrem:>same thing.

2186
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:19.299
<v Bart Decrem:>Who's still he's once again the CEO

2187
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Bart Decrem:>at Disney now.

2188
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.730
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but so the Walt Disney Company

2189
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.799
<v Bart Decrem:>they kind of treated me as talent

2190
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Bart Decrem:>and at Disney at the time.

2191
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And I'm pretty sure still today talent.

2192
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Bart Decrem:>If you had to pick between the

2193
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Bart Decrem:>MBA with the management chops and the

2194
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:34.840
<v Bart Decrem:>talent, with the creative vision that can

2195
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Bart Decrem:>tell a story and bring it into

2196
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Bart Decrem:>the world, that person would get at

2197
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Bart Decrem:>least as much, you know, listening time

2198
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Bart Decrem:>and power.

2199
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:43.899
<v Bart Decrem:>So it was a place that valued,

2200
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Bart Decrem:>um, uh, creators.

2201
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.450
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was sort of put into

2202
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Bart Decrem:>that bucket, uh, and was able to

2203
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Bart Decrem:>focus on building great games.

2204
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.759
<v Bart Decrem:>Where's my water is what came out

2205
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Bart Decrem:>of that, a billion users.

2206
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I love the Walt Disney

2207
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Bart Decrem:>Company because you would go to the

2208
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Bart Decrem:>park, and it is such a beautiful

2209
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Bart Decrem:>part of the American story and American

2210
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Bart Decrem:>culture, and sort of where Americans of

2211
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.620
<v Bart Decrem:>all stripes go.

2212
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Bart Decrem:>It's kind of like the Obama speech.

2213
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.259
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, there's so much more that

2214
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Bart Decrem:>brings us together in common than what

2215
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Bart Decrem:>separates us.

2216
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:13.149
<v Bart Decrem:>But that's what it's like to go

2217
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Bart Decrem:>to Disneyland, like all of America comes

2218
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.810
<v Bart Decrem:>together, and I'm European, so I don't

2219
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.279
<v Bart Decrem:>love all of sort of, you know,

2220
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:19.029
<v Bart Decrem:>Americana.

2221
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:19.480
<v Bart Decrem:>Right?

2222
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.669
<v Bart Decrem:>But but you would run into folks

2223
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:23.050
<v Bart Decrem:>in the park and you'd be like,

2224
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, people that work there and

2225
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:26.200
<v Bart Decrem:>are selling, you know, popcorn.

2226
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Bart Decrem:>And they're like, I've been working here

2227
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Bart Decrem:>for 20 years.

2228
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And, you know, I love our guests.

2229
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Bart Decrem:>And and they would talk about what

2230
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Bart Decrem:>the company means to them and how

2231
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Bart Decrem:>big a fan they are.

2232
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Bart Decrem:>And then you would run into folks

2233
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Bart Decrem:>that are visiting the park and, and

2234
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Bart Decrem:>you would realize this is part of

2235
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.250
<v Bart Decrem:>the American story and a beautiful part

2236
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Bart Decrem:>for the most part.

2237
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.529
<v Bart Decrem:>And then Bob Iger is a very

2238
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.190
<v Bart Decrem:>good CEO.

2239
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And he would talk about the business

2240
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Bart Decrem:>language he would use would be around

2241
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Bart Decrem:>brand deposits and brand withdrawals.

2242
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2243
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.210
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like, hey, we're the Walt Disney

2244
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:49.810
<v Bart Decrem:>Company.

2245
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Bart Decrem:>And when we're selling a whole bunch

2246
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.100
<v Bart Decrem:>of t shirts at Walmart, that might

2247
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.750
<v Bart Decrem:>be a brand branch withdrawal where we're

2248
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Bart Decrem:>doing.

2249
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Bart Decrem:>He wouldn't say it like that, but

2250
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:58.270
<v Bart Decrem:>like, you're kind of cheapening the brand

2251
01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.259
<v Bart Decrem:>a little bit to make another buck

2252
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Bart Decrem:>and to hit your quarterly objectives, you

2253
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Bart Decrem:>know.

2254
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Bart Decrem:>And you would do some of that

2255
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Bart Decrem:>every now and then.

2256
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.350
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2257
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but he's like, but are we

2258
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Bart Decrem:>doing enough?

2259
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Bart Decrem:>Are we making enough brand deposits?

2260
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.410
<v Bart Decrem:>Are we investing in new stories, not

2261
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:10.509
<v Bart Decrem:>just doing another franchise, you know, update?

2262
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:13.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, are we leading with a creative

2263
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.870
<v Bart Decrem:>vision?

2264
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:14.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Enough.

2265
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, are we leading with values

2266
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.790
<v Bart Decrem:>and really trying to build magical experiences

2267
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:19.360
<v Bart Decrem:>enough.

2268
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that's me, right?

2269
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.650
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, it's like the values and the

2270
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:24.670
<v Bart Decrem:>pragmatism.

2271
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.799
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so I thought this was

2272
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Bart Decrem:>really special.

2273
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And I got to help introduce Disney

2274
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Bart Decrem:>to a new generation by putting Mickey

2275
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Bart Decrem:>Mouse and Where's My Water game?

2276
01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:35.710
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was a really good game.

2277
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and and it was great.

2278
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.160
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2279
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.939
<v Karen Herman:>Did they really?

2280
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Karen Herman:>Did you have to focus on their

2281
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Karen Herman:>intellectual property or could you could, you

2282
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Karen Herman:>know, I could do.

2283
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.170
<v Bart Decrem:>Whatever I want.

2284
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, what happened was the law, at

2285
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Bart Decrem:>least, was that Steve Jobs was on

2286
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Bart Decrem:>the board of Disney and was not

2287
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.490
<v Bart Decrem:>not excited about the first wave of

2288
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:52.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Disney apps.

2289
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, you got to go.

2290
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Bart Decrem:>You got to go find some Silicon

2291
01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.149
<v Bart Decrem:>Valley talent that knows how to build

2292
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Bart Decrem:>apps and that we required as part

2293
01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:57.759
<v Bart Decrem:>of that.

2294
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.160
<v Bart Decrem:>So I ended up running a smartphone

2295
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.960
<v Bart Decrem:>games for The Walt Disney Company for

2296
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Bart Decrem:>four years, three and a half years.

2297
01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I remember going around the

2298
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Bart Decrem:>company and I was like, I'm looking

2299
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Bart Decrem:>for the next banker because I remembered

2300
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.040
<v Bart Decrem:>shipping Firefox, you know, and what that

2301
01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.690
<v Bart Decrem:>felt like to have product market fit,

2302
01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Bart Decrem:>led by a visionary, uh, person that

2303
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:21.819
<v Bart Decrem:>could express ideas and curate experiences.

2304
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:23.950
<v Bart Decrem:>And we found them and it was,

2305
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:27.040
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, Tim Fitzrandolph who was sitting somewhere

2306
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.720
<v Bart Decrem:>in a studio in Glendale.

2307
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.729
<v Bart Decrem:>And because he spoke Japanese, I think

2308
01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.800
<v Bart Decrem:>he was in charge of Japanese localization

2309
01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.890
<v Bart Decrem:>for, um, console gaming for for the

2310
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.660
<v Bart Decrem:>Disney gaming business at the time.

2311
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.849
<v Bart Decrem:>And he had built a game, a

2312
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.670
<v Bart Decrem:>physics game on the App Store called

2313
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.019
<v Bart Decrem:>the name is escaping right now.

2314
01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.429
<v Bart Decrem:>But he'd had a number one game

2315
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.540
<v Bart Decrem:>on the App Store.

2316
01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:48.639
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, that was just in his personal

2317
01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.269
<v Bart Decrem:>name was a free game.

2318
01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:50.140
<v Bart Decrem:>It didn't make any money off of

2319
01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:50.470
<v Bart Decrem:>it.

2320
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:51.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, well, who's that

2321
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:52.479
<v Bart Decrem:>guy?

2322
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:53.050
<v Bart Decrem:>What are you.

2323
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.160
<v Bart Decrem:>Hey, Tim, come over here.

2324
01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:54.670
<v Bart Decrem:>What do you want to work?

2325
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.990
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, oh, I have this physics

2326
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:57.609
<v Bart Decrem:>thing, you know, and it looks like

2327
01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:57.790
<v Bart Decrem:>this.

2328
01:08:57.819 --> 01:08:58.660
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, cool.

2329
01:08:58.810 --> 01:08:59.500
<v Bart Decrem:>Who's doing that?

2330
01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:03.310
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like, um, it's an alligator that

2331
01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:05.950
<v Bart Decrem:>needs to get water because he's thirsty

2332
01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:07.330
<v Bart Decrem:>and needs to take a shower.

2333
01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:08.439
<v Bart Decrem:>And like, okay.

2334
01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:11.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And I remember like a week before

2335
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.479
<v Bart Decrem:>we shipped it, talking to my to

2336
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:15.040
<v Bart Decrem:>John, my boss, who was at an

2337
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.260
<v Bart Decrem:>offsite with Bob Iger and them.

2338
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.020
<v Bart Decrem:>He's like I met I met I

2339
01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.500
<v Bart Decrem:>met the Disney um uh, the park

2340
01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:25.899
<v Bart Decrem:>the Animal Adventures Park, Animal Kingdom in

2341
01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:28.330
<v Bart Decrem:>Florida with the board of directors here

2342
01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.050
<v Bart Decrem:>and with Bob.

2343
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:30.609
<v Bart Decrem:>And I'm looking down on the pond

2344
01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:32.439
<v Bart Decrem:>and there's alligators below me, and they

2345
01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.180
<v Bart Decrem:>look like they want to eat me.

2346
01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Why is your lead character an alligator?

2347
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.769
<v Bart Decrem:>Why can't you just be like, oh,

2348
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.510
<v Bart Decrem:>we need you for something, right?

2349
01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.639
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, no, it's an

2350
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.420
<v Bart Decrem:>alligator.

2351
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.620
<v Bart Decrem:>It's been decided.

2352
01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:45.429
<v Bart Decrem:>Don't worry about it.

2353
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Bart Decrem:>And we just stuck to our guns

2354
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.920
<v Bart Decrem:>and the company led us.

2355
01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:49.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but it was that same idea

2356
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.270
<v Bart Decrem:>of like, no, Ben gets to pick

2357
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.440
<v Bart Decrem:>the name Firefox at the end of

2358
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:53.700
<v Bart Decrem:>the day because it's his thing, you

2359
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.029
<v Bart Decrem:>know?

2360
01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.270
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Tim Fitzrandolph Where's My Water

2361
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.530
<v Bart Decrem:>was his idea.

2362
01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:00.390
<v Bart Decrem:>And part of that idea is a

2363
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:02.340
<v Bart Decrem:>mechanic, you know, drilling, you know, cutting

2364
01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.390
<v Bart Decrem:>through water.

2365
01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:05.009
<v Bart Decrem:>And then part of it is the

2366
01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:06.000
<v Bart Decrem:>story around that.

2367
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.170
<v Bart Decrem:>And so you get to you get

2368
01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.160
<v Bart Decrem:>to name that character.

2369
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.380
<v Bart Decrem:>And so that was that's as a

2370
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.580
<v Bart Decrem:>manager, it's sort of the same as

2371
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.230
<v Bart Decrem:>in the Graham Foundation kind of world.

2372
01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.429
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like all I'm doing is I'm

2373
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:16.860
<v Bart Decrem:>just protecting the creator, you know, in

2374
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:18.660
<v Bart Decrem:>that in that early stage, as you're

2375
01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.950
<v Bart Decrem:>going from 0 to 1, as Peter

2376
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.770
<v Bart Decrem:>Thiel would say, um, and protecting them

2377
01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:23.970
<v Bart Decrem:>and supporting them.

2378
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.380
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and that's sort of all I

2379
01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.759
<v Bart Decrem:>do, but that's important, you know.

2380
01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.950
<v Karen Herman:>How long were you there at Disney?

2381
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:30.480
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, three and a half years.

2382
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.759
<v Karen Herman:>And why did you leave?

2383
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.120
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it was time to reorg and

2384
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.900
<v Bart Decrem:>manage.

2385
01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and I felt like, well, now

2386
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:41.490
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm spilling all my days in budget

2387
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.390
<v Bart Decrem:>meetings.

2388
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and the reason was that when

2389
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:48.800
<v Bart Decrem:>I was acquired, when our little startup

2390
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Bart Decrem:>was acquired, it was the first generation

2391
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.929
<v Bart Decrem:>of the App Store, which was about

2392
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Bart Decrem:>free downloads and 99 cent games.

2393
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And what happens as I was at

2394
01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Disney is social gaming happened and social

2395
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Bart Decrem:>gaming was, um, what you would call

2396
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.809
<v Bart Decrem:>the free to play games.

2397
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And they were free downloads and in-app

2398
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Bart Decrem:>upsells, and they are gaming systems that

2399
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.370
<v Bart Decrem:>I've just never loved.

2400
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:18.380
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and it's around, um, driving engagement

2401
01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.980
<v Bart Decrem:>and, and building game systems that put

2402
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:23.690
<v Bart Decrem:>roadblocks at strategic points.

2403
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.309
<v Bart Decrem:>Just when you're, like, getting ready to,

2404
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.839
<v Bart Decrem:>like, get to the next level.

2405
01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.220
<v Bart Decrem:>Now there's a financial roadblock where you

2406
01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.510
<v Bart Decrem:>need to pay $8 or whatever it

2407
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.960
<v Bart Decrem:>is.

2408
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:31.519
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, and then

2409
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.770
<v Bart Decrem:>you'd hire folks that have worked in

2410
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.809
<v Bart Decrem:>Vegas in the casino context, and then

2411
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:37.100
<v Bart Decrem:>they would go work at Facebook, and

2412
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.660
<v Bart Decrem:>they're working on push notifications, and then

2413
01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.890
<v Bart Decrem:>they're working on social games.

2414
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.420
<v Bart Decrem:>It's all the same stuff.

2415
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:43.400
<v Bart Decrem:>Their engagement systems, you know, whether it's

2416
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Vegas or social networking apps or free

2417
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.669
<v Bart Decrem:>to play games.

2418
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, that just wasn't where my heart

2419
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Bart Decrem:>was.

2420
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Bart Decrem:>And when you have a thing, that's

2421
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:55.349
<v Bart Decrem:>one thing.

2422
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Bart Decrem:>It's very hard to transplant that into

2423
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Bart Decrem:>another thing.

2424
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Bart Decrem:>So like, where's my water game with

2425
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.900
<v Bart Decrem:>a billion people?

2426
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Bart Decrem:>That was amazing.

2427
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.170
<v Bart Decrem:>But that would be maybe $40 million

2428
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Bart Decrem:>a year in revenue.

2429
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Bart Decrem:>But Clash of Clans would be like,

2430
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.370
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't know, $2 billion a year

2431
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Bart Decrem:>of revenue within like year one, right?

2432
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Bart Decrem:>So then you're like, well, how can

2433
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:13.290
<v Bart Decrem:>I make this game with a billion

2434
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Bart Decrem:>users and make it behave like that

2435
01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:16.050
<v Bart Decrem:>game over there, you know?

2436
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.460
<v Bart Decrem:>So then where's my water will be

2437
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.960
<v Bart Decrem:>bringing in $4 billion a year or

2438
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Bart Decrem:>whatever.

2439
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.920
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

2440
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, it's very hard to do because

2441
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:23.670
<v Bart Decrem:>you've set the DNA of the thing

2442
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.889
<v Bart Decrem:>and the team, and we tried and

2443
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:27.840
<v Bart Decrem:>we failed, and it just wasn't my

2444
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:32.100
<v Bart Decrem:>thing that I so much of gaming,

2445
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.469
<v Bart Decrem:>especially casual gaming and gaming on social

2446
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Bart Decrem:>apps and so on and so on,

2447
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.929
<v Bart Decrem:>it's all free to play.

2448
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Bart Decrem:>And I really enjoyed, you know, cut

2449
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Bart Decrem:>the rope and Where's my water and

2450
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Bart Decrem:>tap tap revenge.

2451
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.410
<v Bart Decrem:>He's sort of like, I don't know,

2452
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.170
<v Bart Decrem:>moments of delights that aren't trying to

2453
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.060
<v Bart Decrem:>monetize every second of your attention, you

2454
01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.510
<v Bart Decrem:>know?

2455
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.589
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2456
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.660
<v Karen Herman:>And then is that when you founded

2457
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.920
<v Karen Herman:>the hobby?

2458
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:53.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

2459
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:54.740
<v Bart Decrem:>I went fishing, and then I had

2460
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:55.880
<v Bart Decrem:>a couple of app ideas, and I

2461
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.220
<v Bart Decrem:>called our investor and I was like,

2462
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.030
<v Bart Decrem:>hey, I think I want to do

2463
01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.500
<v Bart Decrem:>a thing, and I could use a

2464
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.879
<v Bart Decrem:>couple of million dollars, and people seem

2465
01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.690
<v Bart Decrem:>to want to invest in it.

2466
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:05.450
<v Bart Decrem:>But but how do I let them

2467
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.900
<v Bart Decrem:>know that?

2468
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.210
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like, these are like ideas that

2469
01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:10.250
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm messing around with, you know, like

2470
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.049
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm not fully committed in the way

2471
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:13.250
<v Bart Decrem:>that I was when I was like,

2472
01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.840
<v Bart Decrem:>oh, call it the hobby.

2473
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.760
<v Bart Decrem:>That way people will not be mistaken.

2474
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.630
<v Bart Decrem:>This is your hobby.

2475
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:19.130
<v Bart Decrem:>It's a side project that they're investing

2476
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.550
<v Bart Decrem:>in.

2477
01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.130
<v Bart Decrem:>I forgot about reverse psychology, which is

2478
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:23.960
<v Bart Decrem:>when you call the thing the hobby,

2479
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:25.490
<v Bart Decrem:>then that's a really good way to

2480
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.180
<v Bart Decrem:>start FOMO.

2481
01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.350
<v Bart Decrem:>And people really want to be part

2482
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.920
<v Bart Decrem:>of that.

2483
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:29.510
<v Bart Decrem:>So we so I started a company

2484
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:31.240
<v Bart Decrem:>called The Hobby and we built 3

2485
01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.360
<v Bart Decrem:>or 4 different apps.

2486
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.650
<v Bart Decrem:>They all failed.

2487
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:34.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Um.

2488
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Building businesses around apps by that time

2489
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.330
<v Bart Decrem:>was much, much, much, much harder than

2490
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.290
<v Bart Decrem:>in the early days.

2491
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:43.610
<v Bart Decrem:>So, you know, it's sort of my

2492
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:44.660
<v Bart Decrem:>pattern recognition being off.

2493
01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.710
<v Bart Decrem:>It's probably part of it.

2494
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.259
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I don't think I was committed

2495
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.340
<v Bart Decrem:>enough to them.

2496
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.839
<v Bart Decrem:>I mean, I was more excited about

2497
01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.960
<v Bart Decrem:>building the thing than getting users for

2498
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.670
<v Bart Decrem:>the thing and finding product market fit.

2499
01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.890
<v Bart Decrem:>Like we should tap Tap revenge.

2500
01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.670
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, when Ben and us shipped

2501
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Firefox, there's a thing we wanted to

2502
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:06.320
<v Bart Decrem:>build, and we brought it out and

2503
01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.580
<v Bart Decrem:>it found product market fit.

2504
01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.559
<v Bart Decrem:>And then we just organized that energy

2505
01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.120
<v Bart Decrem:>and we just harvested that energy and

2506
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.560
<v Bart Decrem:>focused it a little bit, you know.

2507
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And same with Tap Tap Revenge.

2508
01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.870
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, when you have real product

2509
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.820
<v Bart Decrem:>market fit, it's like there's the thing

2510
01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.500
<v Bart Decrem:>and you're just harvesting the energy and

2511
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.640
<v Bart Decrem:>just keeping the sanity a little bit.

2512
01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.670
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, um, in the real world,

2513
01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.769
<v Bart Decrem:>product market fit is something that probably

2514
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.270
<v Bart Decrem:>going to take you in most, most

2515
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:27.320
<v Bart Decrem:>cases, it's going to take you years

2516
01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.540
<v Bart Decrem:>and years of like just just hard

2517
01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.370
<v Bart Decrem:>times to discover, you know, like one

2518
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:32.540
<v Bart Decrem:>phone call at a time, kind of

2519
01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.320
<v Bart Decrem:>a thing.

2520
01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.630
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, that's hard.

2521
01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, like Jessica who are engineering had

2522
01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:38.660
<v Bart Decrem:>from tap.

2523
01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.670
<v Bart Decrem:>She was like, Dude, it's hard to

2524
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.410
<v Bart Decrem:>be doing a startup after Tapulous because,

2525
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.730
<v Bart Decrem:>like, we would literally get 10 million

2526
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.470
<v Bart Decrem:>downloads, you know, like, you know, like

2527
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.060
<v Bart Decrem:>on a big day and then you're

2528
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.080
<v Bart Decrem:>like, I got a startup, I got

2529
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.700
<v Bart Decrem:>my first 14 downloads.

2530
01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.020
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, it's very hard to get

2531
01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:52.380
<v Bart Decrem:>excited about.

2532
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.460
<v Bart Decrem:>So I think part of the reason

2533
01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.589
<v Bart Decrem:>the hobby failed is that I just

2534
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:57.059
<v Bart Decrem:>wanted to build that great product that

2535
01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.230
<v Bart Decrem:>takes care of itself.

2536
01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.670
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, once you set it out,

2537
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.830
<v Bart Decrem:>that just is a thing that happens

2538
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.000
<v Bart Decrem:>once every ten years, you know?

2539
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:05.190
<v Bart Decrem:>And so no matter how there's like

2540
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.450
<v Bart Decrem:>two inches two entrepreneurs that are the

2541
01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:06.809
<v Bart Decrem:>exception.

2542
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:08.550
<v Bart Decrem:>But for most of us, even if

2543
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Bart Decrem:>your timing is right and so on

2544
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:13.710
<v Bart Decrem:>and so on, it takes hard labor

2545
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.540
<v Bart Decrem:>to find product market fit, and you

2546
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.860
<v Bart Decrem:>need to do a lot of listening

2547
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.509
<v Bart Decrem:>and changing course and all that kind

2548
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.290
<v Bart Decrem:>of stuff.

2549
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.670
<v Bart Decrem:>I don't think I was committed enough

2550
01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.680
<v Bart Decrem:>to do that in the hobby, based

2551
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.480
<v Bart Decrem:>on my pattern recognition from Firefox, and

2552
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Bart Decrem:>I got spoiled.

2553
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.820
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah, but you did.

2554
01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.120
<v Karen Herman:>You did.

2555
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:28.050
<v Karen Herman:>One of the one of the things

2556
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:31.170
<v Karen Herman:>was a music livestream platform.

2557
01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:31.860
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2558
01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:32.550
<v Karen Herman:>And that was good.

2559
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.970
<v Karen Herman:>That was a good.

2560
01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:33.600
<v Karen Herman:>That was a.

2561
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Good hustle.

2562
01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:34.620
<v Karen Herman:>Group.

2563
01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:36.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2564
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.550
<v Bart Decrem:>Live streaming never quite got as big,

2565
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.919
<v Bart Decrem:>although that it you know, I mean

2566
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.050
<v Bart Decrem:>Twitch was there and then Twitch has

2567
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:44.639
<v Bart Decrem:>continued to be there and do well.

2568
01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.080
<v Bart Decrem:>And you know, AOC and Tim Walz

2569
01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:46.710
<v Bart Decrem:>and all that kind of stuff.

2570
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:48.090
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a thing, right?

2571
01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.010
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but live streaming for musicians.

2572
01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:54.330
<v Bart Decrem:>I've always liked music.

2573
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:56.160
<v Bart Decrem:>You can tell by my background.

2574
01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:56.910
<v Bart Decrem:>Um.

2575
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.540
<v Bart Decrem:>It's hard to make money in music.

2576
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.589
<v Bart Decrem:>That's the thing.

2577
01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.240
<v Bart Decrem:>I got lucky with that, that I

2578
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.080
<v Bart Decrem:>found a way to make money in

2579
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.950
<v Bart Decrem:>music once.

2580
01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.450
<v Bart Decrem:>They probably made me think I could

2581
01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:07.230
<v Bart Decrem:>do it a second time.

2582
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And that may not be true.

2583
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Um.

2584
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.549
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there's, like, an irrational optimism involved

2585
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:12.870
<v Bart Decrem:>in being an entrepreneur, you know?

2586
01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.570
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but it's hard.

2587
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.800
<v Bart Decrem:>I think this I think it might

2588
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:18.570
<v Bart Decrem:>have been John Lilly or Josh Elman.

2589
01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.820
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it was Josh Elman, a

2590
01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:23.370
<v Bart Decrem:>famous, uh, well known venture capitalist and

2591
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.180
<v Bart Decrem:>entrepreneur.

2592
01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:27.750
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I remember him telling me

2593
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.770
<v Bart Decrem:>he's like, look, if Keith Richards knocked

2594
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.180
<v Bart Decrem:>on your door and crashed on your

2595
01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.370
<v Bart Decrem:>living room, you'd be so excited.

2596
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.420
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, if he'd pulled out his

2597
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.100
<v Bart Decrem:>guitar and started playing guitar.

2598
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.690
<v Bart Decrem:>If he does it again the second

2599
01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:40.800
<v Bart Decrem:>day, he'll be a little bit less

2600
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.640
<v Bart Decrem:>excited.

2601
01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:43.740
<v Bart Decrem:>If he's still there 60 days later

2602
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:45.000
<v Bart Decrem:>playing the guitar, you don't want this

2603
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.260
<v Bart Decrem:>guy out of your house because he's

2604
01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.550
<v Bart Decrem:>like, too annoying and you want to

2605
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:48.150
<v Bart Decrem:>sleep.

2606
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:50.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, this is the problem with with

2607
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.780
<v Bart Decrem:>live streaming is that it's all about

2608
01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.450
<v Bart Decrem:>scarcity of the moment, and then you

2609
01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.920
<v Bart Decrem:>somehow need to replicate that.

2610
01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.290
<v Bart Decrem:>So you find a great musician and

2611
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:02.519
<v Bart Decrem:>they do a concert, and they had

2612
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.320
<v Bart Decrem:>a beautiful experience and 50 people showed

2613
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:04.950
<v Bart Decrem:>up.

2614
01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:09.059
<v Bart Decrem:>So now, like every entrepreneurial instinct you

2615
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.430
<v Bart Decrem:>have and their instincts as a musician

2616
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:12.660
<v Bart Decrem:>is, I'm going to do that again

2617
01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.559
<v Bart Decrem:>tomorrow.

2618
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:15.330
<v Bart Decrem:>So if 40 people showed up on

2619
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.730
<v Bart Decrem:>the first day, sometimes 80 show up

2620
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:19.470
<v Bart Decrem:>the next day, but more often 39

2621
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:20.700
<v Bart Decrem:>show up the next day, you know?

2622
01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:21.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And by the time it's the 10th

2623
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:23.400
<v Bart Decrem:>day, nobody shows up anymore because you're

2624
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.590
<v Bart Decrem:>oversupplying, you know, it's no longer scarce.

2625
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:26.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Experience.

2626
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.070
<v Bart Decrem:>And this, this is the single hardest

2627
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.780
<v Bart Decrem:>thing about, you know, live as a

2628
01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.559
<v Bart Decrem:>business.

2629
01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And then people solve it sometimes.

2630
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.020
<v Bart Decrem:>But it's a hard problem.

2631
01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:34.890
<v Bart Decrem:>And that was the a problem that

2632
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:36.870
<v Bart Decrem:>we ran into with that was called,

2633
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:39.900
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, what was that one called?

2634
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:40.830
<v Bart Decrem:>I was going to call it wave,

2635
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:41.850
<v Bart Decrem:>but that was a different app.

2636
01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.350
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, amplify.

2637
01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.490
<v Bart Decrem:>So that one was called.

2638
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:47.430
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2639
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.620
<v Karen Herman:>And amplify.

2640
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:50.549
<v Karen Herman:>Period.

2641
01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.300
<v Karen Herman:>Fi.

2642
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:51.870
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2643
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:53.460
<v Bart Decrem:>We've done a we've done a good

2644
01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.450
<v Bart Decrem:>job at naming.

2645
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.620
<v Bart Decrem:>My favorite one is the one I

2646
01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.910
<v Bart Decrem:>have right now, which is called Sub

2647
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:57.420
<v Bart Decrem:>Club.

2648
01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Sub dot club.

2649
01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:00.000
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a good name.

2650
01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:02.130
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2651
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:05.460
<v Karen Herman:>So, so did the hobby fold or

2652
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.300
<v Karen Herman:>did you just.

2653
01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:06.630
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

2654
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:07.530
<v Bart Decrem:>It failed.

2655
01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.370
<v Karen Herman:>Okay.

2656
01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.110
<v Karen Herman:>Um, is that then when you went

2657
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:12.540
<v Karen Herman:>to and created Mozilla Builders?

2658
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.250
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

2659
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.889
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, the hobby failed.

2660
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.389
<v Bart Decrem:>Trump was president Netscape and I'm sorry.

2661
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:23.220
<v Bart Decrem:>Sorry, Facebook and Twitter were sort of

2662
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.660
<v Bart Decrem:>all in the mix of the 2016

2663
01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:25.019
<v Bart Decrem:>election.

2664
01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:26.549
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, what have we done?

2665
01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:28.560
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, which is which is a

2666
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.610
<v Bart Decrem:>great question.

2667
01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.719
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, so when I'm laughing because, I

2668
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.679
<v Bart Decrem:>mean, it's not a great question.

2669
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I was really taken aback

2670
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.340
<v Bart Decrem:>by how technology was sort of in

2671
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.780
<v Bart Decrem:>the mix in that election.

2672
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:41.490
<v Bart Decrem:>And, you know, if this one comes

2673
01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.110
<v Bart Decrem:>out wrong and, you know, I think

2674
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:44.849
<v Bart Decrem:>we're looking at it all over again.

2675
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:48.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, uh, and so I wanted

2676
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.330
<v Bart Decrem:>to use technology for good.

2677
01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:53.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And, uh, I spent a few months

2678
01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.320
<v Bart Decrem:>at DuckDuckGo.

2679
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I talked to a lot of

2680
01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:00.300
<v Bart Decrem:>folks and reconnected with Mitchell Baker and,

2681
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.129
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, who was running Mozilla, and she

2682
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.650
<v Bart Decrem:>was like, hey, you know, I'm looking

2683
01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:05.759
<v Bart Decrem:>we're looking for we're open to new

2684
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.150
<v Bart Decrem:>ideas.

2685
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:07.500
<v Bart Decrem:>You're a creative person.

2686
01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Come back.

2687
01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:10.050
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, and so I spent a

2688
01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:11.700
<v Bart Decrem:>year and a half or so at

2689
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.179
<v Bart Decrem:>Mozilla.

2690
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.400
<v Bart Decrem:>My second tour of duty as I,

2691
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.590
<v Bart Decrem:>as I like to say, uh, working

2692
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:20.070
<v Bart Decrem:>with, um, uh, Mark Mayo, who had,

2693
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.920
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, run the Firefox organization and a

2694
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.790
<v Bart Decrem:>fantastic entrepreneur and, and mentor and human

2695
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:29.970
<v Bart Decrem:>being, and Bijan Marashi and Mitchell put

2696
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:30.780
<v Bart Decrem:>the three of us in a room

2697
01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Bart Decrem:>and go, y'all go figure out some

2698
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Bart Decrem:>cool stuff.

2699
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:35.900
<v Bart Decrem:>And out of that came Mozilla builders.

2700
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Bart Decrem:>And the idea was, um, I mean,

2701
01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Bart Decrem:>the simple question Mitchell asked was like,

2702
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Bart Decrem:>what's your next big idea?

2703
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.460
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, well, I don't

2704
01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Bart Decrem:>have any good ideas.

2705
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Bart Decrem:>And Firefox was never my idea.

2706
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.910
<v Bart Decrem:>But sometimes, like, like to find people

2707
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Bart Decrem:>with good ideas.

2708
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.559
<v Bart Decrem:>So why don't we go do that?

2709
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Bart Decrem:>So let's go look for folks with

2710
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Bart Decrem:>fresh ideas.

2711
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and we built a little incubator.

2712
01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:57.800
<v Bart Decrem:>We called it Mozilla Builders.

2713
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.670
<v Bart Decrem:>We shipped it during Covid.

2714
01:19:58.670 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Bart Decrem:>I think we shipped it in two

2715
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Bart Decrem:>and a half weeks.

2716
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, a woman named Kathy Pham got

2717
01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.080
<v Bart Decrem:>involved, and we built a whole little

2718
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.380
<v Bart Decrem:>team, uh, and we, we said we're

2719
01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.170
<v Bart Decrem:>looking for folks that, you know, want

2720
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.760
<v Bart Decrem:>to use technology to build a better

2721
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.270
<v Bart Decrem:>world.

2722
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:15.590
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was very open ended that

2723
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:16.220
<v Bart Decrem:>way.

2724
01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.770
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and one of the things that

2725
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.320
<v Bart Decrem:>happened that I was really struck by

2726
01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.469
<v Bart Decrem:>is I remember applying to Y Combinator,

2727
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:25.580
<v Bart Decrem:>I think, for the hobby or for

2728
01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.750
<v Bart Decrem:>one of my projects, you know, like

2729
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.309
<v Bart Decrem:>a year or two later and hanging

2730
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.940
<v Bart Decrem:>out at the Y Combinator offices.

2731
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.519
<v Bart Decrem:>It's a cool group of people, the

2732
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.710
<v Bart Decrem:>folks that apply, the young entrepreneurs that

2733
01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:38.349
<v Bart Decrem:>are there, they're nerds, dude.

2734
01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.730
<v Bart Decrem:>They just they're like cables hanging out

2735
01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:40.390
<v Bart Decrem:>of their pockets.

2736
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:41.770
<v Bart Decrem:>And they want to they want to

2737
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.720
<v Bart Decrem:>build cool shit, and they also want

2738
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:44.590
<v Bart Decrem:>to make money.

2739
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:46.330
<v Bart Decrem:>People are people, right?

2740
01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.910
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but they're good people that believe

2741
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:52.030
<v Bart Decrem:>in the power of technology, and they

2742
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.340
<v Bart Decrem:>think this technology can do cool shit

2743
01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.900
<v Bart Decrem:>in the exact same way that Steve

2744
01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.880
<v Bart Decrem:>Jobs thought about it, and Andy Hertzfeld

2745
01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.740
<v Bart Decrem:>and everybody else, you know, Linus Torvalds.

2746
01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:02.080
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, there's a lot

2747
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:03.790
<v Bart Decrem:>of there's some shitty people out there.

2748
01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:06.310
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a lot of awesome people that

2749
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:08.440
<v Bart Decrem:>believe their technology can help build a

2750
01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.660
<v Bart Decrem:>better world and solve problems we're solving,

2751
01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:12.970
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, um, and so let's go

2752
01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:14.770
<v Bart Decrem:>find them, you know, and really look

2753
01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:16.030
<v Bart Decrem:>for folks who can explain how this

2754
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.840
<v Bart Decrem:>is going to help build a better

2755
01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.230
<v Bart Decrem:>world.

2756
01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:18.910
<v Bart Decrem:>And, and that that impact is sort

2757
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:19.990
<v Bart Decrem:>of really at the center of what

2758
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.830
<v Bart Decrem:>they're trying to do.

2759
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:22.210
<v Bart Decrem:>And we found a lot of great

2760
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:22.690
<v Bart Decrem:>people.

2761
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:23.769
<v Bart Decrem:>And then a lot of them looked

2762
01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:25.180
<v Bart Decrem:>like they might as well have been

2763
01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:27.130
<v Bart Decrem:>at a Y Combinator fundraising, you know,

2764
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:28.570
<v Bart Decrem:>pitch as at Mozilla.

2765
01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:30.340
<v Bart Decrem:>And then some of them were activists

2766
01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.720
<v Bart Decrem:>that came from the nonprofit and community

2767
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.290
<v Bart Decrem:>organizing background.

2768
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's great too.

2769
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.870
<v Bart Decrem:>But that's what we built at Mozilla

2770
01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:35.559
<v Bart Decrem:>Builders.

2771
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.820
<v Bart Decrem:>It was great work, and they just

2772
01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.910
<v Bart Decrem:>relaunched it around AI themes a few

2773
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:41.080
<v Bart Decrem:>months ago, so that's great.

2774
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.700
<v Karen Herman:>What were some of the promising projects

2775
01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.780
<v Karen Herman:>that came out of that?

2776
01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.969
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, one of my favorite was was,

2777
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.980
<v Bart Decrem:>was, was was was was not a

2778
01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.090
<v Bart Decrem:>technology one.

2779
01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:52.420
<v Bart Decrem:>It was a group of Yale students

2780
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:56.680
<v Bart Decrem:>that were, um, that were making free

2781
01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.840
<v Bart Decrem:>phone calls available to people that were

2782
01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.590
<v Bart Decrem:>locked up.

2783
01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:02.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And so their insight was, there's a

2784
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:07.720
<v Bart Decrem:>whole predatory industry around phone calls into

2785
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:11.349
<v Bart Decrem:>jails and prisons where they are fundraising.

2786
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.780
<v Bart Decrem:>They're funding vehicles for the, for for,

2787
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.429
<v Bart Decrem:>for the for for the industrial company,

2788
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.530
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, the prison industrial complex.

2789
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:19.420
<v Bart Decrem:>And then there's businesses on top of

2790
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:22.210
<v Bart Decrem:>that that make just sort of, um,

2791
01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:23.950
<v Bart Decrem:>that, that, that, that are, that are,

2792
01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.440
<v Bart Decrem:>that are leeching on, on vulnerable and

2793
01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.849
<v Bart Decrem:>low income populations.

2794
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.320
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, folks who have relatives that

2795
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.240
<v Bart Decrem:>are locked up in jails and prisons.

2796
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.760
<v Bart Decrem:>And so they were they were Emilio

2797
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.900
<v Bart Decrem:>was called, it is called.

2798
01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:38.020
<v Bart Decrem:>And Emilio was a team of students

2799
01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.670
<v Bart Decrem:>that were just making free phone calls

2800
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:40.240
<v Bart Decrem:>available.

2801
01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.679
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was fantastic.

2802
01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.180
<v Bart Decrem:>And, and, and they've done a lot

2803
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:43.960
<v Bart Decrem:>of good work.

2804
01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.700
<v Bart Decrem:>So that's one extreme.

2805
01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.099
<v Bart Decrem:>There were some really cool crypto projects.

2806
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.639
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, there was a crowdsourcing project by

2807
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.559
<v Bart Decrem:>a group of Waterloo students out of

2808
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:54.430
<v Bart Decrem:>Canada.

2809
01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.490
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, that was I think it was

2810
01:22:57.490 --> 01:23:01.150
<v Bart Decrem:>folks in Vancouver that were attached to

2811
01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:04.179
<v Bart Decrem:>the Chinese, uh, immigrant communities there.

2812
01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Bart Decrem:>And then there was like, crowd shopping

2813
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Bart Decrem:>traditions out of China, out of mainland

2814
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Bart Decrem:>China.

2815
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Bart Decrem:>I think it was where aunties would

2816
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:16.179
<v Bart Decrem:>go to the markets on the morning,

2817
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.769
<v Bart Decrem:>and then they would sell, you know,

2818
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Bart Decrem:>to their neighbors, you know, so it's

2819
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Bart Decrem:>kind of like it's kind of like

2820
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Bart Decrem:>crowd source distribution, you know.

2821
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we had college students from

2822
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Bart Decrem:>from Waterloo that were going to the

2823
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Bart Decrem:>farmers market at 4 a.m.

2824
01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Bart Decrem:>and then using WhatsApp to make organic

2825
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Bart Decrem:>and farmer farmer market foods available to

2826
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Bart Decrem:>their local community.

2827
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:37.030
<v Bart Decrem:>So there was a bunch of different

2828
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Bart Decrem:>approaches to solve, to using technology to

2829
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.309
<v Bart Decrem:>solve real world problems, and then and

2830
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Bart Decrem:>then sometimes stay in the digital realm.

2831
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Bart Decrem:>But there was a bunch of stuff

2832
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Bart Decrem:>in decentralized, slack, alternative, all kinds of

2833
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff.

2834
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2835
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Karen Herman:>One of the things that when it

2836
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:52.089
<v Karen Herman:>was started, you, you said, you know,

2837
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.890
<v Karen Herman:>it was going to define also fixing

2838
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Karen Herman:>the internet.

2839
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:55.420
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2840
01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:55.840
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

2841
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Bart Decrem:>Which was great because it was like,

2842
01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Bart Decrem:>let's, let's fix the internet.

2843
01:23:58.210 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Bart Decrem:>And then you're, you're sort of the

2844
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Bart Decrem:>image is like the Comcast guy showing

2845
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.889
<v Bart Decrem:>up at your house.

2846
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Bart Decrem:>I have a t shirt that says,

2847
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Bart Decrem:>let's fix the internet.

2848
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, yeah, I yeah.

2849
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes, yes, yes.

2850
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:10.990
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but it's like this is

2851
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:12.280
<v Bart Decrem:>one of the this is sort of

2852
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Bart Decrem:>that same thing that open source tends

2853
01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.750
<v Bart Decrem:>to be bad at because we lead

2854
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Bart Decrem:>with values and strongly held beliefs.

2855
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.850
<v Bart Decrem:>We can be a little literal.

2856
01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.630
<v Bart Decrem:>And so when you get into the

2857
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.340
<v Bart Decrem:>world of consumer marketing, or if you

2858
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:27.590
<v Bart Decrem:>listen to Kamala Harris on TV, right.

2859
01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, you've got to figure out a

2860
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:31.429
<v Bart Decrem:>way to say your stuff simply.

2861
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And sometimes that means that you're 90.

2862
01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.170
<v Bart Decrem:>That it's 99% literally correct, and that

2863
01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:37.400
<v Bart Decrem:>it's that there's like there's like a

2864
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.600
<v Bart Decrem:>literal part of it that you might

2865
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.350
<v Bart Decrem:>be getting wrong.

2866
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:42.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And so there's a poetry of marketing

2867
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:44.270
<v Bart Decrem:>and talking to consumers, you know, let's

2868
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:45.620
<v Bart Decrem:>fix the internet is a good one.

2869
01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:48.710
<v Karen Herman:>Um, then you went on to, to

2870
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.180
<v Karen Herman:>co-found Block Block?

2871
01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

2872
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:53.809
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I was I had a friend,

2873
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:55.010
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, so just as I was getting

2874
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:57.140
<v Bart Decrem:>restless for the second time at Mozilla,

2875
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.670
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, and Mitchell was like, are you

2876
01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.960
<v Bart Decrem:>sure this is the right place for

2877
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.440
<v Bart Decrem:>you, Bart?

2878
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:01.610
<v Bart Decrem:>And good question, Mitchell.

2879
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.870
<v Bart Decrem:>Let's talk about it.

2880
01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.599
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, just as I was getting restless.

2881
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.540
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, I had a friend on

2882
01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.269
<v Bart Decrem:>Twitter, uh, who was an artist.

2883
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Like a like a like a punk

2884
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:13.219
<v Bart Decrem:>artist.

2885
01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.839
<v Bart Decrem:>And he was talking about this thing

2886
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.929
<v Bart Decrem:>called NFTs and artists led collectives.

2887
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:18.769
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, this is a

2888
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:19.820
<v Bart Decrem:>whole new world.

2889
01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.049
<v Bart Decrem:>This is really interesting.

2890
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:23.660
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Mark and I left and

2891
01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.580
<v Bart Decrem:>we're like we're interested in decentralization.

2892
01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.230
<v Bart Decrem:>There's this thing called the blockchain.

2893
01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:29.420
<v Bart Decrem:>And then Mozilla invested in it.

2894
01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.530
<v Bart Decrem:>And some of the other folks that

2895
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:32.360
<v Bart Decrem:>invested in the hobby and stuff invested.

2896
01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.170
<v Bart Decrem:>And we raised a couple of million

2897
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.180
<v Bart Decrem:>dollars, and we called the company block

2898
01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:35.660
<v Bart Decrem:>block.

2899
01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:38.179
<v Bart Decrem:>And we were interested in decentralization and

2900
01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.470
<v Bart Decrem:>the blockchain.

2901
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:41.360
<v Bart Decrem:>And then as we it was like

2902
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:43.879
<v Bart Decrem:>literally the month that NFT craze happened,

2903
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:44.420
<v Bart Decrem:>you know?

2904
01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:46.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I helped organize a thing

2905
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:50.360
<v Bart Decrem:>called the Meebits Dao, which was around

2906
01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.980
<v Bart Decrem:>portable digital assets.

2907
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.269
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, oh, this is like

2908
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:55.490
<v Bart Decrem:>the foundation of like, like your your

2909
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:57.200
<v Bart Decrem:>digital stuff should belong to you, and

2910
01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.730
<v Bart Decrem:>you should be able to log in

2911
01:25:58.730 --> 01:26:00.830
<v Bart Decrem:>with your digital avatar wherever you want.

2912
01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.730
<v Bart Decrem:>I mean, a lot of these are

2913
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.350
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of the kinds of concepts that,

2914
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, OAuth and the web standards

2915
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Bart Decrem:>and Web2 we've been excited about, you

2916
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Bart Decrem:>know, so I was like, that's sort

2917
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Bart Decrem:>of how I entered the space.

2918
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Bart Decrem:>And we built an artist collective called

2919
01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Bart Decrem:>matter that I still love.

2920
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:16.219
<v Bart Decrem:>That guy is still working on.

2921
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:18.889
<v Bart Decrem:>We built a digital contracts platform on

2922
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:20.089
<v Bart Decrem:>the blockchain.

2923
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:23.900
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I kept being confused about

2924
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Bart Decrem:>what is crypto.

2925
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Bart Decrem:>Because it's just the technology was always

2926
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Bart Decrem:>just really complicated.

2927
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:33.950
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and then ultimately I concluded that

2928
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Bart Decrem:>there's great technology and great people.

2929
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:39.800
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm actually a fan of Vitalik Buterin,

2930
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Bart Decrem:>the Ethereum founder, and several other folks,

2931
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Bart Decrem:>but but by and large, it's part

2932
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Bart Decrem:>of the gambling economy.

2933
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Bart Decrem:>And when I'm watching the NBA, I

2934
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Bart Decrem:>love watching basketball, but it's basically a

2935
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.269
<v Bart Decrem:>way to run ads for betting platforms.

2936
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Bart Decrem:>And so between free to play gaming

2937
01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:03.349
<v Bart Decrem:>and sports betting, starting all of us

2938
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Bart Decrem:>into gambling addicts and meme stocks and

2939
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:09.590
<v Bart Decrem:>all that stuff, um, basically, it's another

2940
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:11.509
<v Bart Decrem:>set of betting vehicles.

2941
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Bart Decrem:>So too often the world of crypto

2942
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Bart Decrem:>and NFTs and so on is basically

2943
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.799
<v Bart Decrem:>an excuse to bet and gamble.

2944
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Bart Decrem:>And these are very illiquid markets that

2945
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.830
<v Bart Decrem:>are easily open to manipulation.

2946
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Bart Decrem:>So there's a lot of abuse and

2947
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:23.510
<v Bart Decrem:>we've seen all of it.

2948
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Bart Decrem:>So I fell out of love with

2949
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.280
<v Bart Decrem:>it.

2950
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Bart Decrem:>And we pivoted the company towards what's

2951
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Bart Decrem:>now the Boulevard where we built Mastodon

2952
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:32.690
<v Bart Decrem:>app called mammoth.

2953
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Bart Decrem:>And most recently I've been working on

2954
01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Bart Decrem:>an app called Supperclub.

2955
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Bart Decrem:>So we've used that the funding from

2956
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Bart Decrem:>Blog block and pivoted into the Mastodon

2957
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.410
<v Bart Decrem:>work I've been doing.

2958
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.370
<v Karen Herman:>So talk about Mastodon.

2959
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:44.090
<v Karen Herman:>What is it?

2960
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, Mastodon is a decentralized social network

2961
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Bart Decrem:>that looks and feels like an open

2962
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Bart Decrem:>source alternative to Twitter.

2963
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and still still is.

2964
01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.240
<v Bart Decrem:>And it has, depending on how you

2965
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.389
<v Bart Decrem:>grade, you could say it has a

2966
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.800
<v Bart Decrem:>million users.

2967
01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.790
<v Bart Decrem:>You could say it has 10 million

2968
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Bart Decrem:>users.

2969
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and it is open source and

2970
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Bart Decrem:>it is decentralized.

2971
01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.480
<v Bart Decrem:>So anybody can set up a mastodon

2972
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.480
<v Bart Decrem:>server and communities self-govern and set up

2973
01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.349
<v Bart Decrem:>their own, um, content rules and terms

2974
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.160
<v Bart Decrem:>and community.

2975
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.420
<v Bart Decrem:>Community moderates the content and you can

2976
01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:17.129
<v Bart Decrem:>block people and decelerate.

2977
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:19.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And Truth Social was built on top

2978
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.320
<v Bart Decrem:>of Mastodon technology, and it was rejected

2979
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.550
<v Bart Decrem:>by the rest of the community and

2980
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:24.870
<v Bart Decrem:>the open source tradition and so on

2981
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:25.560
<v Bart Decrem:>and so on.

2982
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:27.600
<v Bart Decrem:>It is an open source alternative to

2983
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:30.059
<v Bart Decrem:>Twitter that has had a couple of

2984
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.820
<v Bart Decrem:>moments in the sun, the most recent

2985
01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:33.750
<v Bart Decrem:>and biggest one.

2986
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.420
<v Bart Decrem:>After all the turmoil at Twitter with

2987
01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Elon, Mastodon had a real moment in

2988
01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.480
<v Bart Decrem:>the sun.

2989
01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:44.340
<v Karen Herman:>And what about just the user experience?

2990
01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:47.220
<v Karen Herman:>How did that differ from from, say,

2991
01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.090
<v Karen Herman:>a Twitter?

2992
01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:48.690
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, it's.

2993
01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:49.800
<v Bart Decrem:>The same, but worse.

2994
01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.020
<v Bart Decrem:>It's like a shitty version of Twitter

2995
01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.880
<v Bart Decrem:>is the honest answer.

2996
01:28:54.090 --> 01:28:55.560
<v Bart Decrem:>And now I'm going to get like,

2997
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:56.850
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, like a bunch of angry

2998
01:28:56.850 --> 01:28:57.360
<v Bart Decrem:>comments.

2999
01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.759
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but but that's the truth.

3000
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:02.519
<v Bart Decrem:>It the problem with open source and

3001
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.030
<v Bart Decrem:>decentralization, it is very hard to build

3002
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Bart Decrem:>a great user experience all the way

3003
01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.060
<v Bart Decrem:>to the end.

3004
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Bart Decrem:>And so with open source and decentralization,

3005
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Bart Decrem:>you get infinite customizability, and the cost

3006
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Bart Decrem:>of it is confusing user experiences all

3007
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Bart Decrem:>over the place.

3008
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so as a practical matter,

3009
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.549
<v Bart Decrem:>a social network is a place.

3010
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Bart Decrem:>It's a bar, it's a bunch of

3011
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:29.790
<v Bart Decrem:>people hanging out.

3012
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Bart Decrem:>And then the question is, who are

3013
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:32.910
<v Bart Decrem:>you hanging out with and what's the

3014
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Bart Decrem:>vibe?

3015
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Bart Decrem:>And if you're hanging out with people

3016
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Bart Decrem:>you like and the vibe is good,

3017
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Bart Decrem:>that's a good social network.

3018
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.840
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a successful social network.

3019
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I think if you think

3020
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.980
<v Bart Decrem:>of a social network as a set

3021
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:50.370
<v Bart Decrem:>of technologies and features, well, we're living

3022
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.580
<v Bart Decrem:>in a world, it's technology's world, and

3023
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.570
<v Bart Decrem:>we just live in it, you know?

3024
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:56.040
<v Bart Decrem:>So so it is true that the

3025
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Bart Decrem:>architectural choices that we make at the

3026
01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:01.140
<v Bart Decrem:>lower levels of our stack really impact

3027
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.670
<v Bart Decrem:>what the world looks like, that we

3028
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:03.510
<v Bart Decrem:>build on top of it.

3029
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:04.950
<v Bart Decrem:>But at the end of the day,

3030
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.660
<v Bart Decrem:>a social network is a place.

3031
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:10.470
<v Bart Decrem:>And the problem with Mastodon is that

3032
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:13.590
<v Bart Decrem:>it's confusing and complicated, and you ask

3033
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.540
<v Bart Decrem:>people to choose a server, and people

3034
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.800
<v Bart Decrem:>don't know what a server is, and

3035
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Bart Decrem:>they just want to go away.

3036
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.680
<v Bart Decrem:>And I feel like I learned that

3037
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.560
<v Bart Decrem:>lesson when we shipped Thunderbird back in

3038
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:25.620
<v Bart Decrem:>2005, you know, and Scott, who was

3039
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Bart Decrem:>running Thunderbird, he knew that.

3040
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.790
<v Bart Decrem:>I remember doing trying to do marketing

3041
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:32.220
<v Bart Decrem:>for Thunderbird and telling them this is

3042
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Bart Decrem:>a better email app.

3043
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.010
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I would ask them, what's

3044
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:36.000
<v Bart Decrem:>your current email app?

3045
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.170
<v Bart Decrem:>And they would say, my email app

3046
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Bart Decrem:>is Gmail, right?

3047
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.820
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, people don't know the difference between

3048
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.950
<v Bart Decrem:>Google and Chrome like to this day.

3049
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:47.100
<v Bart Decrem:>Like I promise you, more than half

3050
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.840
<v Bart Decrem:>of the US population does not know

3051
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.519
<v Bart Decrem:>the difference between Chrome and Google.

3052
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.809
<v Bart Decrem:>That is the same thing to them,

3053
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.290
<v Bart Decrem:>you know?

3054
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Bart Decrem:>And in 2005, people did not know

3055
01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Bart Decrem:>the difference between an email client and

3056
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Bart Decrem:>an email service like Gmail.

3057
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.760
<v Bart Decrem:>That's that's what I use, you know.

3058
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.680
<v Bart Decrem:>And so we knew when we shipped

3059
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Thunderbird, it was like, I gotta explain

3060
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.040
<v Bart Decrem:>to people that it's an app and

3061
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.210
<v Bart Decrem:>you can use it to connect.

3062
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:09.929
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh my God.

3063
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, and so when you're talking

3064
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:15.720
<v Bart Decrem:>about that, you're already talking about the

3065
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.170
<v Bart Decrem:>sides.

3066
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:18.210
<v Bart Decrem:>The point for most people.

3067
01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.540
<v Bart Decrem:>And so a social network is a

3068
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Bart Decrem:>vibe.

3069
01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:23.670
<v Bart Decrem:>And we focus too much on the

3070
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.160
<v Bart Decrem:>buttons and the features and not enough

3071
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Bart Decrem:>on what is the place we're creating

3072
01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.520
<v Bart Decrem:>here.

3073
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, or we do.

3074
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:33.480
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's a really tiny place for

3075
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:35.430
<v Bart Decrem:>a really specific group of people.

3076
01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.080
<v Bart Decrem:>If we're trying to build a safe

3077
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Bart Decrem:>room for a marginalized community, that's amazing

3078
01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:41.160
<v Bart Decrem:>and that's important.

3079
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.139
<v Bart Decrem:>And Mastodon does an exceptional job at

3080
01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:43.920
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

3081
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:47.640
<v Bart Decrem:>I am most interested in the fact

3082
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.320
<v Bart Decrem:>that, I don't know, 300 million people

3083
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Bart Decrem:>are getting massive amounts of disinformation in

3084
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Bart Decrem:>this election cycle, and it might just

3085
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.310
<v Bart Decrem:>swing the election right.

3086
01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.420
<v Bart Decrem:>But young males under the age of

3087
01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Bart Decrem:>30 voting, you know, in too large

3088
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.230
<v Bart Decrem:>a proportion by 3% for Donald Trump,

3089
01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:58.590
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

3090
01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:01.080
<v Bart Decrem:>That's what drives me nuts, right?

3091
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:02.430
<v Bart Decrem:>So I really wish we had 300

3092
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:04.350
<v Bart Decrem:>million people on something other than Twitter.

3093
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:05.639
<v Bart Decrem:>And we do it's called threads and

3094
01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.390
<v Bart Decrem:>so on and so on.

3095
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:08.730
<v Bart Decrem:>But that's what I'm most excited about.

3096
01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:11.010
<v Bart Decrem:>And Mastodon is not given an answer

3097
01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:11.339
<v Bart Decrem:>to that.

3098
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:12.599
<v Bart Decrem:>And they would say that's a feature,

3099
01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:13.320
<v Bart Decrem:>not a bug.

3100
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:14.730
<v Bart Decrem:>For me, that's a bug.

3101
01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.590
<v Bart Decrem:>I wish we lived in a world

3102
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:18.120
<v Bart Decrem:>where 300 million people were on Mastodon

3103
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:18.630
<v Bart Decrem:>today.

3104
01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:19.770
<v Bart Decrem:>I think that would be a better

3105
01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:20.490
<v Bart Decrem:>world.

3106
01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.160
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and the complexity of Mastodon

3107
01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.330
<v Bart Decrem:>has gotten in the way of that.

3108
01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:25.890
<v Karen Herman:>Interesting.

3109
01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.280
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

3110
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:27.630
<v Karen Herman:>But it also, it also just in

3111
01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:29.519
<v Karen Herman:>terms of your own cycle, you're almost

3112
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.349
<v Karen Herman:>back to pirate radio and you're in

3113
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.920
<v Karen Herman:>your own way.

3114
01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:32.280
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

3115
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.740
<v Bart Decrem:>I remember, I remember.

3116
01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:36.210
<v Bart Decrem:>And so and by the way, this

3117
01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:38.970
<v Bart Decrem:>is a personal priority thing, right?

3118
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.769
<v Bart Decrem:>Like the fact that there is a

3119
01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:42.839
<v Bart Decrem:>safe place for marginalized community.

3120
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:43.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3121
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.469
<v Bart Decrem:>Like.

3122
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:45.090
<v Bart Decrem:>And there's many of them on Mastodon,

3123
01:32:45.090 --> 01:32:47.639
<v Bart Decrem:>and they're safe and and I cannot

3124
01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Bart Decrem:>be abused here.

3125
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:50.940
<v Bart Decrem:>That's amazing and important.

3126
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:51.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3127
01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.560
<v Bart Decrem:>And I have the privilege to not

3128
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.400
<v Bart Decrem:>have to worry about that as a

3129
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.180
<v Bart Decrem:>white male and all that kind of

3130
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:54.330
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff.

3131
01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.860
<v Bart Decrem:>And that's true, right?

3132
01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:57.960
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I don't mean to minimize

3133
01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.230
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

3134
01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:00.900
<v Bart Decrem:>I just mean to say, I know

3135
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.040
<v Bart Decrem:>me.

3136
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.990
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to see an alternative to

3137
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Bart Decrem:>X with 300 million people getting massive

3138
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:08.200
<v Bart Decrem:>amounts of firehose misinformation, right?

3139
01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And just no way of avoiding that.

3140
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Bart Decrem:>Elon Musk, waves of misinformation.

3141
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:11.860
<v Bart Decrem:>That's right.

3142
01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a personal thing.

3143
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.309
<v Bart Decrem:>Doesn't mean that Mastodon isn't doing right

3144
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:16.840
<v Bart Decrem:>by its community and doing really important

3145
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.250
<v Bart Decrem:>work for communities that really need it

3146
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Bart Decrem:>and deserve it, and have their agency,

3147
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.490
<v Bart Decrem:>and they should set their own rules.

3148
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.720
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, that's great.

3149
01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:24.160
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, this is a personal thing.

3150
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.420
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, what?

3151
01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.730
<v Bart Decrem:>I, you know, the way that where

3152
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.799
<v Bart Decrem:>I prefer to focus my energy.

3153
01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:31.809
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but yes, it does bring me

3154
01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Bart Decrem:>back all the way to pirate radio.

3155
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.099
<v Bart Decrem:>I remember in the early, early days

3156
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.760
<v Bart Decrem:>of me being back on Mastodon posting

3157
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.160
<v Bart Decrem:>at like 10 p.m., my sister from

3158
01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.690
<v Bart Decrem:>Belgium had sent me.

3159
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:45.550
<v Bart Decrem:>There was a like a 40 year

3160
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:48.430
<v Bart Decrem:>reunion of the the FM Brussels.

3161
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:49.240
<v Bart Decrem:>That was the name of the radio

3162
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Bart Decrem:>station, the crew, you know, like the

3163
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Bart Decrem:>talent, on air talent that they they

3164
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Bart Decrem:>all came together, you know, 40 years

3165
01:33:53.710 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Bart Decrem:>later and she sent me the Billboard

3166
01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.600
<v Bart Decrem:>chart that I typed up when I

3167
01:33:58.600 --> 01:33:59.470
<v Bart Decrem:>was 13 years old.

3168
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Bart Decrem:>I was at Catholic school and we

3169
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.070
<v Bart Decrem:>Typekit a carbon copy thing at a

3170
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Jesuit school and they would use the

3171
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.850
<v Bart Decrem:>Jesuit guy would run his stencil machine.

3172
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And number one on the chart was

3173
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.640
<v Bart Decrem:>Jesus and the Mary Chain.

3174
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, and I think the Sex

3175
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Pistols were still still around and stuff,

3176
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.230
<v Bart Decrem:>and that was the kind of shit

3177
01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:15.070
<v Bart Decrem:>that was on there, you know.

3178
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.420
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and I was like, oh my

3179
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.080
<v Bart Decrem:>God, it's amazing.

3180
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Bart Decrem:>There's all these signposts because I didn't

3181
01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.840
<v Bart Decrem:>speak very good English, you know, and

3182
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.800
<v Bart Decrem:>I had to literally listen to the

3183
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Bart Decrem:>radio and there was no internet to

3184
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.469
<v Bart Decrem:>spell check, you know?

3185
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:26.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and, and I posted that thing

3186
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.429
<v Bart Decrem:>on Mastodon.

3187
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:28.210
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, look at this.

3188
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.219
<v Bart Decrem:>This is like a top 50 chart

3189
01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.540
<v Bart Decrem:>from from 1983.

3190
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.089
<v Bart Decrem:>And like, three minutes later, some person

3191
01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Bart Decrem:>in New Zealand had built a playlist

3192
01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:38.950
<v Bart Decrem:>on YouTube of all those songs.

3193
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.540
<v Bart Decrem:>Like within three minutes I was like,

3194
01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:42.429
<v Bart Decrem:>oh my God, it's just like it's

3195
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Bart Decrem:>full circle.

3196
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Same thing.

3197
01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Bart Decrem:>It was the same people and the

3198
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.550
<v Bart Decrem:>same ethos and vibe, and it's what

3199
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:49.330
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm here for.

3200
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.800
<v Karen Herman:>Oh, that is awesome.

3201
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.059
<v Karen Herman:>You had mentioned Sub Club.

3202
01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:52.630
<v Karen Herman:>Do you want to talk a little

3203
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Karen Herman:>bit about that?

3204
01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

3205
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:59.170
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so, um, shipped mammoths, a mastodon,

3206
01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.570
<v Bart Decrem:>more user friendly Mastodon clients.

3207
01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:03.670
<v Bart Decrem:>and it's a good product and we

3208
01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.020
<v Bart Decrem:>got really good response to it, but

3209
01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.880
<v Bart Decrem:>it's just not viable at all.

3210
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:09.400
<v Bart Decrem:>Like nobody nobody wants that ain't self-sufficient

3211
01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.240
<v Bart Decrem:>and nobody's funding that.

3212
01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.560
<v Bart Decrem:>And Membership's not going to pay for

3213
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.070
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

3214
01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:14.050
<v Bart Decrem:>So I needed to pivot to keep

3215
01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:15.099
<v Bart Decrem:>the lights on.

3216
01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:16.390
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, I think it was the same.

3217
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:17.560
<v Bart Decrem:>Josh is like, sometimes you got to

3218
01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.700
<v Bart Decrem:>go into cockroach mode, dude.

3219
01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:19.960
<v Bart Decrem:>You got to go survive.

3220
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.280
<v Bart Decrem:>So I was like, well, how can

3221
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:22.930
<v Bart Decrem:>I keep I want to keep working

3222
01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:24.490
<v Bart Decrem:>here because I like the cause.

3223
01:35:24.490 --> 01:35:25.600
<v Bart Decrem:>I like the people that are here

3224
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.160
<v Bart Decrem:>and what we're trying to do here.

3225
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:28.630
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, but I gotta keep the lights

3226
01:35:28.630 --> 01:35:29.140
<v Bart Decrem:>on.

3227
01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:33.940
<v Bart Decrem:>So I remember running into, um, uh,

3228
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:37.809
<v Bart Decrem:>Mike McCue and Eugene Roscoe from Flipboard

3229
01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:40.540
<v Bart Decrem:>and Mastodon, respectively, and asking them, hey,

3230
01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:41.889
<v Bart Decrem:>what needs building next?

3231
01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:43.780
<v Bart Decrem:>And at the same time, I was

3232
01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.100
<v Bart Decrem:>listening to Search Engine, which is my

3233
01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.320
<v Bart Decrem:>favorite podcast, and Casey Newton and Ezra

3234
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Klein and all those folks, you know,

3235
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:51.730
<v Bart Decrem:>um, and and we were looking they

3236
01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:55.000
<v Bart Decrem:>were looking at ChatGPT and generative AI

3237
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.769
<v Bart Decrem:>and what it's doing to the internet

3238
01:35:56.770 --> 01:36:00.490
<v Bart Decrem:>and how it is accelerating the decline

3239
01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of the open web.

3240
01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:02.680
<v Bart Decrem:>And I was like, oh, here we

3241
01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.130
<v Bart Decrem:>go again.

3242
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.420
<v Bart Decrem:>I know this story.

3243
01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:06.490
<v Bart Decrem:>This is the story of Firefox and

3244
01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:08.799
<v Bart Decrem:>open source, you know, and social networking

3245
01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.059
<v Bart Decrem:>and all this stuff coming together.

3246
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:10.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3247
01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:12.940
<v Bart Decrem:>And you can see the accelerating decline

3248
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Bart Decrem:>and, you know, publishing just really being

3249
01:36:15.670 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Bart Decrem:>struggling and laying off reporters and newsrooms

3250
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.690
<v Bart Decrem:>and all of this stuff happening.

3251
01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:20.710
<v Bart Decrem:>And now there's all this.

3252
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:21.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And on the other side of it,

3253
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:23.650
<v Bart Decrem:>there's all the synthetic media and things

3254
01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:24.970
<v Bart Decrem:>that summarize things you don't need to

3255
01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:25.270
<v Bart Decrem:>go look up.

3256
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Da da da da da da.

3257
01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.370
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm like, oh, wow.

3258
01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.740
<v Bart Decrem:>The open web, you know, is, you

3259
01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.230
<v Bart Decrem:>know, it is in severe decline.

3260
01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:34.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And there's like an existential crisis here

3261
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:37.600
<v Bart Decrem:>about the open web, the internet that

3262
01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.070
<v Bart Decrem:>I came here for, you know, whatever

3263
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:41.200
<v Bart Decrem:>it was, Eazel or Firefox, the promise

3264
01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.570
<v Bart Decrem:>of anybody, anywhere in the world can,

3265
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.790
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, express their ideas and you

3266
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:46.599
<v Bart Decrem:>can rise to the level of your

3267
01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.920
<v Bart Decrem:>talents and all this kind of stuff.

3268
01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.120
<v Bart Decrem:>You can find your tribe, all of

3269
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:49.510
<v Bart Decrem:>these things.

3270
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.900
<v Bart Decrem:>Right?

3271
01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:52.630
<v Bart Decrem:>It's all under it's all at risk

3272
01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:55.930
<v Bart Decrem:>because of how a very small group

3273
01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:57.040
<v Bart Decrem:>of people are just kind of, you

3274
01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.420
<v Bart Decrem:>know, strip mining the internet.

3275
01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.710
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and if you look underneath Mastodon,

3276
01:37:02.710 --> 01:37:04.450
<v Bart Decrem:>there is a set of protocols called

3277
01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:05.380
<v Bart Decrem:>activitypub.

3278
01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.559
<v Bart Decrem:>And activitypub is like social building blocks.

3279
01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.799
<v Bart Decrem:>And so I remember listening to Eugene

3280
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.190
<v Bart Decrem:>and Mike, but also Ezra, uh, you

3281
01:37:15.190 --> 01:37:16.360
<v Bart Decrem:>know, Casey Newton.

3282
01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.910
<v Bart Decrem:>And it was like, well, the social

3283
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:22.420
<v Bart Decrem:>web is, you know, at risk and

3284
01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.350
<v Bart Decrem:>in decline.

3285
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:25.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And Google has sort of like given

3286
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:26.019
<v Bart Decrem:>them sort of like one of the

3287
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:27.340
<v Bart Decrem:>core building blocks of the web that

3288
01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.420
<v Bart Decrem:>we've been living in, as Google as

3289
01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.650
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of the organizer and the indexer,

3290
01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.180
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, and they're no longer doing

3291
01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:31.360
<v Bart Decrem:>that.

3292
01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.040
<v Bart Decrem:>That's no longer their first priority, right?

3293
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:34.990
<v Bart Decrem:>It's strip mining it and getting it

3294
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:36.340
<v Bart Decrem:>to Gemini is, you know, you don't

3295
01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:36.639
<v Bart Decrem:>have to go.

3296
01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.050
<v Bart Decrem:>That's that's your priority, right?

3297
01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.210
<v Bart Decrem:>So, um, so looking at this landscape

3298
01:37:43.210 --> 01:37:45.760
<v Bart Decrem:>and this future, that the downside of

3299
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.590
<v Bart Decrem:>this future that we are seeing, um,

3300
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:51.190
<v Bart Decrem:>Activitypub feels like maybe our last and

3301
01:37:51.190 --> 01:37:53.440
<v Bart Decrem:>best chance to save the open web.

3302
01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:56.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so Mastodon is built on this

3303
01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:56.349
<v Bart Decrem:>thing.

3304
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:57.740
<v Bart Decrem:>It's an app and it's got its

3305
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:59.120
<v Bart Decrem:>strengths and weaknesses.

3306
01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.410
<v Bart Decrem:>And we just talked about that.

3307
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:01.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Underneath it there's a set of protocols

3308
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:03.080
<v Bart Decrem:>called activitypub.

3309
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.350
<v Bart Decrem:>And threads to some extent is betting

3310
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:07.340
<v Bart Decrem:>and built on that.

3311
01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:10.130
<v Bart Decrem:>And there's some limited amount of interoperability

3312
01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:12.200
<v Bart Decrem:>between threads and activitypub.

3313
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.870
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, Flipboard is on Activitypub.

3314
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:17.390
<v Bart Decrem:>You can federate your WordPress blog.

3315
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.730
<v Bart Decrem:>So there's a number of people that

3316
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:22.129
<v Bart Decrem:>are starting to interoperate and build on

3317
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:24.200
<v Bart Decrem:>top of Activitypub.

3318
01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.660
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the question I asked is

3319
01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.030
<v Bart Decrem:>like, hey, if we believe in a

3320
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:31.340
<v Bart Decrem:>future where there is a smaller open

3321
01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.630
<v Bart Decrem:>web, it's kind of like the indie

3322
01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:35.059
<v Bart Decrem:>web, and there is a small number,

3323
01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.849
<v Bart Decrem:>a smaller number of independent publishers, like

3324
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:39.830
<v Bart Decrem:>for, for media, maybe it's Casey Newton,

3325
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:41.540
<v Bart Decrem:>maybe it's information, maybe it's The Verge.

3326
01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:45.080
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, this is the right technology stack,

3327
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:47.180
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, a set of open protocols

3328
01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:49.849
<v Bart Decrem:>that allow us to have direct connections

3329
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:52.160
<v Bart Decrem:>to our audiences to get that stuff,

3330
01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.930
<v Bart Decrem:>to have social discovery like you used

3331
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:55.160
<v Bart Decrem:>to get it on Twitter.

3332
01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.770
<v Bart Decrem:>But for me as a publisher, to

3333
01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.260
<v Bart Decrem:>have to own, you know, my data

3334
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:01.760
<v Bart Decrem:>and to have a direct connection with

3335
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.320
<v Bart Decrem:>the folks that are reading my content

3336
01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.840
<v Bart Decrem:>and that like my content, that's the

3337
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.650
<v Bart Decrem:>promise of Activitypub.

3338
01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.870
<v Bart Decrem:>So the question is, how can I

3339
01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.660
<v Bart Decrem:>help bring about that future where there

3340
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.400
<v Bart Decrem:>is a thriving open web on protocols

3341
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.870
<v Bart Decrem:>of an open web, kind of like

3342
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:19.820
<v Bart Decrem:>the next gen of SMTP and email

3343
01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.900
<v Bart Decrem:>protocols, you know.

3344
01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.200
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the idea was, hey, creator

3345
01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.050
<v Bart Decrem:>economy and getting money in here is

3346
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:28.940
<v Bart Decrem:>a big requirement for for this to

3347
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:29.599
<v Bart Decrem:>take off.

3348
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.370
<v Bart Decrem:>Let's add money to the fediverse.

3349
01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.120
<v Bart Decrem:>And so it's kind of like the

3350
01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.460
<v Bart Decrem:>equivalent of like adding money to the

3351
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:34.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Fediverse.

3352
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:36.920
<v Bart Decrem:>So how can you have a premium

3353
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:39.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Twitter feed or premium Mastodon feed?

3354
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:41.420
<v Bart Decrem:>Can I take my WordPress blog and

3355
01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.219
<v Bart Decrem:>have a paywall with some free content,

3356
01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:43.969
<v Bart Decrem:>some paid content?

3357
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:45.500
<v Bart Decrem:>And you can you can follow all

3358
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:47.120
<v Bart Decrem:>of this stuff inside of Ivory.

3359
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.250
<v Bart Decrem:>That's that's a famous Mastodon client or

3360
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:50.210
<v Bart Decrem:>Flipboard.

3361
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:52.700
<v Bart Decrem:>So how can we add money to

3362
01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:53.629
<v Bart Decrem:>this ecosystem.

3363
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:56.269
<v Bart Decrem:>This alternative ecosystem that I am convinced

3364
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:57.830
<v Bart Decrem:>is very important for the future of

3365
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:58.849
<v Bart Decrem:>the open web.

3366
01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:02.060
<v Bart Decrem:>It's open source and an open protocol.

3367
01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.220
<v Bart Decrem:>And and it's called activitypub.

3368
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:05.420
<v Karen Herman:>That's great.

3369
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:07.010
<v Karen Herman:>What exactly is the Fediverse.

3370
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:11.360
<v Karen Herman:>That's that's that's starting to to come

3371
01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.830
<v Karen Herman:>up a lot in discussions.

3372
01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.429
<v Bart Decrem:>Yeah.

3373
01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:16.970
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, to purists the fediverse means activitypub.

3374
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:21.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the fediverse means mastodon and

3375
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:23.269
<v Bart Decrem:>a small number of other apps built

3376
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:25.040
<v Bart Decrem:>on top of Activitypub.

3377
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.580
<v Bart Decrem:>There is, um, there is a Reddit

3378
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.160
<v Bart Decrem:>alternative built on top of Activitypub.

3379
01:40:31.190 --> 01:40:32.300
<v Bart Decrem:>There is a thing.

3380
01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.280
<v Bart Decrem:>There is a TikTok alternative built on

3381
01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.050
<v Bart Decrem:>top of of Activitypub.

3382
01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.160
<v Bart Decrem:>There is a YouTube alternative.

3383
01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:39.110
<v Bart Decrem:>They tend to have thousands and sometimes

3384
01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.520
<v Bart Decrem:>tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.

3385
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:42.230
<v Bart Decrem:>And Mastodon has millions.

3386
01:40:42.230 --> 01:40:42.620
<v Bart Decrem:>But.

3387
01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.630
<v Bart Decrem:>But there's a small number of apps

3388
01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:47.480
<v Bart Decrem:>built on top of these activitypub protocols.

3389
01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.160
<v Bart Decrem:>And to the more Narrow into narrow.

3390
01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.059
<v Bart Decrem:>Definition.

3391
01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:54.620
<v Bart Decrem:>The Fetih verse is a set of

3392
01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.260
<v Bart Decrem:>apps built on top of Activitypub, and

3393
01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.080
<v Bart Decrem:>then you might say we have bridging

3394
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:02.780
<v Bart Decrem:>to the Fediverse from threads, which is

3395
01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.310
<v Bart Decrem:>the Twitter alternative run by meta.

3396
01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.630
<v Bart Decrem:>That one is doing really well.

3397
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:09.049
<v Bart Decrem:>There's limited interoperability, so there's a bridge

3398
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:10.850
<v Bart Decrem:>between the fediverse and threads.

3399
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:13.280
<v Bart Decrem:>There's a bridge between the Fediverse and

3400
01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.470
<v Bart Decrem:>blue Sky, which is another Twitter alternative

3401
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:16.700
<v Bart Decrem:>that's built on a set of other

3402
01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.350
<v Bart Decrem:>protocols that are also open source.

3403
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:21.950
<v Bart Decrem:>Confusingly, my definition of the Fediverse is

3404
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:24.050
<v Bart Decrem:>much more liberal, but I don't like

3405
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:26.300
<v Bart Decrem:>that narrow definition of the fediverse because

3406
01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.140
<v Bart Decrem:>I want to get to a billion

3407
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:28.219
<v Bart Decrem:>people, right?

3408
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:33.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Like, my definition of success is, you

3409
01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.740
<v Bart Decrem:>know, it's about building safe places and

3410
01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.270
<v Bart Decrem:>avoiding some of the pitfalls of the

3411
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.929
<v Bart Decrem:>bigger web.

3412
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:40.849
<v Bart Decrem:>But it's also about doing that for

3413
01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.889
<v Bart Decrem:>100 million people or a billion people,

3414
01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:43.190
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

3415
01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.250
<v Bart Decrem:>And so for me, the fediverse is

3416
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.969
<v Bart Decrem:>activitypub anything that sort of is bridging

3417
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.259
<v Bart Decrem:>enough with it, you know.

3418
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:53.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And so for me, that includes the

3419
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:55.280
<v Bart Decrem:>fediverse includes blue Sky and anything else

3420
01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.500
<v Bart Decrem:>built on the At protocol, the At

3421
01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:59.060
<v Bart Decrem:>protocol underneath it.

3422
01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:03.980
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, it includes threads which I gotta

3423
01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:05.180
<v Bart Decrem:>squint a little bit and be in

3424
01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:06.170
<v Bart Decrem:>a good mood to say that.

3425
01:42:06.170 --> 01:42:08.090
<v Bart Decrem:>But but but but but threads.

3426
01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:12.350
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, it includes, um, it includes RSS.

3427
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, because you can we can easily

3428
01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.790
<v Bart Decrem:>ingest anything that's on RSS.

3429
01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.440
<v Bart Decrem:>We can make it show up in

3430
01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:21.110
<v Bart Decrem:>Ivory and on Mastodon, and I can

3431
01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:22.340
<v Bart Decrem:>support it with Sub Club and so

3432
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:24.380
<v Bart Decrem:>and so my definition of, of, of

3433
01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.730
<v Bart Decrem:>the fediverse is decentralized technologies that bridge

3434
01:42:28.730 --> 01:42:30.230
<v Bart Decrem:>well enough to activitypub.

3435
01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:31.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the world of podcasting, if

3436
01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.810
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm really in a good mood, I

3437
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:35.450
<v Bart Decrem:>would make an argument that podcasting is

3438
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:36.769
<v Bart Decrem:>as a citizen of the fediverse as

3439
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:37.100
<v Bart Decrem:>well.

3440
01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.060
<v Bart Decrem:>That's probably a little bit of an

3441
01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:38.719
<v Bart Decrem:>extreme position.

3442
01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.220
<v Bart Decrem:>So maybe that's a bridge too far,

3443
01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:42.679
<v Bart Decrem:>but it certainly is the ethos, right?

3444
01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.410
<v Bart Decrem:>The the ethos of the open web

3445
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:46.610
<v Bart Decrem:>and open protocols.

3446
01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:49.049
<v Bart Decrem:>And so you can listen to this

3447
01:42:49.050 --> 01:42:51.090
<v Bart Decrem:>podcast in whatever podcasting client you prefer,

3448
01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:51.330
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

3449
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.980
<v Bart Decrem:>That's the spirit to me of the

3450
01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:53.639
<v Bart Decrem:>fediverse.

3451
01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:56.370
<v Bart Decrem:>And we can bicker about sort of

3452
01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:57.900
<v Bart Decrem:>where the definition ends.

3453
01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:01.799
<v Bart Decrem:>But I'm excited about podcasting as one

3454
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.480
<v Bart Decrem:>of the things on the fediverse that

3455
01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.639
<v Bart Decrem:>you can consume in Ivory or mammoth

3456
01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.110
<v Bart Decrem:>or Flipboard and so on.

3457
01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:08.790
<v Bart Decrem:>So I have a very liberal definition.

3458
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:09.509
<v Karen Herman:>Well, that's really cool.

3459
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.890
<v Karen Herman:>Are there any other projects that you're

3460
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:12.000
<v Karen Herman:>working on right now?

3461
01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:13.410
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, no.

3462
01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:13.950
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm working.

3463
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:15.090
<v Bart Decrem:>All of my energy right now is

3464
01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:16.349
<v Bart Decrem:>on Subclip and a little bit on

3465
01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:16.860
<v Bart Decrem:>mammoth.

3466
01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.670
<v Bart Decrem:>And so Subclip is about adding a

3467
01:43:20.670 --> 01:43:21.690
<v Bart Decrem:>creator economy.

3468
01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:23.550
<v Bart Decrem:>So I'm trying to get entrepreneurs to

3469
01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.019
<v Bart Decrem:>show up and start building things on

3470
01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:25.500
<v Bart Decrem:>top of it.

3471
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:28.559
<v Bart Decrem:>So I'm trying to support premium content,

3472
01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:31.230
<v Bart Decrem:>um, work with ghost, which is a

3473
01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:33.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Substack alternative, a newsletter platform that's open

3474
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.630
<v Bart Decrem:>source and has is federating.

3475
01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:38.310
<v Bart Decrem:>So it's becoming part of the Fediverse.

3476
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I think allowing news and publishers

3477
01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:48.299
<v Bart Decrem:>to thrive on the decentralized social web

3478
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:49.200
<v Bart Decrem:>is a.

3479
01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:50.700
<v Bart Decrem:>That's an important cause and mission that

3480
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.410
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm very excited about, and I'm working

3481
01:43:52.410 --> 01:43:54.240
<v Bart Decrem:>on that right now with Soap Hub.

3482
01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:55.020
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

3483
01:43:55.050 --> 01:43:55.470
<v Karen Herman:>What do you think?

3484
01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.030
<v Karen Herman:>What is your biggest fear about the

3485
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.620
<v Karen Herman:>future of the internet?

3486
01:43:59.070 --> 01:44:00.960
<v Bart Decrem:>Well, it's what we're seeing play out,

3487
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.230
<v Bart Decrem:>right?

3488
01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.150
<v Bart Decrem:>It's a world where you have a

3489
01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:07.170
<v Bart Decrem:>small number of massive technology platforms that

3490
01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:09.630
<v Bart Decrem:>have that operate sort of like nation

3491
01:44:09.630 --> 01:44:11.760
<v Bart Decrem:>states and like, you know, like X

3492
01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.930
<v Bart Decrem:>is sort of like the best example

3493
01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:13.920
<v Bart Decrem:>of sort of how that gets real

3494
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.610
<v Bart Decrem:>dark real fast.

3495
01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:15.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Right?

3496
01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and then also, um, the world

3497
01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.580
<v Bart Decrem:>of generative AI that allows you to

3498
01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:22.650
<v Bart Decrem:>sort of just ask questions and get

3499
01:44:22.650 --> 01:44:24.450
<v Bart Decrem:>answers that are sort of safe enough,

3500
01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:25.590
<v Bart Decrem:>but they have sort of a lowest

3501
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:27.300
<v Bart Decrem:>common denominator vibe.

3502
01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:30.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it floods the internet with generic,

3503
01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.240
<v Bart Decrem:>um, content that's low quality.

3504
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:37.349
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and what gets lost is reporters

3505
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:40.950
<v Bart Decrem:>doing investigative reporting and putting years of

3506
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:44.639
<v Bart Decrem:>labor into work, you know, of journalism

3507
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.080
<v Bart Decrem:>and other kinds.

3508
01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.290
<v Bart Decrem:>And what gets lost is, uh, people

3509
01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:51.930
<v Bart Decrem:>connecting and having meaningful dialogue with other

3510
01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:53.099
<v Bart Decrem:>folks, some of whom they agree with,

3511
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.570
<v Bart Decrem:>some of whom they disagree with.

3512
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:57.720
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, I love the promise of the

3513
01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.880
<v Bart Decrem:>internet of we can find our tribe,

3514
01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.110
<v Bart Decrem:>we can talk to people.

3515
01:45:01.110 --> 01:45:03.240
<v Bart Decrem:>Anybody can publish and have their voice

3516
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:04.170
<v Bart Decrem:>be heard.

3517
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:05.700
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and I think that is at

3518
01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:08.160
<v Bart Decrem:>risk as a result of the consolidation

3519
01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.690
<v Bart Decrem:>of the tech space and the small

3520
01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:11.370
<v Bart Decrem:>number of billionaires that are running it.

3521
01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:13.139
<v Bart Decrem:>And as a result of LM that

3522
01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.270
<v Bart Decrem:>is sort of strip mining content created

3523
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:16.110
<v Bart Decrem:>by the Commons.

3524
01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:17.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And so how do we get there

3525
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:19.950
<v Bart Decrem:>to be a viable alternative?

3526
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:21.930
<v Bart Decrem:>And so maybe that ends up being

3527
01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.500
<v Bart Decrem:>the difference between Spotify and vinyl records,

3528
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.150
<v Bart Decrem:>where more people are living in the

3529
01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:29.790
<v Bart Decrem:>world of Spotify, but vinyl records, there's

3530
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.559
<v Bart Decrem:>more of them being sold every year.

3531
01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:34.410
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so maybe it's not about,

3532
01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:38.160
<v Bart Decrem:>um, beating OpenAI and Twitter.

3533
01:45:38.190 --> 01:45:39.360
<v Bart Decrem:>I hate to say it, but maybe

3534
01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.000
<v Bart Decrem:>it's about offering a viable alternatives so

3535
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.140
<v Bart Decrem:>that you can spend most of your

3536
01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.280
<v Bart Decrem:>day relying on ChatGPT.

3537
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:45.960
<v Bart Decrem:>And llms and maybe hanging out on

3538
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Instagram and maybe threads.

3539
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:50.130
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, but here's a place where there's.

3540
01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Authentic conversation between real people.

3541
01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.160
<v Bart Decrem:>And here's a place where.

3542
01:45:53.190 --> 01:45:54.450
<v Bart Decrem:>Journalists are able to do their work

3543
01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:55.589
<v Bart Decrem:>and get paid a fair, a fair

3544
01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.130
<v Bart Decrem:>wages for it.

3545
01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:56.670
<v Bart Decrem:>You know.

3546
01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.080
<v Karen Herman:>Wow.

3547
01:45:58.110 --> 01:45:59.610
<v Karen Herman:>That's a great answer.

3548
01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:00.750
<v Karen Herman:>Um, I want to just ask you

3549
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:01.860
<v Karen Herman:>a little bit about just the open

3550
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.090
<v Karen Herman:>source community.

3551
01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.350
<v Karen Herman:>Um, do you feel like that there's

3552
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:07.290
<v Karen Herman:>something different about people that, um, work

3553
01:46:07.290 --> 01:46:09.690
<v Karen Herman:>in open source that contribute to it?

3554
01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.550
<v Bart Decrem:>Yes.

3555
01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.519
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it it takes all kinds.

3556
01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.920
<v Bart Decrem:>It's very it's diverse community and people

3557
01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.000
<v Bart Decrem:>are there for different reasons.

3558
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.769
<v Bart Decrem:>And, you know, scholars, students, sometimes they're

3559
01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:21.480
<v Bart Decrem:>there to put something on their, you

3560
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.309
<v Bart Decrem:>know, GitHub link on their LinkedIn and

3561
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.820
<v Bart Decrem:>so on and so on.

3562
01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:24.150
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3563
01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:25.530
<v Bart Decrem:>But but if I sort of want

3564
01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.640
<v Bart Decrem:>to simplify it and sort of like

3565
01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.770
<v Bart Decrem:>the two biggest cohorts, you know, that

3566
01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:30.540
<v Bart Decrem:>I've sort of worked with in, you

3567
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:33.000
<v Bart Decrem:>know, across the years and projects, um,

3568
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:35.610
<v Bart Decrem:>it's engineers and non-engineers.

3569
01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:35.880
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3570
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.080
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm a non-engineer.

3571
01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:40.170
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so, uh, on the on

3572
01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:43.740
<v Bart Decrem:>the on the engineering side, it it

3573
01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.020
<v Bart Decrem:>overindexes on folks that are excited about

3574
01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.210
<v Bart Decrem:>their technology that want to learn from

3575
01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Bart Decrem:>others that don't want to reinvent the

3576
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Bart Decrem:>wheel, that don't mind you, that don't,

3577
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:53.880
<v Bart Decrem:>that aren't that aren't trying to squeeze

3578
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.920
<v Bart Decrem:>every little drip out of that lemon,

3579
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:57.059
<v Bart Decrem:>you know, and not trying they're not

3580
01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Bart Decrem:>trying to get the last dollar out

3581
01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.519
<v Bart Decrem:>of their idea.

3582
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:03.000
<v Bart Decrem:>They're trying to explore their curiosity, um,

3583
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:04.560
<v Bart Decrem:>see it out in the world, build

3584
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.209
<v Bart Decrem:>on top of other people's work, advance

3585
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:08.070
<v Bart Decrem:>science and research, you know, and so

3586
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Bart Decrem:>on and so on.

3587
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Bart Decrem:>And then and if it becomes successful,

3588
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.460
<v Bart Decrem:>we'll find a way to make money

3589
01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.990
<v Bart Decrem:>that's usually over there in there somewhere,

3590
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:14.219
<v Bart Decrem:>but in a good way, you know,

3591
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:17.820
<v Bart Decrem:>um, that's the spirit that I find

3592
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.849
<v Bart Decrem:>in Mastodon and that I found at

3593
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:23.849
<v Bart Decrem:>Mozilla and, and Linux in the GNOME

3594
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:25.230
<v Bart Decrem:>community and elsewhere.

3595
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.020
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and then the Non-engineering folks that

3596
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Bart Decrem:>are there, um, we tend to be

3597
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.849
<v Bart Decrem:>pretty lucky.

3598
01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:36.030
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so we go back to

3599
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:39.429
<v Bart Decrem:>traditions of activism and social justice and

3600
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:40.840
<v Bart Decrem:>building a better world.

3601
01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.700
<v Bart Decrem:>And, um.

3602
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:44.800
<v Bart Decrem:>And then when you look back 20

3603
01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.530
<v Bart Decrem:>years in time so often, turns out

3604
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:48.790
<v Bart Decrem:>they were right.

3605
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:49.599
<v Bart Decrem:>We were right.

3606
01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.400
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, whether it be gay marriage

3607
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:53.020
<v Bart Decrem:>or anything or any other social justice

3608
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:53.410
<v Bart Decrem:>movement.

3609
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.040
<v Bart Decrem:>Right?

3610
01:47:54.250 --> 01:47:58.269
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so it's my people.

3611
01:47:59.530 --> 01:48:02.230
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, so, yes, I do find that

3612
01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:05.230
<v Bart Decrem:>it that it organizes and overindexes on

3613
01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:07.809
<v Bart Decrem:>on folks with those with those drives

3614
01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.030
<v Bart Decrem:>building a better world and chasing our

3615
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:11.830
<v Bart Decrem:>curiosity and sharing it with folks.

3616
01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.480
<v Karen Herman:>Has it changed a lot since you

3617
01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.349
<v Karen Herman:>started?

3618
01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:16.810
<v Bart Decrem:>I think so it's gotten more inclusive

3619
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:18.070
<v Bart Decrem:>and better for it.

3620
01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:19.480
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so I think that that's

3621
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:21.430
<v Bart Decrem:>the that's the thing that's been most

3622
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:23.050
<v Bart Decrem:>striking to me is I remember the

3623
01:48:23.050 --> 01:48:24.880
<v Bart Decrem:>flame wars back in the back in

3624
01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.350
<v Bart Decrem:>the Linux and GNOME days, and it

3625
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:28.660
<v Bart Decrem:>was all male and it was very

3626
01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:32.860
<v Bart Decrem:>aggressive and it was very male.

3627
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:34.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, it was sort of a very

3628
01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:38.050
<v Bart Decrem:>male centric ethos around chasing curiosity and

3629
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:39.340
<v Bart Decrem:>hashing out differences.

3630
01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.650
<v Bart Decrem:>And I operate very well in that

3631
01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:43.000
<v Bart Decrem:>world, you know, because it's because because

3632
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.019
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm sort of that kind of, you

3633
01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:45.160
<v Bart Decrem:>know, like like I'm a tech bro.

3634
01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:46.450
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, it's sort of at heart,

3635
01:48:46.450 --> 01:48:46.990
<v Bart Decrem:>it's true.

3636
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:48.220
<v Bart Decrem:>It's just it's just a fact.

3637
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.700
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, what's great about the new wave

3638
01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.990
<v Bart Decrem:>of open source that is coming out

3639
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:54.370
<v Bart Decrem:>of the Mozilla tradition or the Mastodon

3640
01:48:54.370 --> 01:48:55.059
<v Bart Decrem:>community?

3641
01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.400
<v Bart Decrem:>I think we're a lot it's not

3642
01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.500
<v Bart Decrem:>perfect, but it's a lot more sensitive,

3643
01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:02.260
<v Bart Decrem:>uh, to the diversity, to seeking out

3644
01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:06.700
<v Bart Decrem:>voices from, uh, underserved communities, um, to

3645
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:09.250
<v Bart Decrem:>making sure we're, we're building a culture

3646
01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.620
<v Bart Decrem:>that allows folks to express themselves in

3647
01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.310
<v Bart Decrem:>different ways.

3648
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:14.830
<v Bart Decrem:>And that and lets people talk that

3649
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:16.750
<v Bart Decrem:>don't thrive on sort of a in

3650
01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:18.670
<v Bart Decrem:>the trolley world of, you know, of

3651
01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:20.080
<v Bart Decrem:>the brunette of the, you know, of

3652
01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.040
<v Bart Decrem:>the, you know, of the tech bros

3653
01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:21.610
<v Bart Decrem:>and so on and so on.

3654
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.380
<v Bart Decrem:>So I think that's that's very different

3655
01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:24.460
<v Bart Decrem:>than it was 20 years ago.

3656
01:49:24.490 --> 01:49:25.810
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's not perfect and it will

3657
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:26.860
<v Bart Decrem:>keep getting better.

3658
01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.809
<v Bart Decrem:>But, um, but it's great to see

3659
01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:30.430
<v Bart Decrem:>that, you know, there's, it's more diverse

3660
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:33.610
<v Bart Decrem:>voices, greater respect for different approaches, um,

3661
01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:35.110
<v Bart Decrem:>and different life choices.

3662
01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:35.530
<v Karen Herman:>Yeah.

3663
01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.150
<v Karen Herman:>What advice would you give to someone

3664
01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:39.580
<v Karen Herman:>aspiring to be in your field now?

3665
01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:41.740
<v Bart Decrem:>What's my field?

3666
01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.670
<v Karen Herman:>Well, really the, you know, working working

3667
01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Karen Herman:>in open source, but also as a

3668
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.450
<v Karen Herman:>founder CEO, someone who is, you know,

3669
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.360
<v Karen Herman:>generating a lot of ideas and and

3670
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Karen Herman:>projects.

3671
01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Bart Decrem:>How do I have these two things?

3672
01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, like one of them is

3673
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Bart Decrem:>like chase your curiosity.

3674
01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:00.550
<v Bart Decrem:>And then I get annoyed when people

3675
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Bart Decrem:>say that because there's like a privilege

3676
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:04.780
<v Bart Decrem:>in there, you know, like just your

3677
01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Bart Decrem:>curiosity, but chase your passion.

3678
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:09.430
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, I don't know, many of

3679
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:10.629
<v Bart Decrem:>us want to be pop stars and

3680
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Bart Decrem:>stuff, you know?

3681
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Bart Decrem:>And then you're probably not going to

3682
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:13.510
<v Bart Decrem:>be Taylor Swift, right?

3683
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:15.730
<v Bart Decrem:>And so telling people to chase their

3684
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Bart Decrem:>curiosities can it can so often come

3685
01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Bart Decrem:>from a place of privilege, you know,

3686
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Bart Decrem:>and then and then most people on

3687
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:25.120
<v Bart Decrem:>the planet can't afford that.

3688
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:26.589
<v Bart Decrem:>You know, they don't have that privilege.

3689
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:28.089
<v Bart Decrem:>And then many of us, if we

3690
01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:30.309
<v Bart Decrem:>if we chase our passion, my passion

3691
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Bart Decrem:>is surfing.

3692
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.440
<v Bart Decrem:>Maybe I don't know how I'm going

3693
01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Bart Decrem:>to make a living on that.

3694
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.610
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, um, so I'm nervous about that.

3695
01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:38.410
<v Bart Decrem:>But it is what I have done.

3696
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:41.290
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, and so I think for me,

3697
01:50:41.710 --> 01:50:44.769
<v Bart Decrem:>um, and a generation of us, we

3698
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.440
<v Bart Decrem:>are born at a time and place

3699
01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.210
<v Bart Decrem:>in history that's unique.

3700
01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:52.929
<v Bart Decrem:>And if you're curiosity is around technology

3701
01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:55.269
<v Bart Decrem:>and the world that that can shepherd

3702
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:56.410
<v Bart Decrem:>us into.

3703
01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.960
<v Bart Decrem:>That's a good curiosity.

3704
01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Bart Decrem:>Uh, chances are you'll be able to

3705
01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.040
<v Bart Decrem:>get funded and and make a living

3706
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Bart Decrem:>for the next few decades.

3707
01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.969
<v Bart Decrem:>So I do think that that if

3708
01:51:06.970 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Bart Decrem:>you're a nerd and you like to

3709
01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.309
<v Bart Decrem:>build stuff and you're interested in new

3710
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:12.040
<v Bart Decrem:>technology, um, follow your passion and good

3711
01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Bart Decrem:>things are probably going to work out.

3712
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.860
<v Bart Decrem:>It's probably not the worst advice.

3713
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:20.740
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, the mistakes I've made have been

3714
01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:23.110
<v Bart Decrem:>when I spent too much of my

3715
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:28.240
<v Bart Decrem:>time thinking about the world people ought

3716
01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.830
<v Bart Decrem:>to live in and the things people

3717
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:34.540
<v Bart Decrem:>should want, and not enough time solving

3718
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:37.150
<v Bart Decrem:>problems that are really bothering people.

3719
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:40.570
<v Bart Decrem:>And it's hard to fix for that

3720
01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:42.670
<v Bart Decrem:>because I see Elon ruining Twitter and

3721
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:44.470
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm like, let's go make Mastodon better

3722
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:46.059
<v Bart Decrem:>because the world needs it, you know?

3723
01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:50.080
<v Bart Decrem:>But but Firefox got mainstream adoption in

3724
01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Bart Decrem:>a way that Mastodon has not because

3725
01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:54.400
<v Bart Decrem:>we had that normative thing around the

3726
01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:54.849
<v Bart Decrem:>world.

3727
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:56.440
<v Bart Decrem:>The web ought to be open web

3728
01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.009
<v Bart Decrem:>standards.

3729
01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Bart Decrem:>Don't give it to the evil monopolist,

3730
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:59.440
<v Bart Decrem:>all that stuff.

3731
01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.639
<v Bart Decrem:>We had that right.

3732
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.190
<v Bart Decrem:>But also there was a problem.

3733
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Bart Decrem:>This thing is stealing your passwords, you

3734
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.430
<v Bart Decrem:>know, if you're not careful.

3735
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Bart Decrem:>Right.

3736
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.559
<v Bart Decrem:>And we're going to solve that.

3737
01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:11.260
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, and so for those of us

3738
01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:14.680
<v Bart Decrem:>that are imagining a better internet, you

3739
01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.929
<v Bart Decrem:>got to spend 51% of your time

3740
01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.960
<v Bart Decrem:>thinking about what problem are you solving

3741
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.410
<v Bart Decrem:>for, what specific customer, uh, and make

3742
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.170
<v Bart Decrem:>sure you don't under under address that.

3743
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:29.030
<v Bart Decrem:>And sort of where I failed is

3744
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:31.099
<v Bart Decrem:>by spending less than 51% of my

3745
01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.780
<v Bart Decrem:>time worrying about that, you know.

3746
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:33.770
<v Karen Herman:>Gotcha.

3747
01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.150
<v Karen Herman:>That's a good answer.

3748
01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.800
<v Karen Herman:>Um, last question that we're asking everybody

3749
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.120
<v Karen Herman:>is if someone were to come across

3750
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.490
<v Karen Herman:>this interview saying 100 years, you know,

3751
01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.900
<v Karen Herman:>what would you want the next generations

3752
01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:42.110
<v Karen Herman:>to know?

3753
01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:44.360
<v Karen Herman:>What would you want to tell them?

3754
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:48.620
<v Bart Decrem:>Oh, well, we believe that technology has

3755
01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:50.300
<v Bart Decrem:>a lot of risks, you know, and

3756
01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.200
<v Bart Decrem:>downsides.

3757
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Bart Decrem:>But we also have faith, you know,

3758
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.770
<v Bart Decrem:>that technology can solve problems.

3759
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Bart Decrem:>And then if we stay in the

3760
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:58.700
<v Bart Decrem:>driver's seat, um, that we can use

3761
01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Bart Decrem:>this technology to solve important problems and

3762
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Bart Decrem:>that the spirit of the internet and

3763
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Bart Decrem:>people coming together to build technology that

3764
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:07.550
<v Bart Decrem:>we that is solving problems that we

3765
01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.050
<v Bart Decrem:>care about, that that's that that's going

3766
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:09.470
<v Bart Decrem:>to survive.

3767
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:10.849
<v Bart Decrem:>So I hope that that spirit is

3768
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Bart Decrem:>going to be alive in 100 years.

3769
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Bart Decrem:>And the same way that the spirit

3770
01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:17.060
<v Bart Decrem:>of punk and pirate radio from 1970,

3771
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Bart Decrem:>it's 50 years later, right?

3772
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:20.840
<v Bart Decrem:>Um, like I feel that I was

3773
01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Bart Decrem:>listening to a podcast by Chuck D,

3774
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:26.570
<v Bart Decrem:>um, uh, the rapper, uh, about the.

3775
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.290
<v SPEAKER_S3:>Clash.

3776
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Bart Decrem:>And it helped me really see the

3777
01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:31.220
<v Bart Decrem:>connection and why I felt like I

3778
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Bart Decrem:>was listening to The Clash in 1980,

3779
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.620
<v Bart Decrem:>you know.

3780
01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:35.780
<v Bart Decrem:>But to Public Enemy in 2002 or

3781
01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:36.500
<v Bart Decrem:>something, right.

3782
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.090
<v Bart Decrem:>I was like, it's the same thing.

3783
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.950
<v Bart Decrem:>And so the Chuck D podcast helped

3784
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:41.299
<v Bart Decrem:>me sort of see that connective, that

3785
01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Bart Decrem:>connective tissue.

3786
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.330
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm hoping that 50 years from now,

3787
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Bart Decrem:>we're going to see the connective tissue

3788
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Bart Decrem:>between Mastodon and Activitypub and whatever the

3789
01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:50.450
<v Bart Decrem:>cool thing is that is, that is,

3790
01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Bart Decrem:>that is that is in the spirit

3791
01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:53.600
<v Bart Decrem:>of indie developers and power to the

3792
01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.730
<v Bart Decrem:>people and using technology to level the

3793
01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:57.170
<v Bart Decrem:>playing field and to have voices be

3794
01:53:57.170 --> 01:53:58.760
<v Bart Decrem:>heard that otherwise would not be.

3795
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:00.559
<v Karen Herman:>Well, that's a great answer.

3796
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:03.200
<v Karen Herman:>Thank you so, so much, Bart, for

3797
01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:03.860
<v Karen Herman:>this interview.

3798
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Karen Herman:>It's been a pleasure and an honor

3799
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.309
<v Karen Herman:>to interview you, and I hope we'll

3800
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:08.599
<v Karen Herman:>be able to also just keep up

3801
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Karen Herman:>with what what's going on and do

3802
01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:12.890
<v Karen Herman:>do do another interview in a few

3803
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Karen Herman:>years.

3804
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.000
<v Karen Herman:>So thanks.

3805
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.660
<v Karen Herman:>I hope so.

3806
01:54:14.690 --> 01:54:16.190
<v Bart Decrem:>This was great fun, Karen.

3807
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.000
<v Bart Decrem:>Thank you.

3808
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.070
<v Bart Decrem:>I'm going back soon.

3809
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:20.030
<v Karen Herman:>Wait.

3810
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.390
<v Karen Herman:>Hang on.

3811
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.530
<v Karen Herman:>I'm going to stop the.

3812
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:23.450
<v Karen Herman:>Stop it here.

3813
01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:26.150
<v Karen Herman:>I don't know if it's.
